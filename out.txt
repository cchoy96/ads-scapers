But this plan doesn\u2019t just come with an expensive price tag \u2013 it is filled with radical ideas that will weaken our economy and reorder America as we know it.  To be clear, this package:  \u274cForces $2.1 trillion in tax increases on American families and job creators   \u274cImposes Green New Deal polices and destroys American Energy Independence  \u274cAllows over $10 billion in federal funding to go toward abortions  \u274cWeaponizes the IRS by allowing for monitoring and tracking of almost every single bank transaction made  \u274cProvides amnesty to millions and millions of illegal immigrants  \u274cLeaves rural America behind by failing to allocate any funds for critical programs like broadband, the commodity safety net, crop insurance, and disaster assistance  This radical spending package is nothing more than a Trojan Horse for the Democrats to force their extreme socialist agenda on the American people.  And, the American people are already seeing and experiencing the negative consequences of their failed policies \u2013 rising prices, Open Borders, labor shortages.  It is time to bring back the smart, commonsense Republican policies that created a prosperous America with economic growth, record unemployment, and border security.   America\u2019s future is at risk, and we must do everything we can to flight these Far-Left Socialist policies that will only set our country back.

Austin ScottSponsored \u2022 Paid for by Office of Congressman Austin ScottIn September, the Biden Administration proposed a new rule that would expand the IRS\u2019s data collection on millions of Americans. The rule would require financial institutions and other financial service providers to report all inflows and outflows on accounts that have more than $600. This proposal would be a huge privacy issue for Americans and create an expensive undue burden on our local banks and credit unions.  Here are 5 ways that you could find yourself surveilled by the agency:  1. Sending your child to college. You worked hard, you saved, and now that investment in your child\u2019s future will pull you into the IRS dragnet.  2. Taking out a loan to buy equipment. Want to start a new business or invest in your current one? That\u2019ll cost you your privacy.  3. Selling goods at a farmer\u2019s market or Etsy shop. Do you create something or grow something and sell it directly to a consumer? If you did and deposited those dollars into a bank account, you\u2019ll be reported.  4. Saving for and making a large purchase. Want to buy a new car? Or do some home renovations? Or take your family on a trip? Your bank accounts will wind up in a dragnet.  5. Purchasing groceries for a family of four. With the cost of groceries skyrocketing under inflation \u2013 your account will be reported to the IRS even sooner.  Over the last several weeks, Americans have voiced their outrage over this invasion of privacy, including countless Middle and South Georgians. In response to the public outcry, Congressional Democrats and the Biden Administration are trying to save face, but proposed updates to the proposed rule would still pose a gross overreach into the private financial lives of Americans., I recently joined dozens of colleagues in sending a letter to President Biden on this issue.

It could be spotted from miles away!  As a psychologist, watching the political back and forth in the USA over the past 5 years is pretty incredible. Seeing people say what they\u2019ve said, behaved in the way they\u2019ve behaved, and made the decisions they\u2019ve made has been interesting to watch. It\u2019s also illuminated a very clear truth.  The reason why Trump-haters \u201chate\u201d Trump so much is not because they actually hate Trump the person. Because they don\u2019t even know him. They\u2019re definitely not protesting Trump\u2019s competence or political policies. Because, well, let\u2019s face it, he did an incredible job with our economy, protected the people inside the country with strong borders, and won the respect of so many around the world. Allies felt supported. Enemies knew not to mess. Prospects knew to tread carefully. And he did it all so confidently, unabashedly, unapologetically. How attractive!  So the question remains, if it\u2019s not his personality, and it\u2019s not his policies, what is it? \u2028\u2028Notice that people who have been critical of Trump tend to be very reactionary in their position. It\u2019s a highly emotional topic for them. It stirs up a lot. Interestingly, the reaction has been so powerful and pervasive that it even has its own syndrome!  And therein lies the answer to this question. The people who have been so vehemently \u201copposed\u201d to Trump are not really against Trump. They\u2019re upset at what Trump triggers deep inside them. That is what they're reacting to when they hear \"Trump.\" Trump reminds many of the unprocessed anger they have towards authority figures in their lives. Maybe an angry father. Perhaps a controlling mother. Possibly an abusive boss. For many people, the idea of Trump has woken (no pun intended) up tremendous emotional pain and psychological trauma that these people have not dealt with. And that they have not wanted to deal with.  Psychologically-speaking, that\u2019s how we got here. That\u2019s why \u201cso many picked\u201d Biden. I put it in quotes because they didn\u2019t really pick Biden. They just wanted to escape Trump. Or I should say, the painful memories that Trump stirred up inside them. Was Trump opinionated? Of course he was. Was he outlandish in his delivery at times? Absolutely. Did he come across as arrogant and egotistical at points? Without question. It\u2019s all true!!!  But objectively, that is what you want in a President of the USA. That is what you want from your Commander in Chief. That is what you want from the guy who\u2019s sole responsibility and duty is to go up to bat for you. You want someone who will unabashedly stand up for you, guard you, and protect your interests with everything he\u2019s got when it comes down to the wire.  The truth is, to guard and protect properly, sometimes you have to be bold. You have be direct. You have to be aggressive. Otherwise, some won\u2019t hear you. They will not respect you. They will manipulate you. And they will walk all over you.  To the \u201cTrump haters,\u201d I feel for you. Living this way must be complete emotional hell. Because you\u2019re always on the run. Your life is driven by fear. You make decisions that are based in anxiety and avoidance. You\u2019re constantly looking to make choices not that you necessarily personally believe in, but because they are less \u201ctriggering.\u201d And unfortunately, sometimes it leads to this. The truth about Biden is clear to everyone now. At least it should be. He was never fit to be a leader in this capacity. The writing was on the wall from the very beginning. Some decided to see it. Others were too scared to. Because it stirred up too much. It\u2019s okay. You didn\u2019t know.  Hopefully, this incident can be used as an opportunity for you to exercise the courage to look inside and see what your triggers in life actually are. Consider. Who talked down to you growing up? Who hurt you? Who made you feel so little ? Pay attention to it. Process it. Address it.  You will see better. Decide better. And live better.  www.WestLaPsychologist.com\u200bInactiveOct 18, 2021 - Oct 19, 2021Platforms\u200bCategories\u200bEstimated Audience Size: 500K - 1M peopleAmount spent (USD): <$100Impressions: <1KID: 200947628815609Open Dropdown\u200bSee Ad DetailsIdaho Young RepublicansSponsored \u2022 Paid for by Idaho Young RepublicansOver the past few months, President Biden continues to push America towards an authoritarian state. He recently announced a proposal that financial institutions report transactional activity for any bank account that has an inflow, outflow, or aggregate amount totaling $600 in a year.   This bar for monitoring is so low that most citizens on unemployment, social security benefits, and Medicare would have every financial transaction monitored.  To bring it to a more personal level, if your child takes a summer job mowing lawns and opens a savings account for that funding, then he or she would likely be monitored as well.  While the stated goal of this vast data collection is to uncover tax dodging by the wealthy, this proposal is not remotely targeted to that purpose or population.  Last time we checked, the median household here in Idaho is roughly $61,000 a year. Nearly every Idahoan family would be on that list from monitoring as one of the \"rich\" paying their share.  The false pretense of closing the tax-gap would give unprecedented data collection authority to the federal government with limited return on investment for citizens.   It is also unclear how the IRS will use this data to accomplish its goal.  Further, the federal government\u2019s history of keeping this type of data secure is dubious at best. The IRS is one of several government systems that has recently experienced a data breach and financial institutions across the country are highly concerned about the government\u2019s ability to keep personal financial data secure.  Let\u2019s be real\u2026 this is an unprecedented invasion of privacy masquerading as an effort to reduce the tax gap.  This is not acceptable and Congress must act.\u200bInactiveOct 17, 2021 - Oct 22, 2021Platforms\u200bCategories\u200bEstimated Audience Size: 10K - 50K peopleAmount spent (USD): <$100Impressions: 4K - 5KID: 995238311037267Open Dropdown\u200bSee Ad DetailsCongresswoman Ashley HinsonSponsored \u2022 Paid for by official funds authorized by the House of RepresentativesRead full article: Congresswoman Hinson blasts Democrat spending plan\u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f  Iowa First District Congresswoman Ashley Hinson, a Republican from Marion, voted against raising the debt limit in the House Tuesday. \u201cWe are hearing the Democrats in Washington D-C talking about cutting a trillion or two from a multitrillion-dollar social spending spree like they should get a pat on the back for that for being fiscally responsible,\u201d Hinson says. \u201d And I think it is very clear to Iowans that these are not nickles and dimes \u2014 we are dealing in trillions of dollars here. And the Democrats have forgotten how many zeros are in trillions.\u201d  Hinson says her vote sends a message on Democrat spending. \u201cIt is critical of course, that we do not default on our debt. But it is equally important that we don\u2019t let democrats spend as much as they want on whatever they want to. Or to signal to them that we will give them a pathway to do that in the future,\u201d she says.  A proposal to have banks track accounts with 600 dollars or more in them is part of the Democrats\u2019 spending proposal. Hinson is not in favor of the idea. \u201cIt\u2019s a completely invasive policy, we heard Speaker Pelosi acknowledge that for the first time,\u201d Hinson says.  The Biden Administration says the proposal is designed to find people who are NOT paying taxes they owe. \u201cI can tell you loud and clear Iowans do not want the I-R-S to monitor when they are paying their bills or making a big grocery store run. I think about families making a big trip to Costco or HyVee and stocking up. Why does the government need to know that? That\u2019s exactly why I have been leading the charge against this in Washington D-C with my legislation, the Protecting Financial Privacy Act,\u201d according to Hinson.  Hinson says the proposal is a way to expand the size of the I-R-S. \u201cWe need more border patrol agents \u2014 not more I-R-S agents right now,\u201d Hinson says.

And that divide only deepens when we see Biden and the democrats saying things like the unvaccinated people were \"not nearly as smart as I thought you were.\" We see the media pushing narratives like blaming the unvaccinated for the continuation of the pandemic, Biden's poor approval numbers, hindering economic growth, costing jobs, and putting unnecessary strain on the healthcare system.

And the most common narrative being pushed out of the Whitehouse and in the media is that the unvaccinated are being labeled unemployable and are being ostracized from society so that we can protect the vaccinated from the unvaccinated because the unvaccinated refuse to get the vaccine that didn't protect the vaccinated in the first place.  Personal agency over our own lives is one of the most fundamental tenents of a free society. If you have chosen to be vaccinated because you believe it protects you and it is what's best for you, then it shouldn't matter if others are vaccinated because you are protected. And if you are unvaccinated because you believe that it is your right to make healthcare decisions for yourself and your family, then what someone else's healthcare choices are should be none of your concern. We have somehow found ourselves in this quasi-socialist communist place where too many Americans now believe the interests of society somehow trump those of the individual. Our nation was founded on the rights of the individual, not those of the community. And if we desire to continue to remain a free society and have personal agency over our lives, we must move away from this collectivist ideology and return to the ideology of individual rights spelled out by our founders, which has served us well for nearly 250 years.  And it starts by electing people who are willing to stand up for you and fight for your individual rights. I will go to Austin to represent you! Not the special interest groups and lobbyists.

I am willing to invest millions to ensure a right-wing extremist does not take over the U.S. Senate. I will be on the ballot in 2022 under any circumstance. I was told by a senior member of the GOP \"Everett, do not split the party.\" My response to that person is: \"I will do whatever is necessary to protect the Constitution of the United States and help ALL Americans. I will not take part in undermining democracy.\"  I cannot emphasize enough that on September 11th we all looked at each other as Americans. Politics faded away. The negativity and anger must end. I am inspired and want to continue this U.S. Senate race because I have hope that reason, logic, and the words of our founding fathers will prevail.  Recently, I have taken a tremendous amount of heat from the far right for standing up for what is right and what I believe in. Character. I do the right thing. I promote Justice, fight Corruption, and hold people accountable. There must be unity in the Republican Party and I am on a mission to bring everyone together. We are ALL Americans. I am not a politician. I am a fighter. Big difference. Please google my name to see my background.  I am bringing up issues that certain Republicans may not want to hear but need to address. The Republican Party is blocking me from events because I have a different view and is shifting hard right. Moderate Republicans are leaving the party in droves. The hard-right movement is loud but I do not believe it is the majority. We need a political movement that does not want to fight or a war with Democrats but wants to compromise and work together. #politics #CNN #FoxNews #USSenate #pennsylvania #Trump2024 #Republicans #GOP #Democrats #Biden\u200bInactiveOct 9, 2021 - Oct 17, 2021Platforms\u200bCategories\u200bEstimated Audience Size: >1M peopleAmount spent (USD): $100 - $199Impressions: 30K - 35KID: 381219320057804Open Dropdown\u200bSee Ad DetailsFackrell for SenateSponsored \u2022 Paid for by Michael William FackrellDear Georgians,  President Biden is implementing a spending plan designed to inflate the cost of goods and services by at least 70% over the next 2 years. Xi Jinping is assisting him with this operation/attack.  They are manipulating our supply chain while they prepare to flood the system with cash.  It's why you see hundreds of ships in the ocean full of products that can't be unloaded.  They are preparing to overwhelm the system with cash, at which point they will unleash the massive buildup of products into the market place all at once.  Prices will spike dramatically in a matter of weeks.

This is nearly as many crossings as we saw in 2020 over the entire YEAR.  Despite the tragic realities of Biden's self-made crisis, his administration is lying to the American people, ignoring recommendations from senior leaders on the ground, releasing thousands of unvetted migrants into the country, and terminating the highly-effective Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP).   It is past time for President Biden to admit that the Trump Administration\u2019s border policies\u2014like the border wall and MPP\u2014worked. He must acknowledge that there is a crisis at the southern border and that the men and women of the United States Border Patrol are overwhelmed.

Religious exemption claims to the C-19 vaccine mandate are increasing in workplaces across the nation.  Employers and employees are not clear on the process for making a claim or processing one.  Employees are experiencing concern and pressure.  Courts around the nation are starting to weigh in on the issue.  Here is a summary of related and notable events I have compiled on the topic that may be helpful to you:   - In 1905 and 1922, SCOTUS upheld the right to impose vaccination requirements on the general public. (Jacobson v. Massachusetts (1905); Zucht v. King (1922)).  However, neither of these cases addressed religious exemption.  - 12/21/2020 \u2013 Vatican announced C-19 vaccine is \u201cmorally acceptable.\u201d  - 09/09/2021 \u2013 President Biden issues Executive Order requiring C-19 vaccination for most federal employees and federal contractors.  The EO allows federal employees to claim medical and religious exemptions.    The right to request a religious exemption stems from Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.    Sincerely Held Religious Belief:  EEOC guidance provides that employers should accept an employee\u2019s claim of a sincerely held religious belief unless the employer has an objective basis to deny the exemption.   Reasonable Accommodation:  The EEOC states employers must provide reasonable accommodations for workers who have sincerely held religious beliefs, unless doing so poses an undue hardship.  The EEOC\u2019s guidance provides that accommodating a religious belief may be an undue hardship if it compromises workplace safety.  Employers are encouraged to engage in the \u201cinteractive process\u201d for determining reasonable accommodation.    - 09/16/2021 \u2013 The Safer Federal Workforce Task Force issued guidance regarding exemptions stating an agency may be required to provide reasonable accommodation to employees who claim exemption based upon a sincerely held religious belief.   - 08/2021 \u2013 United Airlines becomes the first U.S. carrier to require C-19 vaccinations for all domestic employees.  United planned to put employees who received religious exemptions on temporary unpaid personal leave starting Oct. 2.  As a result of at least 2 lawsuits against United, those plans have been put on hold.   - 08/12/2021 \u2013 SCOTUS denied review of a challenge from a group of Indiana Univ. students against Indiana Univ.\u2019s vaccine requirement.  Indiana Univ.\u2019s vaccine mandate allows for a religious exemption.  - 08/23/2021 \u2013 FDA granted full approval to the Pfizer C-19 vaccine.  - 08/27/2021 \u2013 Harris and Cluett v. University of Massachusetts - Massachusetts court upheld UMass\u2019s denial of a Catholic student\u2019s religious exemption claim stating the Catholic Church declared the vaccine to be \u201cmorally justified\u201d and noting that the student had received other vaccinations as a prerequisite to attending school.  - 09/09/2021 \u2013 President Biden announces the \u201cPath out of the Pandemic\u201d initiative which will extend the vaccine mandate to the private sector.  - 09/15/2021 \u2013 Pope Francis encouraged the public to take the vaccine stating he and almost everyone in the Vatican is vaccinated.  - 09/30/2021 \u2013 Federal Appeals Court ruled that New York must grant temporary exemptions to unvaccinated health care workers claiming religious exemption.  - Does HIPPA prohibit an employer from requiring an employee to disclose whether the employee has received the C-19 vaccine?  No. Generally, HIPPA laws only apply to HIPPA covered entities, such as: health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses.Launched September 2021\u200bInactiveSep 30, 2021 - Sep 30, 2021Platforms\u200bCategories\u200bEstimated Audience Size: >1M peopleAmount spent (USD): <$100Impressions: <1KThis ad ran without a disclaimer\u200bID: 276171374325458Open Dropdown\u200bSee Ad DetailsWhat the Hell is Going On?Sponsored85,000 More Haitians are marching to BIDEN'S OPEN BORDER.
