"Political ideologies should not be forced on to students in public schools funded by taxpayers. I am a conservative; conservative values are useful throughout ones life. Schools should teach an accurate and not always pleasant history of our great country without forcing radical political ideologies like CRT. Teach the constitution and founding fathers without allegiance to a certain political party.  Lansing has students not performing at grade level and who are not college-ready when they graduate. Back to basics in education. A conservative approach when it comes to the budget and allocation of funds is what I feel this district needs. Throwing more tax dollars at problems will not make them go away. Funding has steadily increased over the last 10 years while student performance declines. In the end voters can decide for themselves but I won't apologize for my beliefs. Voters are smart enough to decide and vote on what is important to them. I am honest about how I feel. I won't tell you how to vote but I will tell you how I feel. Two other candidates align with my views: Jeff Bollin and Mary Wood. I make no secret of that. If elected working together as a team on the board will be essential and not something that should be chastised just because one might not like our viewpoints. Again let the voters decide. I have been very open. You know what you get when you vote for me. It's too bad some other candidates tend to dodge basic questions.  Accountability and transparency with the board are two other areas I feel strongly about. I believe every vote by your elected officials should be recorded and readily available to the constituents. The board needs to be accountable to taxpayers parents and students.  Respect parental rights and authority. This is one reason I am opposed to any mandatory masks or mandatory Covid vaccinations. These are personal healthcare decisions made by parents with their child and doctor. These personal decisions should also be left up to teachers staff and volunteers.  Work climate. I have received many complaints about a negative work environment in the district. I feel this should be properly looked at so we can keep and attract quality teachers and staff.  CRT is an important nonpartisan issue to me. Everyone should always be treated equal and not judged by the color of their skin. CRT is not something I will dismiss or ignore until it has ""officially"" arrived in Lansing.",political,Facebook
COVID AND TRANSPORTATION Due to the significant decrease in transportation and people driving cars since the start of the pandemic there has been a notable decrease in emissions globally. In some ways the pandemic provided a much needed reset and sigh of relief to the Earth to slow us down as humans for a few months and let the Earth take a break from our onslaught of damage to her. In reflection we should reassess whether the amount of transportation we have exercised in the past is really necessary. If people have been able to work at home just as well as they could burning hundreds (or thousands) of gallons of fuel each year to drive to their office every day then it forces the question: Why go back to driving to the office at all? Multiply every person's round trip commute by five days a week 50+ weeks a year and then consider how many millions of people commute every day. The fact that there was a significant reduction in emissions when the pandemic hit and many were forced to work from home is no surprise. In the end the pandemic gives us an opportunity to rethink how we operate as a society and to consider resetting and transforming so many ways in which we function to be less reckless less destructive and less selfish as a society. Covid-19 has been challenging for all of us but it has given us an opportunity to look seriously at ourselves as a species and how we impact the environment. This is our opportunity to evolve. We need the will -- politically socially and individually -- to enlighten ourselves collectively and evolve into better residents of the only habitable planet we have.,political,Facebook
A Green New Deal has become a charged term where some people fear that airplanes and cars will be banned because of considerable disinformation from certain political pockets. A Maine Green Deal New Green Deal Maine Compact for Clean Energy: Call it what you will but here is what I support. The conversion of the former Maine Yankee to a facility capable of transferring 156 GW of energy developed by offshore wind turbines would in itself create thousands of jobs and make Maine 100% powered by clean energy by 2030. Investing in solar for housing would create thousands of jobs. Also important in the effort to reduce emissions is to incentivize the sale and purchases of electric- or hybrid-powered personal vehicles and the development of a statewide infrastructure of electric charging stations to make mobility by electric power accessible and practical. These are all solutions that would help us achieve the goals of emission reduction and 100% clean energy as well as create thousands of jobs that will stimulate Maine's economy. In turn Maine's reputation as an environmental leader will bolster and increase environmental tourism in the state also improving our economy. The environment is our economic stimulus post-Covid. We have the ability to both do good on the environment AND jumpstart a new economy all in one fell swoop if our government is able to keep up with the will of the people.  *Benjamin Meiklejohn is endorsed by .,political,Facebook
Racism is cultivated and we have to pull it from the roots  You cant address racism in adults and think it will stop if we dont pull the racism out from the roots. Racism is cultivated and the roots take hold in childhood.  I spent my entire life save my time at Howard University receiving an education at a cost to my well-being. I want my children Adeline and Langston to receive an education without receiving the bigotry and racism that were a condition of mine.  My mother has always called me an idealist. She always says that I cant change the world. And I always respond to her I can try. I instill this directive into my children. I require them and teach them how to speak up for anyone being marginalized. I require them to not marginalize for any reason. I dont feel many of her peers are being taught the same thing at home. And to be clear not talking about it is just as detrimental. If you truly want our children to be their authentic selves then we have to provide an environment for that to happen. We have to nourish and cultivate that environment so our kids can grow into successful human beings.  We currently have a President of the United States who when asked if he denounces white supremacy cant just say Yes I unequivocally denounce it and it has no place in our country. He will not say it. Please understand Im not bringing this up to be political. Denouncing any kind of supremacy should not be a political stance. Im bringing it up because this is what many if not the majority feel about white supremacy. It is what they feel about systemic racism. Remember what I said earlier not talking about it is just as detrimental. They will not say they support it but they will not say they denounce it or they will not talk about it at all. I can say this because he won the presidency. Almost half the voters cast their ballot for someone with this ideology and it may happen again. This country voted for a man that said that he could just grab a womans vagina.  My point is this. If you voted for these ideals you are definitely complicit. But dont think because you didnt vote for these ideals that these ideals dont exist in your standard operating procedure. It is built into our society and history proves it to be so. Donald Trump is just a person but the ideology is systemic. Systemic racism systemic misogyny systemic gender and sexual inequality are all deeply rooted in our society. They are built in. To think a liberal person regardless of race has weeded out these ideals would be an unreasonable assertion. Weeds grow back if they are not consistently maintained.  Im asking everyone to pull the weeds. Im asking you to begin that process with our children. Im asking you to not make this a political problem. If you think racism doesnt affect you you are wrong because you see it is affecting you now. I am asking you to love our children.,political,Facebook

"I read this letter every now and then. It reminds how much we owe to those that fight and protect us- It's a bit long but an excellent read.  This letter was written by Charles Grennel and his comrades who are veterans of the Global War on Terror. Grennel is an Army Reservist who spent two years in Iraq and was a principal in putting together the first Iraqi elections January of 2005. It was written to (left students name out on purpose) who is one of the students at the University of Washington who did not want to honor Medal of Honor winner USMC Colonel Greg Boyington because she does not think those who serve in the U.S. Armed services are good role models.  To: Addressee (student UW)  Subject: Sheep Wolves and Sheepdogs  Dear Miss xxxxxxxx  I read of your student activity regarding the proposed memorial to Col Greg Boyington USMC a Medal of Honor winner. I suspect you will receive a bellyful of angry e-mails from conservative folks like me. You may be too young to appreciate fully the sacrifices of generations of servicemen and servicewomen on whose shoulders you and your fellow students stand. I forgive you for the untutored ways of youth and your naivet. It may be that you are simply a sheep. There's no dishonor in being a sheep--as long as you know and accept what you are.  William J. Bennett in a lecture to the United States Naval Academy November 24 1997 said ""Most of the people in our society are sheep. They are kind gentle productive creatures who can only hurt one another by accident.""  We may well be in the most violent times in history but violence is still remarkably rare. This is because most citizens are kind decent people who are not capable of hurting each other except by accident or under extreme provocation. They are sheep. Then there are the wolves and the wolves feed on the sheep without mercy. Do you believe there are wolves out there that will feed on the flock without mercy? You better believe it. There are evil men in this world and they are capable of evil deeds. The moment you forget that or pretend it is not so you become a sheep. There is no safety in denial.  Then there are sheepdogs and I'm a sheepdog. I live to protect the flock and confront the wolf. If you have no capacity for violence then you are a healthy productive citizen--a sheep. If you have a capacity for violence and no empathy for your fellow citizens then you have defined an aggressive sociopath--a wolf. But what if you have a capacity for violence and a deep love for your fellow citizens? What do you have then? A sheepdog a warrior someone who is walking the uncharted path. Someone who can walk into the heart of darkness into the universal human phobia and walk out unscathed.  We know that the sheep live in denial--that is what makes them sheep. They do not want to believe that there is evil in the world. They can accept the fact that fires can happen which is why they want fire extinguishers fire sprinklers fire alarms and fire exits throughout their kids' schools. But many of them are outraged at the idea of putting an armed police officer in their kids school. Our children are thousands of times more likely to be killed or seriously injured by school violence than fire but the sheep's only response to the possibility of violence is denial. The idea of someone coming to kill or harm their child is just too hard and so they choose the path of denial.  The sheep generally do not like the sheepdog. He looks a lot like the wolf. He has fangs and the capacity for violence. The difference though is that the sheepdog must not cannot and will not ever harm the sheep. Any sheep dog that intentionally harms the lowliest little lamb will be punished and removed. The world cannot work any other way at least not in a representative democracy or a republic such as ours. Still the sheepdog disturbs the sheep. He is a constant reminder that there are wolves in the land. They would prefer that he didn't tell them where to go or give them traffic tickets or stand at the ready in our airports in camouflage fatigues holding an M-16. The sheep would much rather have the sheepdog cash in his fangs spray paint himself white and go ""baa""--until the wolf shows up. Then the entire flock tries desperately to hide behind one lonely sheepdog.  The students the victims at Columbine High School were big tough high school students and under ordinary circumstances they would not have had the time of day for a police officer. They were not bad kids; they just had nothing to say to a cop. When the school was under attack however and SWAT teams were clearing the rooms and hallways the officers had to physically peel those clinging sobbing kids off of them. This is how the little lambs feel about their sheepdog when the wolf is at the door.  Look at what happened after September 11 2001 when the wolf pounded hard on the door. Remember how America more than ever before felt differently about their law enforcement officers and military personnel? Understand that there is nothing morally superior about being a sheepdog; it is just what you choose to be. Also understand that a sheepdog is a funny critter: He is always sniffing around out on the perimeter checking the breeze barking at things that go bump in the night and yearning for a righteous battle. That is the young sheepdogs yearn for a righteous battle. The old sheepdogs are a little older and wiser but they move to the sound of the guns when needed right along with the young ones.  Here is how the sheep and the sheepdog think differently. The sheep pretend the wolf will never come but the sheepdog lives for that day. After the attacks on September 11 2001 most of the sheep that is most citizens in America said ""Thank God I wasn't on one of those planes."" The sheepdogs the warriors said ""Dear God I wish I could have been on one of those planes. Maybe I could have made a difference."" You want to be able to make a difference. There is nothing morally superior about the sheepdog the warrior but he does have one real advantage. Only one. And that is that he is able to survive and thrive in an environment that destroys 98 percent of the population.  There was research conducted a few years ago with individuals convicted of violent crimes. These cons were in prison for serious predatory crimes of violence: assaults murders and killing law enforcement officers. The vast majority said that they specifically targeted victims by body language: Slumped walk passive behavior and lack of awareness. They chose their victims like big cats do in Africa when they select one out of the herd that is least able to protect itself. Some people may be destined to be sheep and others might be genetically primed to be wolves or sheepdogs. But I believe that most people can choose which one they want to be and I'm proud to say that more and more Americans are choosing to become sheepdogs.  Seven months after the attack on September 11 2001 Todd Beamer was honored in his hometown of Cranbury New Jersey. Todd as you recall was the man on Flight 93 over Pennsylvania who called on his cell phone to alert an operator from United Airlines about the hijacking. When they learned of the other three passenger planes that had been used as weapons Todd and the other passengers confronted the terrorist hijackers. In one hour a transformation occurred among the passengers--athletes business people and parents--from sheep to sheepdogs and together they fought the wolves ultimately saving an unknown number of lives on the ground.  ""There is no safety for honest men except by believing all possible evil of evil men."" - Edmund Burke.  Here is the point I would like to emphasize especially to the thousands of police officers and soldiers I speak to each year. In nature the sheep real sheep are born as sheep. Sheepdogs are born that way and so are wolves. They didn't have a choice. But you are not a critter. As a human being you can be whatever you want to be. It is a conscious moral decision. If you want to be a sheep then you can be a sheep and that is okay but you must understand the price you pay. When the wolf comes you and your loved ones are going to die if there is not a sheepdog there to protect you. If you want to be a wolf you can be one but the sheepdogs are going to hunt you down and you will never have rest safety trust or love. But if you want to be a sheepdog and walk the warrior's path then you must make a conscious and moral decision every day to dedicate equip and prepare yourself to thrive in that toxic corrosive moment when the wolf comes knocking at the door.  This business of being a sheep or a sheep dog is not a yes-no dichotomy. It is not an all-or-nothing either-or choice. It is a matter of degrees a continuum. On one end is an abject head-in-the-sand-sheep and on the other end is the ultimate warrior. Few people exist completely on one end or the other. Most of us live somewhere in between. Immediately after 9-11 almost everyone in America took a step up that continuum away from denial. The sheep took a few steps toward accepting and appreciating their warriors and the warriors started taking their job more seriously. Now the sheep have again begun to despise the sheepdogs as those who represent unending violence and deny the real dangers of the wolves.  Its OK to be a sheep but do not kick the sheep dog. Indeed the sheep dog may just run a little harder strive to protect a little better and be fully prepared to pay an ultimate price in battle and spirit with the sheep moving from ""Baa"" to ""thanks"". We do not call for gifts or freedoms beyond our lot. We just need a small pat on the head a smile and a thank you to fill the emotional tank that is drained protecting the sheep. And when our number is called by ""The Almighty"" and day retreats into night a small prayer before the heavens just may be in order to say thanks for letting you continue to be a sheep. And be grateful for the thousandsmillions--of American sheepdogs who permit you the freedom to express even bad ideas.  Sincerely Charles Grennel --",political,Facebook

Uncommon Sense The Siwiec Report Issue 43 -- Wednesday October 28 2020  Second Opinions  Every great advance in science has issued from a new audacity of imagination.  John Dewey <> Nearly all men can stand adversity but if you want to test a mans character give him power  Robert Green Ingersoll  Resistance to change can be helpful or harmful. It cuts both ways. Nowhere is this more evident than in medicine. There has been an impressive evolution of knowledge and practice in medical science which has taken place over thousands of years marked by discoveries and advances that have alleviated suffering and prevented disease.  Advances in the sciences and notably in medicine happen over the long-term through a process of trial and error. Medical science like all authentic science builds a base of useful (practical) knowledge through observation and measurement. Over time hypotheses are formulated and tested experimentation is employed findings are interpreted and the body of knowledge grows. Science by definition is not a capricious undertaking.  The state of medical science at any point in time is open to revision adapting to new data and replacing theories that do not measure up. The medical establishment will circle the wagons around a prevailing theory and practice and resist theories that challenge the state of current medical certitude. This is a healthy resistance. A hypothesis that challenges the current state of medical practice must pass rigorous and demanding tests. The question must always be wheres the proof.  Louis Pasteur (1822-1895) was a French biologist who proposed the germ theory of disease. He sought to prove that diseases were caused by microorganisms. Pasteur trailblazed the field of bacteriology and displaced the theory of the spontaneous generation of disease with the germ theory. Prior to the late 1800s medicine and surgery were practiced without the knowledge that germs could cause disease. Imagine how we would be coping with the current pandemic without the knowledge that a pathogen like coronavirus caused Covid19. We would be dealing with a death rate like that in the middle ages when waves of bubonic plague wiped out fifty percent of Europes population.  Only a few decades ago medical practitioners believed that stomach ulcers were caused by stress and excess acid. The typical ulcer sufferer was depicted as a businessman with a type-A personality who needed to swig Maalox to make it through a hectic day of meetings and business deals. However that overriding medical consensus was challenged by a physician from down under who was convinced that peptic pain and duodenal distress was brought on by a bacterium.  The medical establishment scoffed and disparaged the doctor from the boondocks of Western Australia. If the doctors at the Mayo Clinic and Harvard University said ulcers were caused by stress and acid you could rest assured that ulcers were caused by stress and acid. The only problem was that they were not the cause and the Aussie with his own microscope and the audacity to experiment on himself would prove them wrong.  Barry Marshall (b. 1951) is an Australian physician and researcher who together with his research partner Robin Warren (b. 1937) set out to prove that the vast majority of ulcers including those that lead to stomach cancer are caused by the bacterium Helicobacter pylori. Marshall performed biopsies on ulcer patients at the Royal Perth Hospital cultured the specimens and discovered that the ulcers were associated with H pylori bacteria. He hypothesized that antibiotics could cure these infections. However mainstream gastroenterologists dismissed his findings. For years they had been treating ulcers with antacid therapies. They believed that bacteria could not survive in the highly acidic environment of the stomach. In addition to the pushback Marshall was up against from the international medical establishment big drug companies were aware that if Marshall were correct their huge investment in antacid drug products would be at risk. Marshall said  Because the makers of H2 blockers funded much of the ulcer research at the time all they had to do was ignore the Heliobacter discovery.  Marshall knew he had made a discovery that would change the way ulcers were treated saving millions from pain and agony by preventing the major cause of stomach cancer. Since the bacterium H pylori only affects primates and Marshall was prohibited from experimenting on humans he became desperate. He only had one patient upon whom he could experiment  himself.  First he had a baseline endoscopy which was normal. Then he obtained bacteria from the stomach of an ulcer patient mixed it in a broth and drank it. Within days tests indicated massive inflammation. He began vomiting and was exhausted. He biopsied his own gut and cultured the specimen. It indicated that H pylori survived the acidic environment. His hypothesis was proven. The world of medicine could no longer resist the scientifically obvious. Heliobacter pylori was the cause of ulcers in the stomach.  In 2005 Barry Marshall was awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine.  ____________________________________________  The discovery of bacteria as the cause of stomach ulcers was not immediately accepted by the medical establishment. It would take approximately two decades before common medical practice adapted to Dr. Marshalls breakthrough scientific finding. Today ulcers are routinely treated with antibiotics. Although prudent medical reticence and the power of big pharma initially resisted and delayed the application of Marshalls discovery his incontrovertible evidence would eventually prevail.  At about the time that Marshalls discovery was fully acknowledged another medical development would begin to stir controversy and threaten big money interests. This time the locus of the physiological problem was not in the gut but in the brain. Unlike the relatively swift acceptance and change in medical practice brought on by the bacteria-ulcer discovery this advance is being resisted by a major corporation which has sought to defame the doctor who discovered the disease and to keep the public ignorant about its dangers.  Bennet Omalu M.D. (b. 1968) a forensic pathologist and neuropathologist while working as a pathologist in the coroners office in Pittsburg was the first to discover chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in the brains of football players. It was there that he performed an autopsy on Mike Webster a former lineman for the Pittsburg Steelers. Omalu examined Websters brain and found a large accumulation of tau protein. An abnormal level of tau causes tangles inside nerve cells in the brain which leads to major cognitive impairment. Omalu reported his findings hoping that it would alert professional and amateur football players about the severe risk associated with playing football. However Omalu did not realize that in America football is religion and an assault on playing the game was tantamount to blasphemy.  The National Football League (NFL) called for a retraction of Dr. Omalus study Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy in a National Football League Player which was published in the medical journal Neurosurgery in 2005.  Omalu was not aware that his warning about the risk of repeated head trauma and concussions which are inherent in football would be perceived as a threat to professional football and the billions of dollars invested in the game. As such his medical findings were an indictment of Americas #1 sport. Not only could his discovery affect the football industry but it could undermine the nation-wide system of youth football and school sports. As many as 2.5 million American children play tackle football.  Chris Nowinski PhD (b. 1978) a behavioral neuroscientist former Harvard football player and the co-founder and CEO of the Concussion Legacy Foundation has been working to educate the public about the devastating effects on the brain associated with the game. He has reported that football is destructive to the brain and because of this a growing number of NFL players are retiring in their prime. These enlightened players are turning down millions to lower their risk of developing brain diseases from repetitive head impacts. Understanding the danger of brain injury has prompted Nowinskis to issue a warning to parents who are unaware or knowingly negligent in allowing children as young as five to play tackle football. He says   as a neuroscientist and former college football player Im most concerned with the two-thirds of American tackle football players who are children and particularly susceptible to harm. The brain changes tremendously on the journey from birth to adulthood. Any form of trauma can change the brain and thus change the child.  The science is clearer than ever: exposure data shows children as young as 9 are getting hit in the head more than 500 times in one season of youth tackle football. That should not feel normal to us. Think of the last time outside of sports you allowed your child to get hit hard in the head 25 times in a day. Better yet when was the last time you were hit hard in the head?  The NFL and its Commissioner Roger Goodell have downplayed the overwhelming scientific evidence of CTE and maintained the status quo to order to protect the profits of the league and its owners. This is made easier because the public and most importantly parents prefer not to accept information that might diminish or endanger the hallowed sport of football. For many Americans football is life. Some parents especially fathers live vicariously through the experiences of their sons on the gridiron.  Nowinski concludes  So while the industry fights to maintain the status quo parents have to ask hard questions when their child wants to play tackle football to be like their NFL heroes. Are the benefits of youth tackle football worth risking the lifelong health of your brain? A better question  can a child make that choice?  The NFL did not like what Bennet Omalu reported about damage to the brain caused by playing football. It was a threat to the sport which could directly affect their bottom line. They feared that mothers might not let their sons grow up to be football players if they knew of the danger tackle football posed to the brain. So right after Omalu came forward with his findings the NFL worked hard to denigrate his work and even to defame his character. They pretty much ran him out of town.  Omalu survived the assault on his professionalism. He along with a growing body of scientists physicians and football players continue to speak out about the risks of playing tackle football.  In 2016 Bennet Omalu received the American Medical Associations highest honor  the Distinguished Service Award.  A bill is currently pending in New York State that would prohibit tackle football for anyone under the age of twelve.  The facts about CTE are available. It is knowledge that is not difficult to comprehend  to interpret for oneself and most of all to apply that information on behalf of the millions of children whose brains are at risk from participating in a violent sport.  Knowledge is not power unless we decide to use it.  ______________________________________  (For further reading: Concussions and Our Kids: Cantu Dr. Robert H. 2013 208 pages),political,Facebook

It appears information from the draft plan yet to be released has been leaked to media! Please read the press release  ***PRESS RELEASE*** FORMER NSW STATE MP PETER COCHRAN SNOWY RIVER CULTURAL IDENTITY CRUSHED Former NSW Member for Monaro has reported that the Snowy Mountains cultural identity is being crushed by a NPWS bureaucracy and political leadership that ignores locals and generations of experience in land management and a law passed by the NSW Parliament three years ago.  This is anarchy. Mr Cochran claimed.  NSW Minister for the Environment Matt Kean has totally ignored Legislation created and passed by the NSW Parliament and snubbed input from scientific and community panels established under the Act to provide advice on future management Mr Cochran said.  Chair of both panels are known to have been frustrated by a failure of Minister Kean to enact the Legislation and release findings of both panels prior to the Management Plan being exposed for public consultation. Information contained in the findings of both panels conflicts diametrically with concocted non-scientific evidence forwarded to both the Minister and media by the Invasive Species Council. (a fact sheet has been distributed to media by Brumby supporters).  Mr Cochran further claimed that premature release of information contained in the draft management plan released to media yesterday had corrupted an orderly scrutiny of the exposed document The Minister or Department has quite deliberately undermined a statutory process of scrutiny by the general public by attempting to influence sympathetic media.  Brumby advocate representatives have questioned the accuracy of articles recently appearing in media and scripts being prepared for a pending ABC Landline program where privileged information from the yet to be released Draft Management Plan have appeared. These quotes have been lifted from the management plan and are a direct attempt to place weight on an agenda being conducted by the Invasive Species Council. This appears to be blatant collusion between the Department and anti Brumby activists Mr Cochran concluded . 18/07/2021  Ends Peter Cochran 0417370490 (Former Member for Monaro 1988-98),political,Facebook

I have been a resident of Hightstown for 10 years and have two elementary aged children in the district. I am incredibly proud of the work our teachers do every day and hope to earn a seat on the board to support all of our kids and fight for the best possible educational environment for every single one of the students in the district.  My background is not in public service - I work in consulting and a major part of my daily life is working with multiple stakeholders vendors and clients to deliver solutions. I have been involved in crisis management in this role involved heavily in deploying solutions to problems both in remedial situations as well as in moving old processes into ""best in class"" scenarios. I want to use those skills to add to the power of our board and our district. Our district today faces many challenges that have been heightened by COVID. Ensuring our district can move into the future with the right mix of technology staff support and student support is critical now and I'm optimistic that the rapid acceleration of uptake of these new systems give us a unique window of time to advance our teachers and administrators access to new tools and support.  I am pro-teacher pro-student and I believe with my whole heart that if we give them appropriate and modern resources their incredible talents and abilities will take us to amazing heights. I believe the board should function as a ""pragmatic cheerleader"" - ensure within budget and within capacity we are providing these tools facilities and discretion to our teachers to succeed. The community the board represents is the whole community but ensuring the educational system is doing the best possible work to make an inclusive nurturing and safe environment both digitally and physically should be something the whole community can value and grow from.  I'm not a politician I'm a communicator and I think increasing communication between the board and the community is key. I will do everything within my reach if elected to find ways to increase community involvement with the board. As a parent constant frank information about the state of my children's school environment is critical. Being given opportunity to engage with leadership is critical. I would love to build on the existing channels and see what else can be done to get a more inclusive dialog going.  I'd love the opportunity to answer questions! Drop them here in the comments or message me directly or message my public candidate page (where I have other question/answer topics as well)  Thank you and have a great Friday!",political,Facebook
"This brave man has chosen to publicly speak out. Thank you for being a voice for many who go UNHEARD by our current Board of Commissioners. How would you like to have a cherished member of your family wait an hour for an ambulance when they are in dire need? Safety and security are a top concern for the voters in Lorain County. Michelle Hung and Dave Moore will be hands on addressing the real problems we face at our County 911. The fact that current Commissioners were playing ""Facebook Footsie"" while an outage was occurring is disgraceful. They should be working to fix these and many problems listed below not scrolling Facebook. End it. Vote Hung and Moore on November 3rd.  Please share.  Dear 911 commissioners lorain county police fire and ems departments  Due to multiple issues at 911 I am resigning. Previously when people leave or quit 911 the truth is not told as to why they are leaving. I want to make it very clear that I am leaving 911 because of the way it is managed the hostile work environment the way we are treated the lack of direction and leadership and the refusal to acknowledge the actual issues by management the union and county administration. There is no accountability by management to address the numerous complaints or issues by the employees and the agencies we serve. I requested fmla because of the multiple issues at 911 and how its taking its toll on me physically mentally and emotionally. It obviously got denied and they requested medical certification. Even if I was granted fmla the core issues at hand still go unaddressed. They are now aware of the multiple issues because they had to read it to deny my fmla. Yet they still refuse to acknowledge or believe there are any issues to be addressed. I have worked in law enforcement since 2002. I am well aware of the hours and schedules that comes with the job. It is hazardous to operate and work like we do at 911. Weeks or months without days off. The Contract is manipulated to force you in on your days off for coverage. Year after year people working the equivalent of 365 days in overtime. Last year I roughly worked the equivalent of 361 days. In the past 12 months I have worked the equivalent of 365 days. This year I already have 560 hours of overtime which is up 41% from last July. Until recently if you took the staff we had and filled the vacant shifts on days and nights there literally would not have been an afternoon shift. I understand on paper if you put vacant shifts on days and nights and staff some of the afternoon shift it does not look as bad as actually not having an afternoon shift. Roughly so far this year 19 people have worked 7695 hrs of overtime with 7 of those people having over 500 hrs and two over 700 hrs of overtime...its only the middle of July with over 5 months to go. Since the merger of lcso and 911 I have witnessed a lack of urgency to fully staff this place and properly train people. This I feel is hazardous for all involved us working this much you responding to calls and the citizens that need help. When i crossed trained for fire/ems during the merger my training was shortened to 12 weeks since I knew the county and system. Now we handle more and trainees get 9 weeks of fire/ems. 9 weeks of training for the police side of things. Yes some people that are currently employed at 911 should not have made it out of training per their trainer stating they were a liability. The majority of the employees want to do a good job. Unfortunately 911 doesnt provide people with training for success and cuts corners just to staff the place. Since I have been at 911 (2011) the employees continue to say they need actual certified training officer and an actual training program designed for success. Most of the trainees quit during training because of the way management allows them to be treated by their trainers. Same complaints over and over against the same specific employees and I bet you there is no documentation of it. Multiple complaints of bullying and harassment and nothing is done. Even sexual harassment complaints were blown off. For years I have stated that due to the work environment I thought someone would end up trying some act of self harm and again no one cares. All the numerous letters to the county administrator and commissioners from multiple people no once have they took the time to speak to employees and hear the truth and reality of 911. I dont know if they have ignored issues for so long that if they did finally acknowledge them that there will be some negligence and liability on their end. Not sure where the county is getting their information that 911 is perfect and flawless as from what I hear departments cant get anywhere when they do have issues that need addressed. I am sure its blamed on the employees and not the direction or leadership of 911. I am sure that the employees are rarely if ever spoken too about issues. I know I have personally asked the director to sit with me for 1 hour because I felt I was struggling not doing well I wanted help and guidance to do a better job and never got that hour to make sure I was doing things well. We have a quality control supervisor who just listens to our phone calls radio traffic personal conversations (via cameras and microphones above every position) and not once has anyone been told what they can do differently or better. They do seem to find mistakes and lie about a complaint from a department and when fact checked with the department/responders they say that they never complained. When asked to see the complaint they dont know if was an email conversation cad message or phone call so you can hear what the exact complaint was and from who. In operations it appears from the employees end management wont tell the multiple 30 plus agencies we dispatch for no thus everyone gets what they want creating multiple failure points because it is impossible to keep track of what every department wants and how they want it done. You have 2 911 call takers handling all 911 calls for lorain county whether its a transfer to another agency or something they have to handle and tone out departments for. If its an ems call that they have to handle and give pre-arrival instructions the average call probably takes about 3 min. Roughly from January 1st 2019 to August 31st I can find a documented 152962 calls.(with 45058 of those being outgoing). If you divide that number by 8 to get an average and multiply it by 12 to get an idea of call volume thats over 229000 a year. In the period from January 1st to august 31st there were 243 days and 107904 incoming calls. That is an average of 444 calls coming into 911 daily in some way that need attention and time to handle. I know people are not happy with the fire dispatchers frequently but you have to realize you have 1 person talking on 8 different radio channels that handle 24 departments. So if you have multiple departments talking at once or talking to/toning one department which mutes the other channels while departments are calling you can see that it is easy for things to not flow smoothly. So I understand things may not be portrayed to you in a truthful manner and are told we can do things multiple different ways for multiple departments but if you are honest with yourself you know that we cant cater to everyones specific needs and uniformity is needed. There are no formal policies and procedures here. We have begged the union to due something and are told to get that negotiated into our next contract. Im sure if 911 was pressed to see their policies they may have something to say here we have those but if you took those to the employees we would say that we have never seen that. We have call guides and memos used as policies. No employee here could tell you on the spot what policy 2.2 is or where to look it up to find out. I would say anything told to you needs to be fact checked and verified due to the numerous lies I have witnessed and experienced. I know that your complaints fall on deaf ears ours do too. We only have one supervisor that I have seen do anything and that is russ. Since russ is the only one that does anything and given everything to do if it doesnt work or is wrong they blame him. Last Friday we had a storm roll in. we got slammed in here. The supervisor on duty just sat in his office. Not once to come out and help or guide us. Didnt come out of his office to make sure we werent missing calls/radio traffic. Didnt offer to help call utilities. I think at one point it got so loud and busy he just shut his door and continued to stay in his office. This can all be verified by the numerous cameras and microphones. Im willing to be that if someone wanted to see this for themselves that the recording system was down. I literally told the commissioners and county administrator to come see this for themselves. Im sure if questions the excuse would be its not his job or he was monitoring and saw that we had it under control. Ive been threated by management (which off course no one present remembers or heard the threat) and I had the police called on me at 911. Read those reports if you want. Even the people that dont like me for personal reasons cant and havent said that Im not good at my job. I just cant deal with the environment conditions and the way we are treated anymore. Nothing will ever change so I dont know what else to do beside quit before I become depressed. I cant just be employed here anymore knowing how many people are at risk. Recent discoveries have provided information of tampering with records to maintain emergency medical dispatch certification and provide aid. Mandatory recertification hours to maintain certification were not provided to us and fraudulently submitted. In turn Im not sure where the liability would fall if sued in a wrongful death case. Im guessing that it would be the individual dispatchers to take the fall so the county again is not responsible/liable for anything. This fraudulently obtained emd certification also puts us out of compliance with state standards. I reported the tampering with records to both the union and commissioners and no response. Its not fair that I am forced to quit a job that I actually like due to the liability placed on me since the agency is mismanaged. For my own health and well-being I have no other options but to quit. Please share this with people in the department as I have made many friends in the past 18 years so they know the truth and hear my reasons why I have to leave. I attached my email if anyone ever wants to reach out and see what this new journeys in life holds for me. Most people I am close to have my phone number but if you dont just email you and I will send it. I was the last Lorain County Sheriffs office dispatcher left. No dispatcher dispatching for LCSO now will have actually work for the Sheriff and wore that uniform. Those I worked with there are and always be considered family  Take care lorain county Josh liles  Also I couldnt any acknowledgement from the county administration 911 director or my union to personal hand my resignation letter to and have a conversation with. Which just proves why I had to leave. No one cares nothing will change",political,Facebook

"Friends  the Leesburg Patch asked all candidates to respond to the same questions and they also allowed candidates to skip questions and give no response. The following are the questions I responded to and my opponent decided not to answer.  My opponent also falsely states that I have no active campaign and that I signed a pledge not to run. The pledge I signed was contingent upon a fair and open endorsement process which it was not and the approval of my membership in the Loudoun County Democratic Committee which was rejected. I received a refund of my membership fee which removed me from all previous obligations to this organization.  1. Do you support Black Lives Matter and what are your thoughts on the demonstrations held since the death of George Floyd and the shooting of Jacob Blake?  I started Citizens for a Better Leesburg as a Facebook Community and in May after the George Floyd murder and I organized what turned out to be the largest Loudoun County peaceful demonstration of citizen engagement. this event showcased the peaceful outrage and show of sympathy for the Floyd family. I am not afraid to use my leadership platform to help our diverse communities as they wrestle with local and national issues that we cannot ignore. I have always supported the constitutional rights and protections for all American Citizens. And when at times the arbitrary and disproportionate treatment of Americans of African descent results in violence and death it is time to speak out and that's what the over 2500 people who came to Leesburg on May 31st wanted us to hear Black Lives Matter and no more. They came as individuals as families with children in strollers they came as friends and school communities they came to take a stand against law enforcement violence taking the lives of black men and women.  2. What are your thoughts on the campaign to ""defund"" the police? In Leesburg we have been historically underfunded the police department because of partisan fears of raising taxes. I am leading the initiative with members of our community to have an open conversation with the Chief of Police related to some of the national issues and local concerns. As our Town has grown we are also experiencing the challenges of paying for additional police and improving our safety and emergency response operations. I believe that it is time for us to be open to recommendations about what law enforcement services we need and how to pay for them. Moving forward the culture and impact of working with our law enforcement officers in our town will look and feel different than in other communities and our citizens should have a role in the process. The funding for law enforcement services will and should continue. It is my hope to engage our community to work with law enforcement to review our policies and explore the opportunities for citizen involvement and building safe communities for all.  3. What are your thoughts on the state and national response to the coronavirus pandemic? Do you favor such measures as limiting operation of non-essential businesses or restricting indoor/outdoor dining? And do you favor a nationwide mask mandate? We are in state of national emergency and the impacts have been devastating on the tremendous loss of life and changes to our daily way of life. I believe in the science and the recommendations to keep the virus under control. I believe that the statewide restrictions has a disproportionate impact on each community but I support the restrictions and don't see them as limiting our freedoms. I believe in mask wearing hand sanitizing and social distancing to protect ourselves others family and friends. Mask wearing is the only way we will ever get back to the freedom of not wearing a mask until we get the full impact of a vaccine. My children and grandchildren have had limited our exposure to each other. My wife and I have experienced the virtual HS graduation of a grandson and missed birthdays of aging parents. Our unity as a community must be focused on doing all that we can.  4. What are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post? I have the proven leadership and financial experience that is critically necessary at this time. I have the ability to develop partnerships without regards to political party affiliation and use all of our common strengths to create a working environment of respect. I am a passionate community organizer who volunteers and works with many of our diverse community organizations and can engage them as important stakeholders. I believe that job accountability is important as our community make the important decision about to who to vote for as Mayor. I am not leaning on political party support or the usual marketing techniques to get your attention or your vote. I continually inform the community about the decisions I make and I am not afraid to object on issues where I believe don't serve the best interests of our community. I have made strong efforts to work in a nonpartisan fashion and will continue to be inclusive of all voices in our community. I know how to lead difficult conversations and resolve complex problems.  5. If you are a challenger in what way has the current board or officeholder failed the community (or district or constituency) I am running for Mayor of Leesburg because the challenges that face our community require new leadership that has the ability and the experience to step outside of the partisan circle to lead conversations on important topics such as the economic recovery plan for the town and our small businesses. The impacts of COVID-19 are a critical top priority that must be addressed. It is estimated that we will lose 25% of our current small businesses. I plan to lead the Council in the development of a five- year recovery plan to prioritize the budget impacts and take action on solutions to provide services to our residents and our small businesses. The business community involvement in this plan is critical to the financial success of the town and provide for new innovative concepts to stimulate small business growth. My educational background and professional leadership roles have given me the experience that is critically necessary to support the challenges facing the town. In my four years on Council I have developed partnerships without regards to political party affiliation and as a leader I know how to use all of our common strengths to work towards serving all in our town. I am a principled leader that will work with all elected members of the Town Council and will assure you that all members of our community will be treated with fairness and respect. I believe in people over politics and pledge to always put the best interest of our town first.  6. What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job? I have built many business partnerships that have delivered economic and social value for public and private institutions and organizations. I have worked with diverse communities to help organize programs and presentations that add value to their voices. I spoken in front of public and private forums in the U.S. and in five foreign countries. I can handle the political pressure and remain true to my integrity and commitment to serve the town. I have had to make difficult business decisions about outsourcing jobs affecting the lives of thousands of food service workers and I was able to achieve an innovative outcome that was applauded by the labor unions representing the workers. We outsourced management and kept the workers as university employees. I have learned that many things are possible with the right team and an open mind to seek creative solutions.  7. What are your views on fiscal policy government spending and the use of taxpayer dollars in the office you are seeking? The Council has an important oversight responsibility to ensure that public funds and spent appropriately and that the budget priorities reflect a spending plan that support services and programs to benefit the entire community and keep tax rates that maintain an affordable quality of life for all in our community. The new council must prepare itself to quickly learn about the fiscal challenges and the fiscal obligations that have been built into the current budget that have been mostly covered by residential and business tax revenues. I will propose additional council budget orientation sessions that will focus on the learning about the fiscal deficit and potential solutions that might involve reductions in staff and/or services. This fiscal deficit cannot be resolved by increasing taxes on an already fiscally stressed community. Additional revenue support will be hard to find and no new support will be coming from the county or the state and we will need to have serious conversations with the town's financial advisers about how to best use reserve funds while we are in the recovery period.  8. What else would you like voters to know about yourself and your positions? I will bring a non-adversarial approach to the Town Council and seek to respect all council members as we debate and make important town decisions. I intend to get support for a planning retreat with the town staff and our commision leadership so that we can all set agendas that reflect the town priorities. I love Leesburg and the many great communities that we have. I want our town to reflect our strengths and a positive future as we move forward in uncertain fiscal times. I have the professional business and leadership experience to move us forward.  Time to make a change in leadership for the future of Leesburg is now.",political,Facebook

The Putnam County Sentinel asked 3 questions of each judicial candidate. Here are my answers:  1. What qualifications do you bring to the position of Common Pleas Court Juvenile/Probate Judge?  Experience. I have been Putnam Countys Probate/Juvenile Judge since 2011. Since then I have handled nearly 10000 probate/juvenile cases.  Innovation. I have established programs to benefit juvenile probationers i.e. Make the Grade program Mock Interview program. I worked with Crime Victim Services to develop the CASA program for use in child custody cases. I co-operated with former Judge Randall Basinger to bring the pro se clinic to Putnam County to assist those who appear in court without counsel.  Co-operation. I meet annually with the County Schools Superintendents and Principals to address issues we share and to support them in providing the best learning environment possible. I through my probation department assumed responsibility for the Schools truancy program after the ESC lost funding for its truancy officer. I became certified to act as Municipal Court Judge saving the County thousands of dollars.  Outreach. I have given presentations to students regarding the misuse of alcohol the dangers of opioid abuse and the potential consequences of inappropriate use of phones and social media.  Experience. My time as Judge has acquainted me with the challenges the Court faces and makes me the most qualified candidate to address them.  2. Should politics/party affiliation play a role in the election of a judge? Please explain your position.  The Columbus Bar Association says this about judicial elections: Ohios judicial elections are non-partisan. Due to the non-partisan nature of a judges role Ohio law does not permit the identification of political party on the ballot for judicial candidates.  This was more succinctly stated by a supporter who said A judges allegiance should be to the law not a political party! I agree wholeheartedly.  A judges responsibility is to apply the facts given to enacted law and to do so without bias or partisan concerns. Partisan politics have never played a role in my actions as a Judge. I have hired several employees since I became Judge in 2011 I have never asked an interviewee his/her party affiliation. I wanted the best candidate for the job the person who could best handle the duties and responsibilities of the position.  I believe that most of Putnam County agrees and having already elected me to this position both in 2012 and 2014 will vote for the candidate they believe most qualified to perform the duties and accept the responsibilities of Judge of the Putnam County Probate/Juvenile Court.  3. What do you perceive as the most significant challenges related to the position of Juvenile/Probate Court Judge? I see two significant challenges facing the Court I expect that they will ultimately intertwine.  The first is the significant increase in the number and severity of Abuse Neglect Dependency cases. Many of these cases unfortunately result in the permanent removal of children from their parents care and custody. This upsurge is the clear result of the increase of drug use and abuse within the County.  The second is the lack of resources available to care for children with significant mental psychological and emotional disorders; both in financial expenditures and available facilities. It is not uncommon for placement of a juvenile in one of these facilities to cost as much as $400/day and even the least expensive exceed $200/day. Many of these placements last for years.  Beyond the financial cost some children as a result of their multi diagnosis are virtually unplaceable. In one case only one facility east of the Mississippi even responded to our placement inquiry. As the children who are suffering abuse and being removed from their homes mature they will further stress the finite resources available. My experience in these cases will prove invaluable in maximizing these resources.

ECONOMIC RECOVERY POST-COVID The solutions of economic recovery are lying right under our noses with knowledge expertise technology and research all present right here in Maine. The solutions all lead straight back to impeccable environmental stewardship. At our own flagship university the University of Maine the Advanced Structures and Composites Center has engineered composite floating offshore wind turbine hulls which could produce 156 gigawatts of energy per year within 10 years -- more than $20 million of annual revenue at today's market value free energy to Maine residents (through tax rebates or possibly a dividend disbursement similar to the Alaska Permanent Fund) and thousands of new jobs. A Katahdin North Woods National Park would result in more than $100 million per year injected into Maine's economy and up to 6000 new jobs in the first 10 years 10000 in the first 20. In a post-Covid-19 world the environment will be an even greater tourism and recreation attraction than ever before.

Lets talk about PLASTIC. Please (for your own good!) DO NOT leave plastic water bottles in a hot car - the chemicals from the plastic will leech into the water and then you drink them = not good! Please DO get yourself a REUSEABLE WATER BOTTLE. It is worth investing in a good one - why? because they last!!! Imagine for a minute all the money you could save by simply refilling your bottle over and over rather than dropping $1-5 on a ONE-TIME USE bottle every time you get thirsty?! Also because you are helping the environment with each sip from your bottle!!!! Now that is good!!!  Plastic is horrible for our environment. And for our INTERNAL environment - it can interfere with your hormones! YIKES! And on that note please DO NOT ever heat up your food in the microwave in a plastic container - again the chemicals go right in to the food that you are about to eat!!! Please DO use glass storage containers to store and heat up food - why? they last much longer than plastic and are SO MUCH BETTER FOR YOU (AND THE ENVIRONMENT)!

"MODERN MONETARY THEORY: MISREPRESENTED ONCE AGAIN  Recently on a Bloomberg financial podcast an executive level employee at J.P. Morgan stated he did not believe in Modern Monetary Theory (MMT). MMT is a controversial monetary theory which offers a description of monetary operations which challenge orthodox economic and financial thinking. Within current MMT reasoning there is a belief there is room for fiscal expansion which when coordinated with the Nation's central bank--the Federal Reserve (FED) will enable public investment in human and physical capital i.e. infrastructure without inflationary consequences. The J.P. Morgan executive argued that in order for MMT to succeed that it would also have to fail: that to accumulate the debt which he implies is acceptable to MMT for public investment then even if the investment proved good for the economy the accumulated debt would then tank the economy.  It was the strangest comment that one could expect from an investment banker and it also misrepresented MMT views. First from an investment banker perspective it is strange to state that debt issuance condemns an institution to failure. Bankers afterall are peddlers of private sector debt issued on the belief that the gains from private investment will generally exceed the cost of capital. Government debt issued in order to facilitate productive investment: physical and human likewise has the potential to create long term gains in the economy which exceed the cost of capital. So it was strange to hear an investment banker ignore the growth potential associated with public debt issuance which finances physical and human capital investment: the type of investment promoted within the MMT framework.  The MMT public sector investment portfolio would include such things as green energy investment in education and most importantly a federal job guarantee program which would offer a job to anyone who seeks a job at a livable wage with health and child care benefits--a near full employment program.  A legitimate concern here should not be the level of debt so long as the associated funds are directed into productive investment but the concern should be the potential inflationary impact of large scale investment which creates individual earnings not yet matched by an increase in the provision of consumer goods and services. The temporary mismatch between increased earnings from new investment and the availability of goods and services may create short to medium term inflationary pressures in these consumer markets. One market concern undoubtedly is the belief that once inflation begins it feeds on itself into an upward spiral of increased inflationary pressure which can only be resolved through monetary and fiscal tightenings i.e. an induced recession.  It is not clear to me whether MMT has adequately addressed the short term inflationary impact of broad public infrastructure investment. MMT definitely recognizes that Federal spending is limited by potential inflationary effects of Federal spending and it seems they differ from the broader market participants in their view of the size and scope of available resources which can be put to work before real resource restraints create inflationary pressure. In other words it seems that MMT believes there currently exists greater slack in the economy than the broader market participants believe and it also seems that MMT believes that increased productive capacity which meets consumer demand can come online rather quickly in order to thwart these inflationary pressures. The latter view is undoubtedly challenged in a trade restricted environment.  It appears that MMT takes the long view and the bigger point is that green energy will eventually be a more efficient source of energy while high tech education combined with liberal arts training will make us both more productive and better citizens. The federal jobs programs will assist in the development of work skills which will further enhance national productivity. Debt used to finance such activity would be a very good use of debt and will not inflict damage on the national economy but rather will enhance long term growth in a noninflationary manner.  Much of the above discussion is premised on a misrepresentation of the MMT view on public debt. The J.P. Morgan Executive's view is premised on the idea that Federal deficit spending must be funded with debt. This is not the MMT view. Federal debt issuance is a policy option not a requirement for deficit spending.  The MMT view is that a sovereign monetary authority such as the U.S. which creates its own free floating currency creates money when it spends and destroys money through taxation and borrowing. Money creation and money destruction need not be equal. Spending need not be fully funded but only 'funded' to an extent and in a manner which prevents inflation in the goods services and asset markets. In other words deficit spending need not be funded with debt: the money for deficit spending is created through the act of spending. An equivalent debt issuance merely destroys an equal amount of money thereby neutralizing any inflationary impact of the deficit spending. Debt issuance money destruction is a mere tool for inflation control and for other convenient purposes i.e. private portfolio investment stability store of value interest rate targeting . . . .  Furthermore the Executive's narrative ignored debt management techniques discussed elsewhere on this Page (""Federal Debt Revisited"" scroll 5 essays down) such as debt extinguishment the Platinum coin idea which grew out of the 2011 budget ceiling crisis taxation of the well-off rather than borrowing from the well-off and Federal Reserve perpetual holdings of Treasury debt on its balance sheet--which is costless to the U.S. taxpayer. The brief discussion of MMT was yet another false representation of MMT views.  Generally it is wise to dismiss about 85% of corporate reporting on MMT views. Most commentators have not seriously examined MMT; others are in no mood to change the status quo. Large capital interests in the private sector simply do not want to concede additional space to the public sector regardless of the long term growth potential associated with public sector investment.  Undoubtedly the Nation's long term productivity potential would be greatly enhanced by the above public sector investments. But in the long run the current investment class won't be here. Perhaps this is part of the problem. The other part lies in the short term investment horizon of private sector firms responding to investor demands for short term profits which overall does not align with the long term investment objectives of the Federal government.

Copy and pasted from a constituent. Some of the economic accomplishments have been impacted by COVID.

News to Share... I received this TCPalm Letter to the Editor submitted by Don Defenthaler who worked in the Martin County Property Appraiser's office for many years. His letter demonstrates a biased culture that permeates through the office and highlights the need for a fresh perspective and new leadership built on integrity and a strong commitment to treating all employees with respect and trust.  Fields not fit for Property Appraiser Job  As a state-certified real estate appraiser I worked for the Martin County Property Appraisers Office as Director of Appraisal Services for 8 years.  Unfortunately I made the mistake of mentioning I would be interested in running for Property Appraiser. Big mistake!  I was praised by the Property Appraiser for formulas and procedures I developed the quality of my work and accomplishments but from that point forward I felt like I had a target on my back.  Jenny Fields worked in customer service and as manager of data input. She was promoted to Assistant Director without the experience necessary. Apparently there was a plan in place for Fields to take over the Property Appraiser position. She scrutinized criticized and controlled the work of staff members in all departments.  Her leadership style created a toxic work environment with employees feeling stressed overworked and even bullied as was my experience.  Fields did not understand appraisal methodology. She states she has taken numerous appraisal courses but cites only two Department of Revenue appraisal courses (which take four days to complete). She has eight days of coursework under her belt?  Fields came to me with valuation questions and questioned my 30-years of expertise regarding my decision to revalue a property and was adamant that the property should be valued her way. I made it clear I would never intentionally do anything to artificially increase or decrease the value of a property for any reason.  As a four-term City Commissioner Kelli Glass Leighton displays integrity and genuine concern for our community. Glass Leighton has experience creating a work culture of mutual trust listening being well-informed efficiency in operations communication transparency and employee appreciation.  Kelli Glass Leighton is a proven leader. She has my vote for Martin County Property Appraiser.  Don Defenthaler,political,Facebook

With the fishing season in full swing B. Scott Ekas shares a few simple steps for proper catch and release.  The practice of catch and release fishing has gained popularity among recreational anglers throughout the United States. While harvesting fish for consumption is still widely accepted and even encouraged releasing fish after taking a few photos and measurements helps our fish to live longer and grow larger. If you choose to catch and release focusing on a few fundamentals can greatly reduce post-release mortality. As you troll out on your next fishing expedition consider using barbless hooks minimize fight times and handle fish with wet hands.  Barbed hooks are very good at securing fish especially during a fight when they jump and create slack in the line. While barbs effectively anchor into the mouths of fish they can cause significant wounds and increase mortality. For those interested in releasing fish consider using barbless hooks or use needle nose pliers to pinch down the barbs on your existing lures.  Fighting fish also known as playing fish is a quintessential part of fishing. Anyone whos spent time fishing can attest to the thrill of a fish gaining the upper hand and vehemently swimming away dragging line from the spool. While thrilling extensively playing fish exhausts and stresses them increasing the likelihood theyll die. If youre going to release fish its good practice to quickly reel them in take a photo and return them to the water.  Once caught the way fish are handled can help their survival. Fish generate and are covered with a secretion that serves several purposes. Their slime acts as a natural shield which protects them from infection. Without this coating fish are much more susceptible to bacteria and organisms which can be fatal. In addition this coating facilitates swimming as it reduces turbulence and drag. Wetting your hands prior to handling fish will help to keep their protective coating intact.  Game fish are a wonderful asset in our rivers lakes and streams. Muskellunge pike bass and catfish can live for years while enduring a variety of water temperatures and conditions. As stewards of this wonderful environment its our duty to ensure our game fish populations are healthy and abundant for future generations.  Whether youre catching fish for dinner or to release please be safe have fun and good luck!  B. Scott Ekas is a lifelong resident of Saxonburg PA. He is a graduate of Slippery Rock University Robert Morris College and Point Park University. As an avid outdoorsman Scott enjoys a variety of activities including hunting fishing hiking and camping.,political,Facebook
Monday Musing  I was speaking with a friend I respect very much the other day. We were discussing the Sheriffs race. He had a unique observation. He said the job of a Sheriff is very much like a business owner. I gave that some thought and I have to agree. As Sheriff I will be the face of the Macon County Law Enforcement. I will be expected to make the big decisions in reference to how the department will progress. I will be the one who takes responsibility when one of my employees makes a mistake. I will make the decisions on who we hire and sadly who we fire. I will make the decisions on how to best utilize our assets to further our mission. I will be the one who puts the very best people I can find into the position they are best suited for. Especially when it comes to the leadership positions. Like President Harry Truman once said The buck stops here.  So as I look at my lifes experiences I try to find those qualities in me and where I was able to exercise them. They began when I was a teenager and President of my Junior Achievement group for two years. I learned about making a product sales and the like. Then also as a teenager I worked at a Boy Scout camp for a summer and learned independence and teamwork. I then learned responsibility as a young man when I got married. I had to learn I was not the most important person in the world as my family grew. They were. When I joined the Navy I learned leadership at every level. I had some great leaders teaching me by example. Something I carry with me today. As a Chief in the Navy I learned that you take care of those in your charge and they will walk through the gates of hell for you. I learned about placing the most qualified personnel into the jobs they are best suited for. I also learned about work ethic and thinking outside the box to get the job done. When I worked for the grocery chain Publix I learned about customer service; making our customers happy meant they kept coming back and shopping our store. Then I began my career as a law enforcement officer. There I learned the meaning of service. I learned about all sorts of people and how regardless of who or what they were I was there to ensure their safety. I further learned about leadership and working with people. I learned that people are people and they all have a right to a safe and happy living environment.  Now this brings me to the job of Sheriff. I believe that a Sheriff doesnt necessarily have to jump out of the car and chase bad guys. He isnt responsible for advising the suspects of their Miranda rights or even ensuring that there is proper probable cause in the arrest. He needs to administer the department. He needs to ensure his employees are happy well taken care of well trained and have all the tools they need to execute their duties. What is the icing on the cake is a Sheriff who has all of these qualities and can recognize when the details of the job are not being completed correctly. A Sheriff who can look at a particularly tough situation and can recommend a tactic or process that hasnt been tried before. A Sheriff who knows the job inside and out.  I am that person who has all of those traits and qualifications. I am the best candidate to move our Macon County Sheriffs Office into the next phase. I have been leadership tested and experience proven!,political,Facebook
As a 4 decade resident of Beavercreek I can hardly explain what this community means to me. Its built me. The schools the neighbors the teachers the experiences the mentors the environment.  My parents chose to move here from Dayton for a better opportunity for their children. Fast forward 43 years now my sister and I are settled established and at the stage of worrying about what the future looks like for our parents.  On fixed incomes starting to face significant health challenges struggling with home upkeep AND still subsidizing contributions from employed residents and non-residents through their property taxes while facing even more levies going forward. Its not just my parents I know 100s of others who are in the same boat.  Why do we continue to do this? Why are we taxing my parents and others out of their homes? They helped to build this community over the past 43 years.  Why are we throwing millions away to neighboring communities each year? Dayton Xenia Kettering etc. love the extra money that is made here and shipped back to them from non-resident earnings.  Why are the locally employed trying so hard to break down this community and sidestep local Income Tax contributions needed to run this City reinforce the infrastructure and protect our aging population?  I hear lots about Base-related employment. The Beavercreek community has embraced this population with open arms for decades on end. I see what those people earn. Why cant they contribute locally?  I hear lots about fiscal responsibility. What significant missteps has the City made? They operate on a shoestring budget and service a massive operation. If it were that bad here many of those complaining frankly would not be here.  I dont get many things in life and this happens to be another one of them. Without community we are nothing.  I ask that you support issue 1 and protect the future of the Beavercreek community because its the right thing to do!  -Issue 1 Supporter  #BFFC #YesOnIssue1,political,Facebook
Good morning everyone! Here is a good article about the property value increase.  Copied from the Newnan Times Herald. Saturday July 25 2020  LOCAL  County to take 'rollback' millage rate  BYSARAHFAYCAMPBELL  sarah@newnan.com  The Coweta County Commission will be adopting the rollback millage rate for property taxes or possibly something even lower. But exactly what that millage rate will be is yet to be determined.  The rollback rate is the property tax millage rate that will bring in the same amount of revenue on existing properties as last year's millage rate did.  A rollback rate is lower than the previous year's millage rate if property values have increased.  Under state law if local governments plan to adopt a millage rate higher than the rollback rate it's a tax increase ? even if the millage rate is staying the same or going down.  If a tax increase is proposed there must be three public hearings before the vote.  If a governing body plans to adopt the rollback rate one public hearing is required.  The public hearing will be Aug. 18 at 6 p.m. and will be held during the regularly -scheduled commission meeting. The millage rate will be set later during that meeting.  With the current economic impact of COVID-19 'we think it is incumbent on the board and staff to present something very favorable on behalf of the taxpayers' County Administrator Michael Fouts said after Tuesday night's meeting. 'And we're trying to do that.'  Coweta's tax digest ? the total value of all taxable property in the county ? is up significantly following a countywide revaluation of residential and agricultural properties.  Though the assessment notices property owners received in the mail show an estimated tax increase no local government has set its millage rate yet.  The overall digest is up 17 percent though 6 to 8 percent of that is new construction Mike Marchese Coweta chief appraiser said last month.  Many Cowetans saw dramatic increases in their property value particularly land value with some seeing increases of hundreds of thousands of dollars. Other residents saw more modest increases and a few saw property values decrease.  Many Coweta residents have submitted appeals of their new property tax assessments. The appeal deadline is Aug. 10.  The annual property tax assessment and the digest are based on the value of property on Jan. 1 of each year by law.  'A lot of people are saying how ow dare the board adopt the rate given the environment?'' Fouts said referring to the economic impact of COVID-19.  But the new assessment values don't reflect COVID-19 because they are as of Jan. 1.  Fouts said county staff received a preliminary digest late Friday.  The county always has to set a millage rate based on a preliminary digest before all appeals are completed. But this year there are a lot more appeals than normal.  Despite that  'we've run the numbers and feel confident in the rollback number' Fouts said following Tuesday night's commission meeting.  'If we are able to dial it back even more that is our goal.'

About Me  For those who dont know me I want to share a little more about myself and how I became part of the Wimberley community.  I was born and raised in Connecticut with two sisters and a brother. Mom came from Louisiana; Dad from Florida. I graduated early from high school to embark on an adventure as an exchange student in Copenhagen Denmark. There I learned a new language and adapted to a new culture. Returning to North America I began my undergraduate education at McGill University a public institution in Montreal Quebec where I majored in history.  In June 1979 I skipped my graduation to get married. My then-husband Pandelis a geophysicist/geologist and I were blessed and cursed to spend the early years of our marriage relocating several times with the oil business while raising two small children.  We started in Calgary followed by Houston Toronto Denver where I earned a Masters degree in History and then back to Houston. In 1987 with a 7-year-old and 4-week old baby we moved to Cairo Egypt for a five-year expat assignment with AMOCO. While there I had the opportunity to obtain a second Masters degree and to teach in the English Language Institute at the American University in Cairo. A blessing of our time in Egypt was our proximity to Greece my husbands homeland. Our children were able to spend quality time with their Yia Yia and Papou as well as the extended family absorb their Greek culture and learn the Greek language. In 1992 repatriated to Houston I got my first job in public education at Stratford High School in Spring Branch ISD teaching English World Geography and U.S. History. I also coached distance runners on the boys and girls JV and Varsity cross-country and track teams.  During those early years our son Petros began coming to Rancho El Cima in the summer for Boy Scout camp which is how I came to know Wimberley. After frequent visits here over the years in 2009 I bought my home in Paradise Hills and joined the Transfiguration Greek Orthodox Church in Austin. In 2018 after rebuilding my Houston condo after the flooding caused by Hurricane Harvey and the opening of the dams I retired from 26 years in public education. I relocated to Wimberley full time and joined two business partners to open a small business. Validate ME LLC provides international transcript evaluations for high school students enrolling in U.S. schools and American students returning home from study abroad to public private and charter high schools.  Though Pandelis and I are divorced we remain friends and enjoy family gatherings together with our children and grandchildren. Our son Petros daughter-in-law Christina and their children Sophia 10 Gabriel 6 and Marina 4 live in Houston. Like his dad Petros is a geologist working in the oil industry for Chevron. Christina teaches religious studies at the Annunciation Orthodox School which all three grandchildren attend.  Our daughter Theodosia (Josie) taught English for 7 years at South High School in Denver. With a Masters degree from Harvard in International Education Policy she now develops curriculum for the Norwegian Refugee Council in Washington D.C.  Since the onset of the Coronavirus last Spring all of us have had to adapt and work through the challenges. Watching school systems prepare to reopen in safe and healthy ways when Place 6 came up for election my first thought was that this was an area where I could be of service to our community.  Id like to bring my skillset and experience to help support teachers and staff get students back on track academically socially and emotionally in a challenging environment.  Throughout my career I have approached each position I held as a servant leader. In this capacity I am running for WISD Board of Trustees Place 6.,political,Facebook
18 August 2020  Dear Dr. Adams  Like many members of the Connetquot community I have read your plan for reopening schools. I witnessed firsthand the discussions regarding reopening in September between District and union leadership. I appreciate the enormous task of creating a plan such as this for a district of any size in a year where many including you have experienced trauma and illness. I am in the unique position of having worked in a live television setting prior to becoming a teacher and I have taught via livestream at the university level. And despite my experience with creating resources to deliver high-quality instruction online and using technology to work in a live video environment to clearly get my point across I have questions.  First why did you announce the reopening plan to the Connetquot community and not share it with your instructional staff? Community members received the plan via email but our staff did not. I found out about your plan via a text message from a teacher who is a Connetquot parent otherwise I would have not known the plan was released.  How am I to teach to cohorts of students in person and via livestream in a responsible responsive flexible and intuitive manner?  How do I teach my students effectively if the Chromebooks that the District ordered do not arrive until sometime mid-Fall?  How do I achieve success in employing the variety of accommodations of my classified students some of whom I may never meet in person?  At what point in my teaching day would you suggest I respond to the hundreds of emails I may receive as was the case when we conducted remote instruction last Spring?  How am I to conduct laboratory investigations in a manner where the wonder is not lost since many students will watch a livestream of what could have been an excellent inquiry experience?  What method would you suggest is best to use to assess students both in person and virtually simultaneously and securely?  Is the District securing enough personal protective equipment for students to use in a laboratory setting if they are appropriately distanced?  Are we also wearing microphones so we can be heard by all in person and via livestream?  Am I able to conduct laboratory investigations outside with the students who are in school? Is the webcam portable?  Who is responsible for disinfecting the laboratory equipment after use?  Will the webcams arrive and be installed in time for teachers to practice with before the students begin on September 10th? If not what is the plan and how will the Connetquot community be notified?  Will there be a delay in the broadcasting of the livestream as is the case with all television network broadcasts from the news to sporting events and beyond?  How do I maintain the privacy of my students virtually and in person and for myself in the event that someone purposefully takes a screenshot or video recording of the livestream?  How do I protect myself from the rampant social media criticism that occurs from members within and beyond the Connetquot community? Stress over the very real possibility of people attempting character assassination of our incredible teachers has left me sleepless for more than a few nights.  What happens when technology issues occur and we cannot livestream? With students in the classroom I cannot be expected to pivot a lesson online to work asynchronously and maintain learning with my students in class.  There has been much focus on the hybrid plan for reopening schools. Has there been any thought as to what the plan will look like when schools have to close for any amount of time short- or long-term?  Lastly but with no less significance when will teachers receive professional development during the work week or during the school year as we are being asked to do so much with so little training? Certainly the best way to learn is not one time at the start of the year and never again but should be revisited and updated throughout the year. There seems to be no time built in for professional development at all in the current hybrid plan.  Again I do appreciate that all decisions regarding reopening were difficult to organize and I have looked at several other district plans. I do feel that this three-fold form of teaching in person to hybrid students and to 100% virtual students puts undue stress on my fellow teachers and on me. At a time where stress is running at an all-time high and with the likelihood of viral cases once again increasing to add additional layers of teaching that we collectively have never been trained for or have conducted before and that we very easily can be criticized and slandered for our faults is a difficult pill to swallow. I feel I am not being treated with the level of professionalism that I have earned for the level of degrees I hold for the years of experience I have with our district and absolutely not for the level of experiences I offer to my students.  -- Stephanie Burns Earth Science and Astronomy Teacher Connetquot High School STANYS Director at Large - Earth Science NYS Master Teacher Emeritus - Long Island,political,Facebook

As a candidate for FCSD#1 School Board I feel it is my responsibility to share my beliefs on mask usage in school as that is one of if not the number one issue on many parents and school staffs mind. So am I for masks or against masks? Both!  Will you personally see me out in the community wearing a mask outside of my work arena? Probably not. I feel that it is my personal right to make a choice for myself on what is best for my health. I do not think it is my governments job to protect my health but to protect my constitutional rights. It is my job to protect my health.  On June 9th I sent a letter to the board addressing my concerns with mask usage in the schools and included a petition with 325 parents signatures (circulating for only 3 days) requesting that the district stop considering mandatory mask usage at school. My main reason for doing this was because I was concerned with the lack of evidence on long term mask usage with young children whose bodies and organs are still developing. I wanted the district to consider the alternative and to have an idea how the community feels on this subject. Initially the CDC Dr. Fauci and many other health experts were telling the public masks werent necessary. This changed yes and I understand that science constantly changes and evolves but as parents citizens and people we should have a right to question it and implement critical thinking. In 1946 science and the medical profession believed DDT was an option to prevent polio in addition to its use as an insecticide. They sprayed DDT directly on to children on food surfaces buildings etc. It took decades before people began to question the safety of this product. Since 1996 EPA has been participating in international negotiations to control the use of DDT and other persistent organic pollutants used around the world (EPA). It is now classified as moderately toxic. Nicotine asbestos heroin  the list goes on and on regarding what science and the mass population once thought safe we now know are very harmful.  There is data on both sides of the debate regarding mask usage and you will always find studies or reports to confirm or disaffirm your opinions. We tend to follow science when it serves our purpose to perpetuate a confirmation bias and ignore it if it doesnt support our beliefs.  At this time I support wearing masks in school ultimately because I know that it is the only way to get our students back inside the building and learning. I choose to put aside my personal beliefs and compromise with my fellow community members for our students and my children. While homeschooling and virtual learning is effective for some students and families for many it just is not possible. I personally know my children listen better to other people and thrive in the school environment. They love their routine and structure and this is the case for the majority of our students. Additionally many parents do not have the option to keep their children at home to learn they have jobs that require them to be there. So if we dont support mask usage I see the problem of not being able to return to school and not being able to return to school creates a laundry list of problems I will address now.  First the disparity between the haves and the have nots will continue to grow. Parents that can afford to do so will send their students to private schools with smaller class sizes will choose to homeschool their students and ensure they are getting a quality education and will hire private tutors to help supplement instruction in their students education. It has happened all summer and it will continue to occur. Those children thats parents do not have the means to do this and have to work will leave their students at home unsupervised because they have no choice. These students will no doubt suffer and fall through the cracks trying to complete their virtual learning at home needing more support. If concepts in math and reading are built on top of previously learned information what happens to the students who failed to grasp concepts that are now presented with new concepts? They continue to struggle and fall farther and farther behind. It is very difficult for students that have fallen behind to catch up with other students who are continuing to progress and gain access to quality education.  Second the law states that each state and local education agency (LEA) must provide Free and Appropriate Public Education (FAPE) for all students. Many students do not have access to internet services computers and a learning environment unless they are in school. Not allowing students to return to school denies them the opportunity to FAPE. That means its a constitutional violation and there is obviously a lot of serious implications for this.  Third the mental health implications with keeping our students out of school are vast. Long term we do not know what we will see but short-term the data has already proven it. The cases of reported physical and sexual abuse have decreased in the country. Does this mean that abuse is declining no reports indicate it is probably actually increasing. This is because students may not have a safe space to share or have access to school staff and mandated reporters that can report these harmful situations.  Is it the schools responsibility to address mental health? Yes it actually is! The term education does not just refer to academic instruction it refers to an umbrella of services that include; academic social and emotional services to a child. That is why schools have to provide some students with counseling services and social skills training as part of their education it is the law. According to the American Medical Association More than 35 states have reported increases in opioid-related mortality as well as ongoing concerns for those with a mental illness or substance use disorder in counties and other areas within the state. So to summarize this means that our student population has suffered more from the economic and social secondary effects of lockdown and isolation from COVID-19 than the actual virus itself.  The last point I will make and one that I think is very important because I have heard again and again- What about the safety of our teachers and staff returning to school? And yes their safety is important so lets actually look at data to answer this and not just speculate. In Sweden schools were never I repeat NEVER shut down. In Denmark schools reopened 5 weeks after their lockdown on April 15th. The data comparing teachers exposure and cases of COVID-19 to those people that were not working in the schools show that teachers DID NOT show increased risk of COVID-19 cases. That is to say that teachers and school personnel have proven to not be at a greater risk of exposure to this virus versus those in other jobs. Researchers found in Sweden that staff members at day cares and primary schools were no more likely than people working in other professions to contract the virus. In Finland when public health researchers combed through test results of children under 16 they found no evidence of school spread and infection rate change from when schools were closed to when the reopened in May. In the USA a study of the YMCA who cared for up to 40000 children between the ages of 1-14 at over 1000 separate sites during the lock down (while their parents were health care professionals and essential employees) had a few positive cases but no more than one case at a site and no deaths among staff or children. There are almost no recorded cases of child-to-adult transmission of COVID-19 says Elliot Haspel an education policy expert and child care advocate.  I do think it is important for parents to know their childs rights. If your child has underlying health conditions or is receiving special education services in the school your child is entitled to additional rights under IDEA ADA etc. If mask wearing affects your child because of a medical condition or a psychological condition (anxiety trauma asthma etc.) then please know that the school cannot force your child to wear a mask. Because of HIPAA you do not need to disclose the condition.  According to most recent reports there are 3634 people in our state that have tested positive for COVID-19. Those numbers can be assumed to be underreported if asymptomatic carriers (those that have the virus and can spread it but do not show symptoms) exist. There have been 37 reported deaths in our state (some of which were not even in our state at the time of their deaths but are counted because of their residency). That is a percentage of 1% death rate or less. In children we have seen a 0% death rate in our state. For some perspective and further information the National Center for Health and Statistics reported on August 26 2020 COVID deaths accounted for 308 deaths in the United Stated from children ages 5-24 (data could not be separated out further to show school aged 5-18). So to further break this down of the 56.6 million students who attended elementary middle and high schools across the US 308 died of COVID-19 (0.00054% of deaths in school age children). To put this in perspective with other deaths as of August 26 2020 there have been 103 influenza deaths; 468 Pneumonia deaths; and a total of 21528 total deaths of children ages 5-24 years across the United States.  So while mask wearing may not fit my beliefs and I may feel COVID-19 is less of a threat it does not change the feelings of many other people in our community. I cannot change someones fears but I can be tolerant of their opinions and beliefs and compromise when necessary. I think the world needs a lot more tolerance these days and acceptance and not just acceptance of the beliefs that you agree with but the beliefs that you dont agree with. If wearing masks for our students to return to school is part of the solution then I support it without question. Because the data tells me the risks of not returning to school far outweighs the risks of mask use especially with the protocol being implemented in Lander schools where mask free time is allotted. I am anxious for the day when mask wearing will not even have to be a consideration.  There should be no division on any issue when it comes to what is best for our children!,political,Facebook

/       By Isabella Pelletiere  The Boston midweek traffic flows heavily along the connector of Massachusetts Avenue and Melnea Cass Boulevard as the spring weather is prevalent.  The clock hits 5pm. and amongst the chaos of the Wednesday drive home for many Bostonians stands a group of demonstrators holding signs and bullhorns.  The Boston Police Department directs the cars as the group marches in the middle of the street screaming we need a plan with the hope that one car will stop and listen. The individuals call themselves the South End Community Roxbury Partnership (SECRP)and with them are other groups like Chris Project and The Mass Ave Project.  This is Death Valley said Justin Downey of The Mass Ave Project. He motions across the street towards the loitered block. Groups of individuals are gathered together.  I had the mayor's top aid from recovery services tell me the other day to my face that not one person has died on this street said Downey you come down here to die. For years Bostons Methadone Mile got its name from the illegal open-air drug markets surrounding the methadone clinics on Massachusetts Avenue and Melnea Cass Boulevard also known as Mass and Cass. For drug addicts who frequent here the methadone clinics have served as places for temporary relief.  According to resident Marla Smith schools and their teams in the South End area can no longer use their fields and playgrounds for practicing since they are finding human waste biohazard materials and used condoms on childrens playgrounds and fields.  [This situation] has created a hostile toxic environment for the community for individuals who actually live here said Domingos DaRosa. DaRosa is the co-founder of SECRP and is also running for Boston City Councilor At-Large  The needle exchange program thats run by the city through a subcontractor called AHOPE is not working he said.  AHOPE is a harm reduction site and needle exchange program providing a range of services to active drug users.  The number of needles being has tripled and were only collecting a small percentage said DaRosa. According to Boston officials as of 2019 over 14000 needles were cleaned up and removed from the public streets.  DaRosa added that using your first amendment right to demonstrate and advocate for the quality of life for these individuals pushes these groups to keep protesting. Two women stand on a curb. One is Pamela Cummisky who lost her brother to drug addiction in February 2018. Her friend Don two years clean use to spend nights on the streets.  Im from Chris Project said Cummisky. Chris was a son a brother a father a musician an artist and an all-around good person she said.  It is the goal of Chris Project to help those fighting the same battle to be successful in that war said Cummisky.  People like Justin Downey of The Mass Ave Project come to bring Narcan clothes and food to people on the Methadone Mile while Cummusky hopes to open up a recovery resource center in honor of her brother.  As of 2019 the City of Boston released a Mass/Cass Strategic Plan. Boston City Councilor member Ed Flynn recently wrote he would call a hearing on Mass & Cass and would work closely with Governor Baker to ask for more assistance.  [We want] these elected officials to do something said Cummisky. The city just turns a blind eye; they do nothing about it,political,Facebook
MPS Families please READ and SHARE!  Being President of the Midland Public Schools Board of Education is no easy task. I wear a lot of different hats spend a lot of time in meetings and give my heart and soul toward the betterment of the district. I often miss little things like picking kids up from school practices and family dinners.  It is not all bad though. There are plenty of perks. Amongst my favorites are being able to hand out diplomas at graduation address the public on behalf of the board run the Board of Education meetings and to be a cheerleader for the district a hat I proudly and unabashedly wear.  In fact to that end I write today. As we get ready to close the book on our first month back in school (in whatever form that looks like) I want to take a few minutes of your time to lift our district and to talk about the good things we have accomplished together. To proudly display my cheerleader hat and talk about the success of Midland Public Schools during my eight years on the board.  Back in 2012 when I was first elected to the Board of Education MPS was facing several challenges and struggling as a district. I remember some of the big issues at the time were declining enrollment labor relation issues deficit spending and declining revenue. Although the facilities were in decent condition there was a complete lack of technology and building security was marginal at best. We also hired a new superintendent shortly after I was elected.  The hard work began immediately. Since 2012 the Board of Education has worked tirelessly and collaboratively with administration staff students families and community and corporate stakeholders to reimagine and reinvent what public education looks like in Midland. Through hard work dedication blood sweat and tears Midland Public Schools transformed into a model district now ranking amongst the absolute best in the country. An achievement we should all take great pride in and deserve credit for.  One of the most important (and long overdue) steps MPS recently took through board action was the creation and implementation of a DEI (Diversity Equity and Inclusion) initiative. I and my fellow board members worked hand in hand with students community members and administrators to create the MPS vision statement Lead with respect trust and courage. Ensure an equitable collaborative and inclusive culture. Enable all to achieve success. A statement I believe in wholeheartedly.  This vision statement was adopted by the board in July of 2020 and I have got to say I love it and so does our MPS community. Shortly thereafter in August the board took another giant step forward and adopted the Diversity Equity and Inclusion Proclamation: Resolution to Change the System Eliminate Racism and Create More Equitable and Inclusive Schools for All. This was a bold and necessary step designed to bring MPS to the forefront of racial equality and equitable inclusion and as I said before it was long overdue.  I passionately believe this is one of the most powerful and sweeping actions taken by the board during my eight-year tenure. The ripple effect will be wide and enduring. It will be hugely beneficial to both the district and community as we move forward and continue to refine how public education is delivered.  Continuing with the DEI initiative I and my fellow board members committed to attend ongoing DEI workshops. We need to get better and we will. The board committed to investing in a DEI leader who will continue leading this district once Dr. Amy Beasley returns to her post at Dow. The district will perform equity audits invest heavily in teacher and paraprofessional development and perform an administrator book study. We as a board and as a district have decided to stop talking the talk and to boldly start walking the walk. It is no longer ok to be ignorant.  Earlier I mentioned a lack of building security that existed when I was elected to the board. I am proud to say the security protocols have evolved and are now better and stronger than ever. In 2019 the board adopted an updated emergency operation plan that brought sweeping changes throughout the district.  The RAPTOR Emergency Management System was subsequently adopted which includes an emergency response plan and visitor check-in procedures. HALO Vape Sensors were installed in all secondary buildings. ALICE safety protocols were implemented along with the installation of door boot lockdown plates and shatterproof window film on all the buildings.  School Resource Officers were assigned to all four middle schools (thanks to the enhancement millage that was passed in 2018). Other measures include mental health and wellness initiatives secure entrances at all buildings video surveillance card reader access new PA/intercom systems installed district wide. All of this will allow for immediate emergency action and communication should the need arise. The security upgrades our district has undergone are simply amazing and place us amongst the most secure districts in the state perhaps the nation.  Other district initiatives that have been approved by the Board of Education include outstanding programs like: - Project Lead the Way - IB Diploma Programme (Dow and Midland High Schools) - IB Primary Years Programme (All MPS Elementary Schools) - PATHS / PASS - The creation of the pre-primary center at Carpenter School. (4-year old preschool and developmental kindergarten) - NWEA Assessment and Read by Grade 3  MPS and the Board of Education understand fully the importance of closing the achievement gap. To combat the gap MPS created the Pre-Primary Center and hired literacy coaches. Mental wellness partnerships have been forged and social emotional learning has been created and implemented. This includes extensive training for staff providing additional support staff and a partnership with SVSU.  Financially speaking I am immensely proud to report that MPS is standing on solid ground. Over the past eight years our audits have been clean. Perfect. MPS receives constant praise for its financial strength. Our board has been faced with cost-cutting initiatives some born out of necessity but many created by the administration and teachers alike. Adopting these initiatives was not easy but it was the right thing to do for the financial health of the district. Those decisions are paying off in spades.  MPS stands firmly amongst the most financially healthy districts in the state. Make no mistake there is a financial storm looming on the horizon and MPS will face many fiscal challenges soon but we are ready to meet those challenges head on.  To further clarify MPS has gone from a 6% fund balance in 2014 to a 30% fund balance just before 2020. This is almost unheard of in districts across the state and country. The strength of our financial position will allow for weathering of the ups and downs of the economy. It will allow MPS to invest in its employees. In fact all employees recently received salary increases and contracts remain open to additional increases. MPS can invest in capital improvements professional development opportunities and increased programming.  The financial strength of MPS also allows for continued building of partnerships critical to the development of our students and the stability of skilled trades within our community. MPS now leads county wide CTE and is also a proud partner of the Michigan Construction Academy. MPS has developed strong deep rooted partnerships with the MCEA and other community partners like United Way Midland Community Foundation local family foundations (Dow Family Gerstacker and Strosacker) and Dow Chemical Company. These partnerships help MPS remain a leader in raising funds grant proposals STEM IB PYP DEI and STEM to name a few.  It all boils down to this Midland Public Schools is succeeding on so many levels and we need to shout it from the mountaintops! Year after year IB and AP students succeed. MPS has award winning programs in art music journalism CTE and yes athletics. We dominate in athletics. Not to mention MPS has a WORLD CLASS robotics programs at the elementary middle school and high school levels.  The Project Lead the Way program has had tremendous success and has married nicely to the STEM strategic plan. To brag a little more according to 2020 Niche Rankings MPS is among the top 5% best school districts in America. Top 6% best teachers in America. Top 4% best school district in Michigan and top 5% best teachers in Michigan as well as one of the best places to teach in Michigan. Additionally 2020 U.S. News and World Reports ranks Dow High in the top 3.4% of high schools in Michigan while Midland High comes in at the top 6.9% of high schools in Michigan. Our Teachers paraprofessionals and administrators are award winning and recognized throughout the state.  I often get asked why on earth would you want to be on the school board? My response is simple. I love this place. I love Midland Public Schools and everything it stands for. I love serving this community. The four biggest reasons however are my four children. They are more engaged and excited to learn than ever before. I could not be happier that they are part of such a talented diverse cutting edge district.  Do we have work to do? Yes. We have a long road ahead. But just for a moment I wanted to tell you about how far we have come and what we have achieved. That is something to be proud of and something I as a member of this Board for eight years am happy to hang my hat on.  I want to express my SINCERE gratitude to our teachers paraprofessionals administrators community partners and stakeholders. Without each of you MPS would undoubtedly be a quite different place. I have been blessed with the opportunity to serve our beloved district for eight years. Thank you for that. To my fellow board members Jon Phil Pam Lynn Mary and Brad thank you for your service. My family and I appreciate all of you and the sacrifices you each make for MPS.  My commitment to all of you is this: I will continue to lead with respect trust and courage. I will continue to work to be a steward of public trust and will do my absolute best to ensure MPS fully develops and continues to foster a learning environment that is collaborative inclusive diverse and equitable. True to our vision statement I will work tirelessly to ensure MPS remains a district where all can achieve success.

Can we talk mental health?  A key element of my campaign is Equity and Access for all. This represents my commitment to providing the best possible environment and promote the best opportunities and outcomes for all students through addressing their individual mental social-emotional and physical needs. Below I have chosen to outline several steps and strategies that I believe are within the scope and responsibilities a School Board Trustee may employ in order to serve the constituents and stakeholders within the district. Particularly as it relates to increasing the ability of the district and its employees to address and provide resources for mental health:   As a Trustee I would continuously advocate to state level officials in the legislative branch and beyond about increasing the Base Student Cost-which is used to fund South Carolina school districts. Currently South Carolina has not fully funded education under this model (as outlined in state law) for many years. Should the Base Student Cost be increased the district would receive additional funding from the SC General Assembly and it would be my mission to see these funds prioritized to hire more highly qualified teachers professional school counselors and school psychologists. Additionally allocate funds to provide district teachers and employees with professional development and training that focuses on student mental health and trauma informed practice. These priorities would allow our district to improve its responsiveness to mental health and trauma and thereby increasing our ability to meet the needs of every student.   Another avenue that I would continuously pursue would be to expand current and seek out new partnerships with area non-profits community outreach programs and local businesses. Students would not only gain work experience but the focus on mentoring and relationship building would be key. Our district has a diverse population with students that have varying degrees of need and it is our responsibility to be responsive to those needs. Seeking ways to expand these programs and provide new opportunities would continue to empower students to overcome their individual hardships by building resilience and increasing their ability to meet and succeed at new challenges.  Safeguarding the mental health of our students is critical to the district's mission children first every day. We all need to continue investing in our greatest resources our students and our wonderful staff. As a Trustee it would be my honor to represent the community and to always have their best interest at the forefront when doing so.,political,Facebook

"Good afternoon  As a resident of the Shore Drive area I am very concerned about Westminster-Canterbury's plans to construct a 22-story building adjacent to their current facilities. This will certainly affect the quality of life of the Shore Drive community.  That said and knowing that you are running for city council can you please share with me how you would vote on this measure?  Thank you X.  .....  This question comes from a prominent business manager in Virginia Beach. They emailed me at my AOL account I responded there and I also want the voters of VB to know too.  I cannot afford to blanket myself on an extreme with city Property Development. By that I mean I won't say ""Yes develop everything"" nor will I say ""Never develop again."" Heck I want Virginia Beach to become a diversified Tech Hub so there'll be development Ill approve in the future. But I'll have an internal checklist to go over to make sure I vote correctly on any particular future development.  Things I want to check off my list: is the development conscious of flooding and the environment are the propertys developers heavy into the pockets of my council peers do the citizens around the development actually want it and are any tax dollars going to the development that are otherwise improperly used?  Simple right?  I'll begin with tax dollars. You ever look at our Agricultural Reserve Program? It was speculated in 2018 that ending that would save $4 million a year in subsidy. It is spent on keeping people -from- developing their farmland. I'd prefer just to deny development plans when they come up as opposed to spend tax dollars to coax the owner to not develop which the ARP does. Conversely if we are to spend tax money to develop something it better come from a pot of revenue specifically raised for development like the tourism funds and development like the Dome site.  If tax money was to be spent on the 22 story WC building and it isn't tourism funding then I vote no.  I haven't seen the plans for the building but being on the Bayfront brings long term risks to sea level rise and flooding. However the rest of the buildings and houses in that area do too - so if the plans are conscious of flooding and environmentally respectful I would vote for the 22 story WC building.  Be it reward or enticement Im viscerally opposed to the corruptive effects of big money in politics. The same contractors that built the 17th Street Sports Center at the Oceanfront also donated $12000 to the incumbent Mayor. I don't want to get that involved in city development that thousands of dollars are thrown at me. No conflict of my interests here please.  So if the developers were giving money to council people in weirdly high amounts - I'll vote against the project.  Community acceptance of the project is the most important part. I have been attending the VBCCO Virginia Beach Council of Civic Organizations for over a year and the most commonly brought up topics are the Thalia Wayside development and this Westminster Canterbury development. There is angst in the room about those projects and the Thalia one is already pulled at this time due to public pushback. There is great pushback in the Shore Drive area for this project and what would result of the area due to it being built. Westminster Canterbury is also doing a slow plodding hostile takeover of the surrounding condos. They buy one apartment at a time in order to secure enough leverage to assume control of boards then they change bylaws and gain the legal ability to remove tenants from the building who couldnt effectively prohibit their being forced out.  I wouldnt want to reward WCs efforts by clearing them to build a 22-story tall building that resulted from this predatory chess game.  So if I was on Council and it was on my docket to vote yes or no  I am voting no.  By the way I love Chess. Hope to earn your vote!  - Conrad Schesventer Rose Halls City Council seat candidate.

Why is it important that Richardson maintains a business friendly environment? Richardson taxpayers contribute only 39% of the property taxes to the city while businesses contribute 61%. If we lose new business development and order companies move their businesses out of Richardson we the homeowners in Richardson will be responsible for a larger portion of the property taxes the city needs to operate. Recently our council turned down Dave's Chicken at the Richardson Food Park. This development has struggled to retain business with DogHaus being the lone original business within the park. Dave's is a franchise however the Franchisee would be a longtime Richardson resident who owns several businesses in Richardson as well as leads one of our prominent churches. The vote came down to a menu board. Let me repeat that a menu board. Why on earth would we deny a citizen of our city the ability to open up a new business in a struggling area over a menu board? Probably because a handful of people oppose the drive thru with a menu board.I have talked to between 75 and 100 people that live in that area and no one I talked to was opposed to this entity. Life has changed after covid and services like UberEats Grubhub and Doordash have thrived and the necessity of restaurants with a drive thru option are needed now more than 2 years ago. This item is coming up before council again soon along with Eiland Coffee. It too will have a drive thru and when it was denied 2.5 years ago they had over 100 supporters for the project. It was just too large for the plot. Now its coming back with a larger piece of land to accommodate the owner's vision. It had also come to my attention that several of the citizens against Daves and at least one councilperson would rather have some affordable housing built in the empty spaces left in the restaurant park. Why would we want a affordable housing building put on a plot of land along our most visible corridor shoehorned in between restaurants and car dealerships?  The same night the council denied Dave's they approved a Popeye's with a drive thru along Beltline and Plano road. Interesting. A lot of inferences can be made by this decision. Joe Corcoran Arefin Shamsul Jennifer Justice and Ken Hutchenrider all voted against great growth and support for the Richardson food park. I implore everyone to reach out to them to support Dave's Hot Chicken and Eiland Coffee when it comes up in a few weeks. Their emails are joe.corcoran@cor.gov arefin.shamsul@cor.gov jennifer.justice@cor.gov and ken.hutchenrider@cor.gov  I do not have any vested interest in this development however I do have an interest in seeing our city thrive. We cannot deny viable businesses(especially Richardson owned) from operating in our city.,political,Facebook

Dear Neighbors:  Wyomings Energy Economy Economic Diversification and the Need to Make Changes Now  This message wont be the most upbeat one Ive written but I think it speaks to a major challenge we face in Wyoming  the need for a straightforward discussion about our domestic energy economy and the implications for its decline. (Tomorrow Ill spend some time talking about the implications of the global energy market for Wyomings energy industry.) You would expect me to say we are in an economic bust with no boom in sight. I think that is correct. Weve been lucky to be rich in minerals and fuels (which has driven our recent economic booms) and to have a market for these commodities. Im concerned that this was almost too much of a good thing and now we are paying the price for being spoiled by the notion that this largesse would never end. With the decline in our extractive industries and other COVID-19 related income declines we are facing a deficit of about 1/3 of our income and this is leading to deep cuts in state services. There will be no area of state government untouched and these cuts will be felt by all Wyomingites.  But thats only background to the purpose of this note. My real point is that we need honest discussion about the situation we are in. We are an economy that depends on the preferences of our customers. In the League of Women Voters Candidate Forum for HD 45 (just posted on July 17) I noted that although we continue to produce significant energy (and 40% of the nations coal) were in a buyers market where the customers want cleaner and cleaner energy. Our ability to sell our commodities is linked directly to what customers in California Washington Oregon Colorado etc. want to buy. They want lower carbon fuel options. That is a reality that wont change.  So before we blame the Federal government and its regulations on the decline in our fossil fuel industry lets think about this a little more. It isnt Federal regulation or EPA rules that are causing our extractive industries to struggle and our income to plummet. Instead it is the nature of our resource dependent economy. We are exporters of commodities subject to market forces and customer preferences we cannot control. Before we jump on the familiar litany about the Feds lets remember three things. 1) On the proactive side lets take this lesson to heart  we need to diversify our economy NOW. We should have done this a decade ago. I think most Republicans and Democrats are on board with this point. 2) Lets avoid the blame game with the Feds as the evil actor despite how tempting it often is. This isnt the reality of this situation. (Ironically it was Clean Air Act regulations that created a boom in Wyoming when our low sulfur coal became much more desirable than dirtier Appalachian coal. We loved the EPA when it worked in our favor!). 3. Lets remember as a people that Americans have firmly embraced the importance of preserving our environment. This is a value that pays off dividends for the natural world human health gives us recreation options and economic dividends as well. For example we should be justifiably proud of the reclamation work done around our coal mines.  So while it is tempting to play the blame game particularly in the partisan political context what we really need to do is look firmly forward and take this opportunity to make the changes weve needed to do for years. Lets invest in helping people in affected communities have access to the education and retraining they need to find new jobs. Lets invest in proven businesses and new business to create good jobs for the people affected most by this change in our employment environment.,political,Facebook
Fellow Residents: PLEASE READ  With the election just days away I urge you to remember these indisputable facts:  1) The only reason my opponents would release a scathing letter containing entirely false information is that they are desperate. They do not have a positive vision or platform to gain support so their only other option is to blind voters with lies about a candidate that only has the best interest of every resident at heart.  2) I have been completely transparent throughout this entire campaign process. I have shared everything relevant about my credentials and capabilities and have encouraged residents to contact me with questions or concerns; I am always here to talk and answer any of your questions. I have received many emails and calls already and I encourage you to continue doing so. You all are my neighbors you know who I am. You know I care very deeply about this village.  3) We all share a common interest here-- the well being of our community for the benefit of EVERY resident who lives here. We all want a better more intuitive Belle Terre. This can only be done through an administration who has the village's best interest at heart not an administration that slanders their neighbors. I am running for mayor to create a more inclusive and more professional environment for all residents.  4) This can be a real positive turning point for our community if we make the right choice this Tuesday. I envision so much more for our community than just the preservation of the bare minimum. I thank past administrations for all the good they have done but our village deserves more. If given the chance I can provide Belle Terre the care and effort it deserves!  Vote ENRICO SCARDA for Belle Terre Mayor this Tuesday from 12-9 at the Community Center.,political,Facebook
Mental Health/Social Emotional Support for Peabody Students  Dear Friends  Since we launched our campaign earlier this year the Bukia Chalvire for Councilor at Large team has knocked on numerous doors spoke to voters at their homes had one on one private meetings with individuals and families. We can't help but notice the ongoing stress fear grief isolation and uncertainty families are experiencing created by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Covid-19 pandemic can wear anyone down but many children and teens have had an especially tough time coping emotionally. At the same time many families have been separated from loved ones and caregivers including grandparents who may serve as vital source of support. As more people get COVID-19 vaccines there is growing hope that pressures of the pandemic will ease. But the struggles and losses of the past year will likely continue to affect families for some time to come. If your child faces a mental health emergency call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room. If needed reach out to 1-800-273-8255 or texting the Crisis Text Line by texting 'TALK' to 741741. Massachusetts schools will be getting a windfall as they prepare to open for full-time instruction. The aid includes $1.8 billion for elementary and secondary schools and $825 million for colleges universities. Peabody will be getting $11 Mil from the COVID relief package. According to the Salem news. When elected I will strongly advocate for the importance of providing school-based mental health support for our children because these services benefit students academically socially and emotionally. Remember school is not just a place where students gain academic knowledge; it is where they prepare for life. By doing our part to create a safe and emotionally supportive environment we can increase the odds that students will succeed beyond the walls of the classroom.

Photographer and Cinematographer at heart since the first day I looked through a lens.  Who Am I 3 years ago I retired from my long management career and love my life in Sand City cherish my connections to its citizenry and always work on giving back to this community that gives me so much every day.  A naturalized United States Citizen since 1991 I am in love with Sand Citys energy and character. I am in love with its wealth of working artists and have been working on bringing them together to create even more artwork.  4 years ago I organized the first time ever collective art show in Sand City. 25 artists participated in that historic show.  I invited those artists to come together in a nonprofit organization that dedicates itself to the growth of the Sand City Artistic Community. Sand City Art Foundation sponsored the Sand City Community Garden beehives by Krimp Fuentes and The Trees Of Sand City by Eleen Auvil.  I created a flyer in support of SCPD when I saw that our police department was being taken for granted by some people in the City Government. I printed ten. Put two in my windows and gave the rest away. I did not print or pay for the dozens of those flyers that popped up in everyones windows.  What I Would Like To Do  I would like to continue helping promote Sand City Artists as much and as often as I can and work towards my goal of one day creating a drive through museum curated by Sand City Artists work. I would like to get the City Administration to get out of policing-the-art business and support artists outside of the government framework.  I would like to work with other Council Members and the City Administration to improve the working conditions at the City Offices. The feeling of these offices was once described to me by a City Employee as: Feels like a dungeon. That is not healthy. To have a healthy city we need healthy city employees and that asks for a healthy work environment. I would like to change that.  I would like to work with the SCPD to help them bring their staffing policies and budget into present time and aligned with the rising needs of the city as it expands and increases in population and businesses.  I would like to work with the Public Works Department and find a way of fixing part of the city structure that needs repair and maintenance. I believe if Elena John Fisk and Frank Christy generate tax revenue for the city we cannot tell them their stores are in Seaside. And that is not the only location that needs TLC.  I would like to work with the City Clerck and Manager to stream line the process the businesses go through when they deal with the city. Let us help businesses spend their time taking care of their customers rather than pushing paper for the city.

FOR Nebraska Inc. promotes healthy safe use of Nebraskas rivers.  The increasing number of airboats on Nebraskas rivers is an issue for all Nebraskans. Citizens have reported hearing airboat noise miles from Nebraskas rivers during all hours of the day including late at night and early morning. Weddings church attendance funerals family reunions picnics community center gatherings classroom learning non-motorized sports outings and daily conversations have been interrupted by deafening vibrations and noise of airboats.  Airboats offer speed and access to rivers where other watercraft cannot go but this speed is accompanied by noise pollution and disruption to the environment and surrounding communities. Unlike highways railroads and airports infrastructure airboat noise is recreational with rare exceptions for search rescue and environmental studies. Persons on airboats wear earplugs and headgear to protect their hearing. People and animals near Nebraskas rivers do not have ready access to this protection.  Responsible citizens need to report airboat noise pollution to authorities as a nuisance or annoyance which is not an emergency. Use the following links to report airboat noise:     Calls about airboat noise are logged. Elected officials use evidence to consider further Nebraska legislation regarding regulation of airboats and noise.  F.O.R. Nebraska Inc. promotes healthy safe use of Nebraskas rivers. F.O.R. Nebraska Inc.s recommendations include lowering airboat noise below 75 decibels restricting hours and dates of airboat use limiting numbers of airboat licenses and a curfew.

Now is probably a good time to talk about wages in Idaho. One thing that the ongoing pandemic has shown us is that many Idahoans are not prepared to face short-term income shortfalls let alone long-term ones. That probably does not surprise you but do you know what might? Even if you took the current economic crisis out of the picture nearly half of your friends and neighbors here in Idaho Falls (44% according to a recent United Way report) dont earn enough to meet their basic needs. Does that sound like the way we want Idaho Falls to be? I grew up in an Idaho Falls that comes together when the going gets rough. We look for solutions not excuses. When I was at Hillcrest High School in 1997 friends and I joined with other residents to come together to help fill sandbags when the rising Snake River threatened downtown businesses. In Idaho Falls we believe in the strength of our community. Thats just the way we are.  My opponent is quick to point out what he thinks we should not do and instead of offering a new solution suggests we keep doing what we have been doing. Perhaps eventually it will work. In the mean time we will continue to foster a society that is dependent on the government bureaucracy my opponent is so experienced in building in other states.  My successful career in the private sector has taught me that often in business you have to be willing to change your model to adapt to changes in the current economic environment. It is much the same when looking at these types of societal problems. We need to be focused on finding and discussing solutions. Much of the time I spent in career and technical education (nearly 10 years) was focused on evaluating the needs of a community and developing program offerings to meet those needs. This problem cannot be simply solved with one decision. There are certainly discussions to be had about wages but there are more ways to build a solution that works besides the two options my opponent suggests.  I launched my first company in April of 1998 the spring of my junior year of high school right here in Idaho Falls. I was active in the Chamber of Commerce and was a charter member of the evening Civitan Club that was active in Idaho Falls. I understood then as I know now that in Idaho Falls we move forward by working together to solve problems. Its the way things are done here in Idaho Falls.  After having worked in the private sector for years I decided that I wanted to do more. I found that my proven leadership and experience had a place in the non-profit world and have spent the last several years working in the non-profit sector. Running for the state legislature has given me even more potential to share my experience and leadership serving the people of Idaho Falls. Helping people its just the way I was raised.,political,Facebook
"By definition a landfill is about decay. A community that chooses decay as its economic engine risks being defined as rotten. - Chris Kelly Outatime 11/15/2014  Like many Dunmoreans I fear what will happen to our area if Keystone Sanitary Landfill (KSL) receives DEP approval for its four-decade expansion. If approved KSL will collect mostly out-of-state waste until 2064 and add over 94 MILLION TONS of trash to our small Borough. It hurts to say but many reading this probably wont be around to see the last truck head up the trash-made mountain. The landfill will dwarf its current size and grow 220 feet higher. It will act as a huge ""welcome sign"" greeting visitors to our area.  How can we with straight faces convince young people small businesses and large companies to put roots down in Dunmore with a barren mountain of hazardous trash setting the backdrop?  I believe it is well past time we stop mortgaging our future by doubling down on previous generations' mistakes. Dunmore has relied too heavily on KSL for 30+ years and as a result has put our Boroughs health reputation environment and finances at risk. If you want to know just how bad the landfill has been for the Borough or you need a refresher I urge you to read HERE () and HERE ().  According to KSL with no expansion they have roughly five years left to operate. This seems like an ideal opportunity for Dunmore to leave the landfill behind and start promoting our Borough as a forward-thinking place that is open to new ideas people and businesses. COVID-19 while tragic and taxing on all of us has opened up new possibilities for areas like Dunmore. With remote work becoming part of the new normal areas like Dunmore which provide second to none services fantastic schools and relatively affordable home prices are attractive places for young people to lay roots. The proximity to New York and Philadelphia gives us a distinct advantage in luring new businesses moving out of major cities but still need the convenience of a short drive to these areas. I am afraid a massive expansion of KSL will deter these people from considering our area as a place to call home. I think it is well past time we start looking towards the future of Dunmore. A future that is open to new ideas people and businesses. A future that has no room for a massive landfill expansion.",political,Facebook

Are you for the education of all students or the politics of certain adults?  At the LCSD1 Board meeting on Monday October 4 there will be an organized effort to complain about masks and about what some people believe to be Critical Race Theory. (Watch it live or recorded)  The question needs to be asked of every speaker. Does that speaker care about the education of all students or about his or her adult political agenda?  The medical experts and medical researchers recommend masks in schools in order to keep schools in person. People who do their own research seem to think they know more and are swayed by other people who are also not experts.  So again what do they value? In person education of all students or personal petty politics?  On the literacy program experts (coordinators teachers professors and more) have pointed out that Critical Race Theory is not in schools or the literacy program. Again people who do their own research found things that apparently all the experts have missed.  But as they speak tonight listen carefully. Are they speaking for the education of all students or for personal adult politics?  For example chart the authors they mention and the books they cite. Are they by all authors or are they mostly by authors of color with characters of color? The results will tell you all you need to know.  Unfortunately our local school board meetings have been impacted by people who care more about adult political agendas. Too few speakers have cared about the education and educational environment of all students.  I hope that changes soon.,political,Facebook
To the Board of Selectmen:  I am submitting this correspondence as a formal complaint with the following two points:  1. I have had the opportunity to review the interview packet submitted by Mr. Stavola and in fact the term removed was used; however the nature of his removal was not disclosed. I find it disheartening that certain members of the Board of Selectmen were aware of the nature of his removal and failed to disclose it during the public meeting. I do understand that I had the opportunity to pose the question during that interview; however I know the truth now and I would be remiss if I did not act on behalf of my constituents.  2. With regard to the complaint filed by Vice Chairman Vaillancourt dated May 3 2021 there are three concerns that I gravitate toward immediately: A. That Vice Chairman Vaillancourt is being denied access to information and is being put into a position to support data and/or conclusions that are being presented to the public without taxpayer oversight. B. That Chairman Stavola additionally is behaving as a bully and creating a toxic working environment subjecting commission members to ridicule and what amounts to public votes of forced allegiance. C. That both Chairman Stavola and First Selectman Bylone are fostering an environment of unprofessionalism counterproductive to the mandate of the commission.  The First Amendment right is afforded to everyone as evidenced by the Police Unions stance on Officer Kowalskys right in commenting albeit they were demeaning. I would argue that an officer acting in his/her official capacity should be held to a higher bar of professionalism. It would appear not everyone present held that belief as witnessed by the fact that Stavola and Bylone did nothing in their leadership capacity to address this inappropriate behavior which could be construed as insubordinate disrespectful and should therefore be actionable.  The fact that there seems to be a disconnect by all parties regarding the role of the Police Commission leaves me troubled. The Police Commissions role is to act as taxpayer-based oversight entity to provide transparency and accountability to the public in conjunction with management as to the operations of our local police force.  In conversations with Vice Chairman Vaillancourt she has stated that she did in fact ask for supporting data both on the political removal of the SRO and the police crime and call statistics that were being used to present to the public. This request for data was not provided to Vice Chairman Vaillancourt. As a result Sargent Edwards presented inaccurate data to the public to justify the addition of two additional police officers on the basis of increased call volume and overall crime.  Both Chairman Stavola and First Selectman Bylone unilaterally worked on the data that ended up in the police presentation to the public. When the inaccuracies between the two budget books were brought to light during a public Board of Finance presentation by Mr. Bisbikos well over a month ago the public was promised by the First Selectman Bylone that this would be examined and rectified. To date the data has not been corrected in this years budget book. As a result the public will be asked to decide at the towns referendum based on inaccurate data. There needs to be an explanation as to why that data was inaccurate and why it still remains that way. The truth of the matter is that both call volume and crime has been declining. A noteworthy point to mention is that Chairman Stavola also attended other boards and passed the inaccurate data to them to create a false narrative to justify the additional officers.  The Police Commission held a special session that entered into a closed-door executive session hearing to discuss the actions of both Vice Chairman Vaillancourt and Officer Kowalsky. Vice Chairman Vaillancourt was denied her statutory ability to call for the discussion of her actions and performance to be public. As a result of this denial the commission proceeded to engage in an illegal meeting. Two quick points here. 1. Vice Chairman Vaillancourt refused to participate in the session. 2. Had the Vice Chairman entered into this session she would be precluded from publicly disclosing any topics of discussion in order to defend herself.  The following is the statute outlining executive sessions: (6) Executive sessions means a meeting of a public agency at which the public is excluded for one or more of the following purposes: (A) Discussion concerning the appointment employment performance evaluation health or dismissal of a public officer or employee provided that such individual may require that discussion be held at an open meeting; (B) strategy and negotiations with respect to pending claims or pending litigation to which the public agency or a member thereof because of the members conduct as a member of such agency is a party until such litigation or claim has been finally adjudicated or otherwise settled; (C) matters concerning security strategy or the deployment of security personnel or devices affecting public security; (D) discussion of the selection of a site or the lease sale or purchase of real estate by the state or a political subdivision of the state when publicity regarding such site lease sale purchase or construction would adversely impact the price of such site lease sale purchase or construction until such time as all of the property has been acquired or all proceedings or transactions concerning same have been terminated or abandoned; and (E) discussion of any matter which would result in the disclosure of public records or the information contained therein described in subsection (b) of section 1-210.  Considering these details one could most certainly draw the conclusion as an elected official and as a taxpayer that both Chairman Stavola and First Selectman Bylone got caught in a lie. As a result of being caught they are using their political influence to silence and remove an individual that exposed this deception. I personally believe that Vice Chairman Vaillancourt has served in the best interest of the citizens of Colchester and in fact should be commended for attempting to provide the transparency that we all deserve.  I would also be remiss if I did not mention the fact that the Board of Selectmen is choosing to not address Vice Chairman Vaillancourts complaint against Chairman Stavola which was issued first and entered into the public record during the May 6 2021 Board of Selectmen meeting. There was no discussion allowed under correspondence to address the complaint. However we are allowing for a complaint based on political retribution to be strongly considered against Vice Chairman Vaillancourt.  As a side note Vice Chairman Vaillancourt also submitted her complaint to the Diversity and Inclusion Committee which is comprised of all females of which two sit on the Board of Selectmen. I find it difficult that there has been zero engagement by the committee to communicate with a woman who is asking for help to address a toxic working environment. An example of this would be Chairman Stavola forcing a public vote of confidence in a Police Commission session after news media articles addressing his removal.  On a personal note: Chairman Stavolas wife attempted to publicly slander me by making false statements to the Rivereast newspaper in the April 23 2021 edition. I rebuked her claims in the following weeks paper clearly restating my comments that actually were made and recorded both online and during the Board of Finance Budget Workshop via Zoom. One must ask the question was she acting as his proxy? Furthermore Chairman Stavola issued a false and unsubstantiated quote he attributed to Mr. Bisbikos in the May 14th edition of the Rivereast in an attempt to slander and politically assassinate his character. All this in an attempt to move the publics eye away from the complaint issued by the Vice Chairman against Chairman Stavola outlining his bullying lack of professionalism and outright lying to the public.  In closing it saddens me to see Our First Selectman acting unilaterally as a bully and perpetuating that behavior in eliciting the assistance of Mr. Stavola to do the same to push a political agenda. I am asking that the Board of Selectman join me in correcting this mistake by placing a motion on the table to remove Chairman Stavola.  I ask that this correspondence be added to the minutes of our next meeting and that the topic be included as an agenda item as well.  Respectfully  Taras W.

Do what you love and youll never work a day in your life. That motto sums up my lifelong career in the maritime industry. Ive been successful both as a corporate executive and also as the principle of my consulting business. My biggest achievement was working with my staff local and federal government environmental groups and citizens to grow the port of New York and New Jersey into the East Coast Gateway for international cargo. I was successful in my career because I could balance the needs of business recreation and conservation while navigating the bureaucracy of government. I want to bring that experience and my passion for our waterways to seat #4 of St. Augustines Port Waterways and Beaches Commission.  A bit more about me. After leaving the Big Apple and my maritime career behind my family and I decided to relocate in Saint Augustine. It is a gift that I treasure daily because it allows me to continue pursuing my passion for developing Port facilities. It seems to be in my DNA. Since moving to Saint Augustine I have had volunteer leadership roles with the 450th Commemoration and Saint Augustine Yacht Club and helped established the Saint Augustine Maritime Heritage Foundation.  My campaign is based upon three core values: Access Conservation and Accountability.  Access: I look at the harbor in Saint Augustine as an underutilized recreational resource. We have all navigable channels federally maintained but yet there is no public water transport that conveniently runs from either Anastasia Island or Vilano into the old city. With the unprecedented growth of Saint Johns County we already have insufficient boat and personal landing and launching facilities. We have magnificent ocean beaches with far too few public parking areas.  Conservation: Due to projected growth in St. Johns county we must manage our environment for the future. Our environment and estuaries are under attack I will advocate to preserve open spaces and create sustainable open public use water access areas.  Accountability: We as members of the port commission have a great opportunity to revisit and amend aspects of the charter identifying and updating areas in response to growth and change in our county.  As a member of the commission I will support and identify goals and further existing initiatives that meet the objectives for the commission. It is my vision to have the commission play an active role in the future development and sustainability of our waterways.  These are the key reasons why I have decided to seek a seat on the Port Waterways and Beaches Commission. I ask for your vote to Seat #4 in the November 3rd election.

The primary justice issue in the Bible is economic justice. Many issues that we think of as justice issues today (like democracy racism human rights gender equality the environment) had not yet come up. For the most part the Bible doesn't address them. Rather its passion for justice is focused on economic justice. -From Injustice to Justice #OnADivineAssignment,political,Facebook
Angela Lowreys Political Philosophy:  I believe one of the highest privileges a person can receive is to be entrusted with the election vote of their fellow community members. Your vote directly says: I trust you I believe in you I am asking you to stand for me.  To be asked to be their voice to be trusted with the spending of their hard-earned money to oversee the health of their families while also protecting the environment is an immense honor.  I believe a healthy democracy is the foundation of a thriving community. To honor the past while embracing the future; creating relationships of trust and mutual respect; actively addressing issues while securing opportunities; and introducing venues for participation by the public we serve  that is my political philosophy as a public servant.  Serving on boards and committees is a huge responsibility. You have to be honest and fair. You must accept you are never going to please all the people all the time but you can be selfless and stand up for what is right for the long-term sustainability of the communities you represent. It is not about being popular but doing what is right.  You must be prepared to do a lot of reading research attend meetings and ask the difficult questions.  Having networks within the community and wastewater industry to be able to make informed decisions  and not just rubber stamp what you are being told by other people.  You must be fiscally responsible knowing you are spending money which is not yours.  I believe that some community decisions can be made by elected officials but the ones with big price tags need to have direct approval from voters.  That reservoirs of goodwill are created through targeted community engagement  ensuring that those you serve know how you are working within a structured government operation on their behalf. They have opportunities to give direct feedback and participate as most appropriate.  You must act in a manner which is transparent and withstands scrutiny  my creed as a public wastewater professional has always been Everything I do could make the front-page of the newspaper make sure it a positive story which respects my customers honors the industry and generates pride by my hard-working parents who sacrificed much for me.  In my opinion Oakley is at an important crossroad right now. There are tough decisions to be made about the future prosperity of our community. We need strong leadership in public service as we navigate economic success beyond COVID-19.  I am ready to step up and serve as your representative on the Ironhouse Sanitary District Board of Directors this election season. I hope I can earn your vote.,political,Facebook
"WANT TO KNOW WHY WE ARE VOTING FOR TRUMP! IT'S YOU!.  If you are a liberal who cant stand Trump and cannot possibly fathom why conservatives would ever vote for him let me finally fill you in.  Its not that we love Donald Trump so much. Its that we cant stand you. And we will do whatever it takes  even if that means electing a rude obnoxious unpredictable narcissist (your words-not ours) to the office of President of the United States  because the only thing we find more dangerous to this nation than Donald Trump is you.  How is that possible you might ask? Well you have done everything in your power to destroy our country from tearing down the police to tearing down our history to tearing down our borders. You are systematically destroying our schools and brainwashing our kids into believing socialism is the answer to anything (despite being an unmitigated failure everywhere) while demonizing religion and faith and glorifying abortion violence and thug culture.  From calling us racists every time we expect everyone of any skin color to follow our laws equally to telling us that our tolerance of lifestyles we dont agree with isnt nearly enough....no we must celebrate any lifestyle choice or gender option (forget science) you throw our direction or you think its fine to calls us homophobic or some other degrading slur  and ironically all while lecturing us on hate speech. While you gaslight us about 52 genders polyamory grown men in dresses sharing public locker rooms with little girls and normalize the sexualization of young children you simultaneously ridicule us for having the audacity to wish someone a Merry Christmas or hang a flag on the 4th of July stand for the national anthem or (horror or horrors) don a MAGA hat in public. So much for your tolerance. Do you see why we think you are hypocrites??  Were also not interested in the fact that you think you can unilaterally decide that 250 years of the right-to-bear-arms against a tyrannical or ineffective government should be abolished because you cant get the violence in the cities you manage under control. Free-speech should be tossed out the window history erased and those who disagree with your opinions are fair game for public harassment or doxing. Spoiled children with nose-rings and tats who still live off their parents dime should be allowed to destroy cities and peoples livelihoods without repercussions. That chaos and lawlessness and disrespect for authority should be the norm. This is your agenda. And you wonder why we find you more dangerous than Donald Trump?  Your narrative is a constant drone of oppressor/oppressed race-baiting intended to divide the country in as many ways as you possibly can. You love to sell victim-hood to people of color every chance you get because its such an easy sell compared to actually teaching people to stand on their own two feet and take personal responsibility for their own lives their own communities and their own futures. But you wont do that. You will never do that because then you will lose control over people of color. They might actually start thinking for themselves God forbid!  This is why we will vote for Donald Trump.It is not because he is the most charming character on the block nor because he is the most polite politician to have ever graced the oval office. It is not because he is the most palatable choice not that we love his moral character or because he never lies. It is because we are sick to death of you and all of the destructive crap you are doing to this once beautiful and relatively safe country. Your ineffective and completely dysfunctional liberal leadership(?) has literally destroyed our most beautiful cities our public education system and done its damndest to rip faith out of peoples lives.  However bad Donald Trump may be (and he is far from perfect) every day we look at you and feel that no matter what Donald Trump says or does there is no possible way he could be any worse for our country than you people are.  We are sick to death of your stupid destructive ignorant and intolerant behavior and beliefs  parading as wokeness. We are beyond sick of your hypocrisy and B.S. We are fed up with your disrespectful divisiveness and constant unrelenting harping and whining and complaining (while you live in the most privileged nation in the world) while making literally zero contributions of anything positive to our society. Your entire focus is on ripping things down never ever building anything up. Think about that as there is something fundamentally very wrong in the psychology of people who choose destruction as their primary modus operandi.  If Donald J Trump is reelected rather than blame us look in the mirror and blame yourselves. Because you are the ones that are responsible for the rise of Donald Trump. You are the ones who have created this monster that you so despise by your very actions your refusal to respect your fellow Americans and the things that are important to us.  You have made fun of the fly-over states the people who cling to their guns and religion the middle class factory workers and coal miners and underprivileged rural populations that you dismissively call yahoos and deplorables. You have mocked our faith and our religion. You have mocked our values and our patriotism. You have trampled our flag and insulted our veterans and treated our first responders with contempt and hatred.  You have made environmentalism your religion while trashing every city you have taken responsibility for. You scream from the rooftops about global warming and a green new deal while allowing tens of thousands of homeless people to cover your streets in literal garbage needles and plastic waste without doing a single thing to help them solve the environmental crisis that your failed social policies are creating. But were supposed to put YOU in charge of the environment while gutting our entire economy to institute this plan when you cant even clean up a single city?? You complain  endlessly  yet have failed to solve a single social problem anywhere. In fact all you have done is create more of them.  Weve had enough. We are tired of quietly sitting by and being the silent majority. So dont be surprised when the day comes when we finally respond. And trust me its coming sooner than you might think. And also trust me when I say it wont be pretty. Get ready.  If Donald Trump is reelected it will be because you and your comrades have chosen to trash the police harass law-abiding citizens and go on rampages destroying public property that we have all paid for and you have zero respect for.  If Donald Trump is reelected it will be because we are sick of your complete and utter nonsense and destruction. How does it feel to know that half of this country finds you FAR more despicable than Donald J. Trump the man you consider to be the anti-Christ? Let that sink in. We consider you to be more despicable more dangerous more stupid and more narcissistic than Donald Trump. Maybe allow yourself a few seconds of self-reflection to let that sink in. This election isnt about Donald Trump vs. Joe Biden. This is about Donald Trump vs. YOU.  So if on the morning of November 4 (or more likely December 29 by the time the Supreme Court will weigh in on the mail-in ballot fiasco we are headed towards) if Donald J. Trump is reelected the only people you have to blame is the left-wing media drones and yourselves. You did this. Yep you!""  Time to walk away! BY- ANONYMOUS",political,Facebook
Dear Friends:  Happy Primary Election Day!  It has been an honor and a privilege to serve as your State Representative these last two years. I humbly ask for your vote today so that I can continue the work that I started on Beacon Hill.  When I campaigned two years ago I promised to fight for the things that everyone needs to thrive -- a clean and sustainable environment reliable transportation accessible and affordable healthcare equitable education and a government that works for all.  I am proud of the bills I successfully championed in the House of Representatives from changing the composition of the board that oversees our building-related climate policies to ensuring that our loved ones with a mental health diagnosis can access emergency medication during the pandemic.  I also promised that I would bring people together to solve some of our toughest issues. I led two transportation working groups to address our climate and transportation crises securing a path forward for additional investments in a greener and more reliable infrastructure.  I want to continue representing you and our progressive values on Beacon Hill!  I want to keep working on your behalf to solve the problems faced by our immigrant neighbors and friends of color to advance reproductive justice and to create a single payer healthcare system for the health and well-being of all. I want to keep fighting alongside colleagues to secure the investments that our schools and teachers need to provide the 21st century education our kids deserve. And I want to fight for the investments we need in public health and local infrastructure.  I thank you for your trust and support over these last two years and I hope for your vote today so that I can continue the work on Beacon Hill!,political,Facebook

"Thank you Carolyn Lowe for your endorsement!  ""As elections loom I have been thinking about how fortunate I am to be an educator in a community that fully supports teachers and students; an educator in a district that has high standards and where leaders are passionate about quality education for all. Friendswood ISD has an amazing reputation to uphold thus I am writing to encourage all to vote for the upcoming school board election and to consider Niki Rhodes for FISD School Board Trustee Position 2. Without a doubt I know Niki will continue the positive leadership and growth already in place.  I met Niki Rhodes almost a decade ago when I had the pleasure of teaching her son first grade. That year and every year since Niki has supported me as well as the students in my class with love and a strong and passionate commitment to their education. Each year I long to be an inspiring teacher that makes a lasting change in the life of my students but this desire cant come to fruition without the support of community members such as Niki Rhodes. The job is too big to do alone  a candidate with a heart for FISD the passion to lead other community members the firsthand understanding of the changing and complex needs that students face today and the expertise to equip leaders and teachers to navigate these changes is needed. Niki will do all this in addition to being a positive hands-on leader that works tirelessly to better the education of all students.  If you have not yet decided on a candidate I highly encourage you to vote for Niki Rhodes. It is so important to carefully choose board members who will help strengthen the educational environment which is exactly why I believe Niki Rhodes is the perfect choice. Exercise your right please vote!""  --Carolyn Lowe FISD Teacher",political,Facebook
In case you missed - letter of endorsement from Mayor Rick Wolfe  Dear Residents of East Amwell  I am Rick Wolfe the Mayor of East Amwell Township. I have had the honor of being your Mayor for the past three years and have been a member of our Township Committee for the past five years.  In this Novembers election there is a seat up for election on our five-person Township Committee. Running for that seat are Chris Sobieski who is currently a member of the Township Committee and Jenna Bloom who has been a resident of East Amwell for nearly 15 years.  I am strongly supporting Jenna Bloom to fill that seat and Id like to explain why.  One of the most important things Ive learned while serving as your Mayor is that the vast majority of the residents of East Amwell share certain values. For example we strongly support preserving our farmland open space and breathtaking vistas; and minimizing to the greatest extent practicable development. We are dedicated to protecting the environment and our abundant wildlife. We want our local government to be fiscally responsible open and transparent and readily accessible to and responsive to the needs of our residents. And we want our Township Committee members to share and promote these values.  Having spent the past three years on the Township Committee with Chris Sobieski I can say without reservation that he does not share these important values. In fact his positions often are antithetical to these values.  Chris who is a registered Republican but privately (and sometimes publicly) professes to be a Libertarian believes weve gone too far in preserving our farmland and open space and we should allow development. His campaign is being supported by a family that wants to reduce the minimum lot size in our agricultural district from a ten acre minimum to a five acre minimum in order to make residential development more profitable in East Amwell. Even more disturbing Chris has publicly stated that he wants to bring public water and sewer to East Amwell Township which is necessary to support high-density residential development.  Chris also has stated publicly that in his view our biggest responsibility as a municipality is maintaining the roads. Yet this year he voted against allocating funds to maintain several roads in our Township and sought instead to use your tax dollars for frivolities such as hiring an archivist. When I challenged him regarding this inconsistency at a Township Committee meeting Chris responded that his stance on our budget was part of his political strategy. Thus Chris approaches our budget not with an eye toward fiscal responsibility but rather as a tool to promote his political career.  Shortly after Chris was elected to the Township Committee almost three years ago he was put in charge of revitalizing our Ringoes Village which is plagued with dilapidated houses unkempt landscaping and excessive traffic and speeding. During that period Chris has put forth very little effort on this project and has solved none of the problems in the Village. Moreover to add insult to injury Chris got a speeding ticket while driving through the Village -- which shows that hes part of the problem rather than part of the solution.   Finally Chris is currently trying to stifle the speech of our residents. Specifically he wants to impose very restrictive limits on how long residents can speak at our Township Committee meetings and on what they can discuss. Clearly hes not in favor of an open and transparent local government.  Jenna Bloom on the other hand exemplifies our East Amwell values. For example Jenna believes it is critical that we preserve our farmland and open space maintain the rural nature of East Amwell and protect our environment and wildlife.  As a successful businesswoman Jenna understands fiscal responsibility customer service and the foolishness and danger of using our municipal budget to advance a political strategy.  As the president of St. Peters Lutheran Church the troop leader for two Girl Scout troops a volunteer at the Princeton Child Development Institute (which helps children and adults with autism ) and an active member of the East Amwell Township School PTO Jenna is hardworking compassionate patient and greatly enjoys working with people. Unlike Chris Sobieski Jenna would never consider limiting the free speech rights of our residents. To the contrary her life revolves around listening to and helping people. She epitomizes public service.  If youre still not sure as between Chris and Jenna who is better qualified to serve on our Township Committee consider the following. At a recent Township Committee meeting when I criticized Chris attempt to use our municipal budget to further his political strategy Chris stated: You should be disgusted with yourself. Youre a fifty-something year old man and youre going after a kid.  A kid! Chris is 28 years old. Its scary that he still views himself as a kid.  We dont need a kid on our Township Committee. Rather we need a hardworking qualified and responsible adult who shares our values and who will work to preserve and promote them. That person is Jenna Bloom.  On November 2nd Please Vote for JENNA BLOOM.  Thank you.  Rick Wolfe Mayor East Amwell Township richard.wolfe@friedfrank.com (908) 377.0560,political,Facebook
CLEAN WATERWAYS ACT SB 712: HARRELLS CO-SPONSORSHIP AND SHORTCOMINGS:  While I thank Senator Harrell for co-sponsoring Senate Bill 712 also known as the Clean Waterways Act she seemingly does not appeal to environmentalists criticisms. The vehicle for our Governors water quality proposals related to his Blue-Green Algae Task Force recommendations represents a modest step forward addressing pollution from septic tanks wastewater treatment facilities storm water and biosolids. However this bill does not go far enough in cracking down on pollution sources nor is the funding readily identified.  Of note 50 environmental organizations recognized the shortcomings and for that reason opposed or cautiously supported the bill. The bill fails to address springs polluted by agricultural runoff and waterways contaminated by biosolids a critical component of the water crisis Florida faces. Upon my election I will join environmentalists including the Sierra Club and the1000 Friends of Florida Inc. to focus on working across the aisle to encourage additional legislative progress and correction of the bills flaws.  Corrections to the bill should include new regulations for the agricultural use of fertilizers. Under a revised bill farmers would be required to provide fertilizer records and submit to inspections. Maintaining records of such will assist in determining any harmful effects knowing that farmers may not be solely liable. Pollution will be better controlled by fertilizer companies being transparent about their products through the recurring inspection of farms and adherence to best management practices.  These are only the bare minimum of what we can do to improve our stewardship of Floridas beautiful and unique environment. The most ecologically diverse estuary on the continent deserves to have diverse perspectives that address how we should protect it and as your next State Senator I pledge to do just that.,political,Facebook
Thanks Dick and Gracia for your kind words - I've always had so much respect for you both and it's humbling that you took the time out of your busy lives to write this!  ---------------  To the editor:  We support Mark Willems running for the public office of County Commissioner in District 5.  We have known Mark for four decades. Over those years he helped with remodeling our home; in that process we had conversations about values to live by and personal freedoms this country has given us. We agreed that with those personal freedoms come personal responsibilities including helping make the community in which we live a better place.  His commitment to the health and well being of Carver County is seen through his ongoing willingness to engage on committees the last 15 years that honor both the past and future while always being aware of present opportunities and challenges:  -Carver County Extension Committee and Chairperson -Carver County Planning Commission and Vice Chairperson -Carver County Board of Adjustments and Vice Chairperson -Carver County Township Association Board and Chairperson -Carver County Historical Society Chairperson and Vice Chairperson -Southwest Corridor Coalition Board -Member of the MN Gun Owners Caucus  As a small business owner Mark understands the impact of progress and the need to work together to make wise decisions that will sustain a healthy economy and a healthy environment for all.  We believe Mark is well qualified to be District 5 County Commissioner and has our vote.  Richard and Gracia Hegener Cologne,political,Facebook
Encouraging Others  To donate go to the website above to the contact page and scroll down to donate.  Come to the widow I want to encourage everyone to write to the Attorney Generals office and express your opinion about eviction and the need for Motels to accommodate families. When you need encouragement I would like to tell you about my day the reason is so you can pray for me. I need prayer. I need wisdom discernment things are getting hairy and they are just going to get worse. I read on article yesterday about the poverty level increasing those on the edge have been thrust into poverty those in poverty are now in below extreme poverty. All moratoriums stopped. No protection from eviction utility shut offs the jobs are scarce; the pay is low and no overtime. Unemployment stopped giving the additional $600 which helped so many families unemployment can take up to 6 weeks to even get. Those with homes are losing them; those with temporary homes like here are being evicted. Shelters are full. There is no agreement on any kind of relief.  I started out with several problems already from yesterday; two momss who let me know at the last minute they had no money no place to go.  I received a phone call from I care about a mom of a 4month old baby in a domestic violence situation they are trying to find her a place to go until she gets a paycheck.  Another mom with an at risk 14year old daughter sat in my office at the table and cried she just went back to work and no one will help her we had a difficult heart to heart she was supposed to pay at 11am today she cannot.  The eviction I had to do last week is at the end of her time and frantic and desperate and trying to report me to DSS since I have no children they informed her she was calling the wrong place. These women have been to every church every ministry to no avail. When they are calling me they are truly desperate.  I am about to have to file another eviction today.  It is only 12:30.  We can just close our doors That is something I hear frequently I know if the Lord wants these doors to stay open they will stay open this is where He brought them this is why I have to insure they pay to keep the doors open for those who have nowhere to go. We are coming to a time when we have to be very discerning on who to help and who to let go..nothing is done without much prayer.  Dinner conversation prayer and wishful thinking? I had dinner with my friend Connie last night we do our bible study together and we have great concern for these barley teens and teens wishful thinking was that if we had a home to go to with them we could give them a consistent and Christ like environment to live and learn in. They are at great risk before it is too late.  DSS actually spoke to me about a child I have known and loved for the last 3 years they asked what I could do to help the situation I told them other then take him myself I had done everything I could do they actually said oh you would let him live with you? Honestly I would let about 4 of them live with me if I had a place to put them what they need is Christ a stable environment not fight flight mode all the time love and discipline. Stability dont think these children know all about grown up things like paying bills buying food and many other things they are not in school while their parents are at work they are on their own. There is pain there is panic hurt and desperation all around me and this is something only God can fix. I know He will lead me through and I may not understand everything now I will shed a lot of tears He has a plan I intend to the best of my ability to follow that plan whatever that maybe.  Pray for us all.  Much love Denise,political,Facebook
With the Governor planning to reopen the Schools September 8th and with the crisis situations in our Country we need do everything possible to provide a safe and secure environment for Students Teachers Staff and Families in Jefferson County. There are four steps that should be considered to increase safety and security in our schools. The goal is to decrease a situation where the likelihood of a shooting and the number of children who will be harmed. The steps are really four interconnected pillars: pre-emptive response access control hardening classrooms and on-site incident response.  1. Responding Pre-emptively  In order to pre-emptively stop school violence it is vital to establish an environment that provides solid psychological security. A promising track is to develop relevant and up-to-date forms and modes of Psychological First Aid. Psychological first aid should be a national strategy used as a preventative measure for dealing with more serious psychological trauma. Currently the development of psychological first aid can be highly effective in smaller sample populations such as schools a workplace or a religious or social association and can be put into practice in everyday life.  As it pertains to schools and school-age kids the initial action is to involve the students. Using them as an informational resource can make all subsequent actions more effective. Survey their experiences and then use the information openly (but anonymously) so they can see the follow-through. Additionally put students in as many Leadership positions in the process as possible. This grows them and will provide a wealth of insights that the adults might have missed. All of this will build trust and inclusion that will empower the other pre-emptive actions. The students will be your best source of information. This generation of young people lives in near-constant communication but it is not always transparent to the staff and faculty. Given that there were warning signs before almost all of the recent school shootings (many of which were stopped) making the students a part of this process is a key.  That said these warning signs must provoke immediate action. The majority of the shooters have had some mental health or social interaction issues and people noticed. The Parkland shooter was Flagged multiple times yet no one took action.  This was egregious but not that abnormal. Police and school officials have to respond to red flags on social media or in overheard conversations. This response must be immediate and highly public. That way we can stop what we know about and deter what we dont.  Teachers must follow due process but fear of overstepping ones bounds must not be allowed to obstruct intervention. Worries about giving a student a black mark must be swept aside. Troubled individualsand all those around themare much better served by stopping them from doing something potentially drastic and deadly. Action must be taken before shots are fired if at all possible.  2. Control Access to the School  The second pillar is firmly controlling access to school facilities. If a person does not belong in the school or is attempting to bring in prohibited items such as weapons they must be denied access. Schools must have limited points of entry (one or at most two) each of which should be monitored and controlled by personnel that can turn people away when needed.  School personnel and students must not be able to cheat by opening doors for friends or for parents. Worse yet is opening doors for a stranger just to be nice. Convenience must not be a factor. If a shooter is blocked from entering a school they are unlikely to do much harm or at least a lot less. Controlling access to a school is particularly critical at the beginning and end of the day but also applies during the remainder of the day. The question How did the shooter get in? is always a pivotal one.  How people enter the building and who monitors the access process are a key set of decisions. They must be tailored to each specific school. Too much security or too heavy-handed a footprint can add psychological insecurity to the student body which can do harm even if a shooting never takes place. A balance must be found and maintained. This decision cannot be driven from outside the school. It must be seen as part of the schools central culture. If students see it that waywhich will require research education as to the reasoning and a deft touch with both students and parentsthey will be far more likely to buy into the practice.  3. Hardening the Classroom  Next we must do a better job of securing (or hardening) classrooms as potential targets inside the school. Classrooms are often chosen to shelter-in-place particularly for the youngest kids who are very difficult to move quickly. All classroom doors have windows to allow observation (and protection for the children) but in an active shooter situation this becomes a liability. There needs to be a low-cost fast way of blocking the outside view through the window. Likewise the doors must be lockable from the inside by the doors lock and with some sort of very simple quickly applied additional blocking mechanism.  Within the classroom teachers must be able to provide their students both cover (protection from gunfire) and concealment (a place to hide). The courageous teacher who hid her young pupils in storage cabinets and then faced the gunman in Sandyhook gave her life but her quick thinking saved the children.  There are now bulletproof sanctuaries that can be put inside classrooms and can double as story corners. While these may be beyond the budgets of most schools its a good model to provoke the imagination. We must devise the best cover and concealment we can find.  As a last resort teachers and older kids should also make a determination as to how they might actually fight an attacker with improvised weapons available in the class. The best mode of attack must be specified for each individual classroom grade level and teacher. Teachers should first be briefed or taught by an expert what is expected of them. Then the teachers should devise a specific plan of action for their own classroom. This should be reviewed and if need be adjusted so that it provides the maximum protection and the minimum of psychological insecurity.  Once the plan is approved and set it should be published in writing so it is not just in the teachers head. (Any substitute teacher should be required to review these plans.) Lastly drills should be conducted first with the teacher alone then with adults role-playing as the kids and finally with the actual students. Older kids (high schooler's) can be told what the drills are really for though teachers should characterize them for younger students as something like stranger drills to avoid any unneeded worry.  4. On-Site Incident Response  That leads to pillar No. 4: Schools must have an on-site response capability that can confront and stop an active shooter. Law enforcement will do their best to respond in a timely manner but they will quite often fail. Most active shooter scenarios are done within 3-6 minutes. Few if any police or sheriff departments can promise to respond quickly especially in non-urban areas. How schools achieve this capability is again a delicate decision.  Every school district or individual school should come to this decision themselves. A highly centralized solution is not recommended. The how of achieving an adequate on-site response must once again factor in the school culture. This is clearly the most contentious aspect of school security. There are four main options. (1) A school can have dedicated police assets on campus; which we do in Washington and Jefferson High Schools along with deputies engaged in other schools via direct patrols (2) they can hire private security personnel; (3) or they can seek volunteer security personnel from the community (such as veterans or retired law enforcement).  There are numerous options for schools to attain this on-site capability and communities must choose what they can support both budget-wise and within their collective moral structures. Remember: Too much security can be almost as big a problem as too little so the right solution for each school is critical.  This is about more than just handing out pistols or asking those with concealed carry permits to bring their weapons to work. This will involve protocols for the storage of weapons vetting psych evaluations for those who volunteer and extensive training regimens. The training must include negotiation and de-escalation skills non-lethal control techniques team response drills firearms training and extensive trauma-level first aid.  This all bears emphasis: You must have the correct people as well as the correct training. The firearms training in particular must entail far more than shooting a few dozen rounds at a local range. Shooting in close proximity to non-hostile personnel is the most difficult gun skill to learnit must be trained and drilled until it is ingrained and only attempted in the correct situations. This is particularly essential if we are going to depend on a volunteer- or staff-based response capability.  The fact that certain individuals will actively deter and respond to threats need not lead to culture of fear among the student body. Local schools and communities will be able to develop their own psycho-social infrastructure that is compatible with each individuals preferred form of security.  Some students are more attracted to a physical procedure and therefore will be more likely to respond appropriately based on their training. Likewise those who are attracted to a psychological facilitation can respond positively and rebound more quickly from the trauma of an attack event. Both deterring and facilitating through adequately trained response are necessary to maintain psychological strength and resilience. This is needed both in the event and immediately afterward.  One final note of action. No matter how one of these situations plays out the school and community will be severely traumatized. If a solid base of psychological security has been laid beforehand along with the physical security measures the school and student body have the best chance of weathering the tragedy with the least damage.  Strong follow-up support must begin as soon as the site is secured and it must continue until every need is met. If the young people know the counseling department well from pre-existing relationships this can go relatively quickly. Bringing in strangers may be needed but it not optimal. School districts are better served if the counseling department is well and professionally staffed long before any event occurs.  These four steps (and the follow-up) will not guarantee 100 percent safety in our schools but they will materially increase that security through deterrence strong defense measures and adeptness in ending the situation as quickly as possible and returning to normality as swiftly as possible.  These are not pie-in-the-sky ideas. They are already being applied in schools across America. It is time to apply them in all our schools.,political,Facebook

I want to thank my opponent for keeping this campaign about the issues our values and our qualifications. I appreciate his service to the community and in no way do I mean anything I post to demean that service.  We both have a history of public service dating back many years. Our law enforcement careers followed a similar path but only to a point.  To state the obvious differences he has 13 years experience serving on the school board including time as chairman and that cannot be discounted. But for whatever reason he chose to follow a different path than I in his law enforcement career. He chose not to seek supervisory or managerial positions whereas I have continuously sought new roles and responsibilities. I have been promoted through the ranks to my current role as the patrol supervisor. The positions he has held: officer detective field training officer hostage negotiator gang investigator I have either held and/or supervised. Like him I also have supervisory experience in another career field as I spent seven years as a communications technician and for a good portion of that time I was an assistant manager.  I am also proud of my education as my BS degree was earned while working fulltime and fulfilling all the responsibilities of being a husband and a father to two kids.  I began making plans to retire before David Maples announced he would not seek a second term as Sheriff. Retiring from one job did not mean I was ready to call it quits totally and I was excited when this opportunity presented itself. It gives me the prospect of staying connected to law enforcement and the community. To continue to serve the citizens of Bristol. It is a chance to gain new experiences. An opportunity to put all the leadership training and experience I have to work in a different environment. I look at this not as a culmination of a career but rather as the start of a new one.  If you want to know how I will be as a Sheriff ask one of the former ones. Or ask some of the current or former Sheriffs Office employees who know me well. Better yet ask some of the people who I work with currently. I say that unabashedly and with no doubt they will tell you exactly what it will be like. I believe in mentoring employees giving them the training they need to do their job with confidence and then getting out of their way and letting them do it.  I agree with my opponent micro-management is detrimental to moral efficiency and effectiveness. Teamwork is important and equally important is individual performance. One does not exist without the other in this line of work. You must be able to trust your employees to always act responsibly and professionally. Fostering a sense of pride in their job and their position helps. Mentoring training and accountability are the tools that ensure it happens consistently.  Ive not made any decisions on who will comprise my command staff. I expect to pick the most competent knowledgeable and hard-working current employees to fill those positions and I have already told them that. I will just like my opponent rely on those people to run the day-to-day functions of the office. As I gain experience working with them and they with me I expect we will learn to trust each other and my intrusion into the operations side of things will be minimal.  We will celebrate their successes and we will learn from their failures as any good leader knows failure is an inevitable part of the process of learning new responsibilities. Ultimately I see their success or failure as my responsibility. I believe in Jocko Willinks principle of Extreme Ownership.  Ultimately all this is in your hands. First and foremost you must cast your vote. I hope that vote will be cast in my favor. If that isn't the case I hope you consider my qualifications my stated values and my position on the issues you deem important before you make your final determination. I believe if you the voter take a look you will agree I have the right experience training and skills set to do the best job for you. If you are unclear on anything I have written or I haven't answered a question you may have please reach out.  With very few exceptions the words written on this page are being put here by me.

To Whom it may Concern  I am a graduate of Connetquot class of 1991 a teacher since 1998 and teaching at Connetquot since 2001. Currently I teach three different science courses AP Biology Honors Living Environment and Forensic Chemistry. I always have taken pride in the fact that I graduated from Connetquot and now I am part of the faculty. However the superintendentss decision to basically disregard all the work that my colleagues and others put into developing a sound educational plan for this school year has me feeling less than proud to say the least. Live-streaming the smart board during class is wrong on many levels.  We teachers work hard to prepare engaging personal lessons that are not meant for broadcast. Teachers are not actors and our lessons vary from class to class based upon student interaction. Teaching does not have an exact script and when you view a screen and not the people there is a lot that will be missed. Lessons are our personal intellectual property and live streaming will enable these lessons to be recorded on other devices and used for other purposes.  We also cannot forget that these are not adults we are educating. They are teens who sometimes make poor decisions. They might think its funny to record the voice of another student during the lesson and post it all over social media. This is not only mean but a form of cyber bullying. They may decide to record the live stream on another device and voice over the actual lesson making it appear as if the teacher is cursing or some other creative way to portray the teacher in a negative light. Once again they then can post it all over social media. Instances like these have already been done.  Now lets talk about the quality of this livestream experience. Who decides which cohort gets to do the fun interactive activity while the at home cohort gets to listen to it? How do we even know if students are actually watching and engaged while at home? They could just log in and then play video games or sleep while class is going on. These are teenagers whose parents may be at work. Left to their own devices they may make poor decisions and do nothing during these livestreams. How do we hold them accountable? In addition we cannot forget about students who will be all virtual. How is listening in on daily lessons the equivalent of actually being present? It is not! One thing we have learned from the end of last year is that virtual classrooms have to be different from in person to ensure that students are actually learning. We would need to differentiate instruction as well as testing for these at home virtual learners.  Speaking of testing how is that going to be fair? Some students have to take tests in class and others online. Those that are online can look up answers or ask a parent or friend. Are we going to repeat the grading debacle from last year? Yes I said debacle because multiple changes were made regarding grading from March through June. How do you expect to get a real grade when students as well as teachers cant be assured your system doesnt change multiple times on the fly. I noticed that the new plan has not once mentioned grading which leads me to believe it will be up for discussion throughout the year. This is a disservice to our students as well as our faculty.  These are just a few of the problems I foresee with the new plan that the superintendent released. We teachers want a safe learning environment for all our students as well as ourselves. Please help us stand up for our students and sound educational practices. Tell your superintendent to allow those of us who are actually educating the children to be a part of the plan.

Confused about the facts about Measure K? Please read and share our letter to the editor that didn't make it into this week's paper.  Dear Editor:  As a member of the OUSD school board I am writing in response to Mr. Daddis letter of Oct. 2. Im happy to see that Mr. Daddi is supportive of the district's work including a focus on academic improvement and the development of innovative magnet programs. This work is critical both to our students and our community and is a reason to support not oppose Measure K.  If we want to be like Oak Park as Mr. Daddi seems to say we need community support. The Oak Park community supports their school with a bond rate of $146 compared to our current $36 rate per $100000 of assessed value. Also worth noting: Oak Park has the lowest number of socio-economically disadvantaged students in the county compared to our rate of more than 50%. We know that helping these students to achieve takes more resources. Community support is crucial to quality schools.  Mr. Daddis assertion that the Measure K bond will not improve the education in this district is simply wrong. Right now every facility emergency costs education dollars to remedy. The bond will provide cost savings on maintaining old and failing infrastructure. By modernizing our classrooms and completing deferred maintenance projects it will save money not only on maintenance costs but on our month over month expenses as well. Adding solar can cut our energy costs. Installing turf on our fields lowers our water consumption. These improvements will not only benefit our environment they will free up money for classrooms and the very programs for which Mr. Daddi is advocating.  Finally Measure K doesnt just help our schools it helps our community. With Measure K funds we will finally be able to take advantage of the lowest interest rates in memory to replace our 60 year-old pool with an aquatics center available for community use.  Our kids deserve school facilities that work. Show our students that they matter. A vote for Measure K is a vote for not only the future of our kids but also of our community. Vote Yes on Measure K.

How To Fix Education In Colorado  We all know that K-12 education in Colorado is facing a lot of challenges not the least of which is the reduction in support from the State budget. So what can be done to help mitigate the loss of dollars on the education of Colorados children?  From 2011-12 to 2018-19 average per pupil spending increased 25.5%. My opponent Chris Hansen supports amending TABOR to increase your taxes and spend more money on public education doing more of the same things. As Albert Einstein is widely credited with saying The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again but expecting different results. This lack of imagination is why our educational system is failing our students. I have been a school board president and have seen first-hand what works and what doesnt. Hansens proposal wont work. I have better solutions.  Parents know their childs educational needs learning styles social skills and special needs if any better than any legislator. For some children the traditional public-school system is the ideal educational environment. For others it is a charter school. Some learn better in a private or parochial school or perhaps through home schooling. I do not believe we ask Coloradans for $9 billion in state and local taxes simply to fund our public schools. I believe we ask our citizens for their hard-earned dollars to educate our children. There is a big difference between these two ideas. We must provide parents full educational choice that is financially supported by the State of Colorado. The recent Supreme Court decision nullifying the Blaine amendment eliminates a major hurdle to achieving this. Now Coloradans need to elect legislators who will fight for each parents right to decide how to educate their child.  We must also empower local control of our school systems and reduce the authority of the State Department of Education. Today the General Assembly passes laws mandating new programs and placing additional responsibilities on our local public schools. The elected State Board of Education then promulgates new rules guidelines reports and oversight on our local public schools to implement these new laws. The locally elected Boards of Education then have to implement these new rules guidelines reports and develop procedures to comply with the new oversight requirements. Throughout this process not a single student is being taught. Education happens in the classroom and most importantly it happens in the home. Every rule guideline decision and dollar spent should as directly as possible support children in the classroom and support parents in guiding their childrens education. Instead the current system has resulted in the number of principals & assistant principals increasing 3.7x faster with the number of superintendents assistant superintendents and directors increasing 2.4x faster than the number of students from 2011-12 to 2018-19. This requires an excessive allocation of limited budget dollars to administrative costs rather than to the education of our children. The focus SHOULD and MUST always be on the children.  In conjunction with empowering local control of our school systems we must get the General Assembly out of the business of micro-managing education. During the 2019 session they passed 45 bills relating to K-12 education including adding 17 new programs and 5 new curriculum requirements. Even in the challenging 2020 session 24 bills relating to K-12 education were passed. In fact on June 10 HB20-1336 was passed (with a Yes vote from Hansen) establishing an additional requirement as a condition of high school graduation. This was 3 weeks AFTER the Public School Finance bill was sent to the Governor for signature. Instead of helping schools manage the reduction in state funding the General Assembly is requiring our schools to do EVEN MORE with LESS money!  You deserve a Senator who understands how to efficiently and effectively educate the children of Colorado in the most cost-effective manner possible  for your children for you as parents and for our taxpayers.

"I get a lot of questions about what a county commissioner does. Below is information I have copied from the Ohio County Commissioners handbook. Great info on roles and responsibilities.  ""A. Board of County Commissioners - ORC Chapters 305 and 307 All Ohio counties organized under the general statutory law have three county commissioners two being elected at the time of the presidential election and one at the time of the gubernatorial election. The county commissioner elected at the gubernatorial election takes office on January 1st and the two elected at the presidential election take office on January 2nd and 3rd. Candidates for these two commissioner positions must file for either the January 2 or 3 position (ORC 305.01).  The organizational meeting of the board of county commissioners occurs on the second Monday of January each year by the election of one of its members as president (ORC 305.05). The commission must hold 50 regular meetings per year (ORC 305.06) and as many special meetings as necessary to conduct their business (ORC 305.07). County commissioners make up the general administrative body for county government.  As indicated above they can perform those duties which are specifically authorized by the General Assembly and no more. They are the county government taxing budgeting appropriating and purchasing authority. They hold title to county property. Individual commissioners have no power to act independently. All formal and official actions must be taken by the board of county commissioners acting as a body by majority or unanimous vote. Commissioners also have a myriad of other responsibilities including hearing and ruling on annexations approving drainage improvements through the petition ditch process establishing water and sewer districts and making improvements and providing for solid waste disposal.  Commissioners also appoint department heads of offices for which they have responsibility and also appoint members to a variety of boards and commissions and also serve on some boards such as the board of revision the county records commission and the planning commission. Commissioners must work with all other county elected officials and with judges to assure that they are properly funded to perform their statutory duties. But it is the non-statutory duties of county commissioners that make them different from other county elected officials. By necessity county commissioners must take a broad view of actions necessary to make the county a better place to live and work. Many commissioners are thus active in promoting public/private partnerships in human services economic development health and infrastructure development. Other commissioners take an active role in improving the environment promoting job training programs and improving agriculture in their counties.  County commissioners must be astute and have good business sense. Perhaps the most important attribute of a county commissioner is the ability to lead to listen to the needs of the citizens and other elected officials to compromise and to develop a consensus on priority issues to improve the county.""",political,Facebook
TIME TO PIVOT #BodyCams4StPetePD is evolving with the times.  #BodyCams4StPetePD has been advocating for police accountability for over a year now by demanding every SPPD police officer wear bodycams when dealing with the public. It has not been easy! During this time of advocacy many related issues became apparent: The school to prison pipeline. The for-profit jail and prison systems. The negative influence of the police union. The police state that reinforces white supremacy everywhere. The indifference of black leaders that benefit from a bad system. The silence and complacency of our local paper. Its not all bad news. I adapted overcame and forged on. I read every nasty correspondence as I read all supportive emails. I drew resiliency from the hate mail as I got inspired by the love mail. I chose to take on the abusive system not because it was a safe and popular position but because it was right. Now its time for my movement to pivot and expand. Being forward-thinking and able to anticipate the future in order to stay with the times is part of what we do. Someone asked me once on here What does #BodyCams4StPetePD have to do with the school system? That is a valid question but only if you dont know that police officers are called to deal with kids as young as 5 that are misbehaving in our school system and that there is no limit on the age that a child can be arrested. I seek to emphasize the options of spending on school today or spending on incarceration later. They asked as well How can #BodyCams4StPetePD prevent systemic racism? This one is obvious Our Police Departments of today derived from a Jim Crow era and are used as an instrument of oppression by some not all to keep minorities in bondage and in a state of despair. Only video evidence with sound can shed light on this dark practice of policing by some. At last they asked Why is #BodyCams4StPetePD calling out our leaders and our local paper to account when they are powerless against the current environment? To this I say: nothing happens in a bubble. Everyone every entity religious non-religious democrats republicans and independents alike. We all have a role to play to bring about the necessary change in our county city and community by changing the way we view and practice law enforcement. We all have a duty of care towards our public institutions of school public service and public office. I see fair and balanced journalism as the last tool of redemption for our democracy. In that sense #BodyCams4StPetePD ceased to be a simple electronic device but a way of life to call to account every one of us and speak truth to power wherever it resides in our county and in whatever form it takes.  BODYCAMS is now synonymous to ACCOUNTABILITY! Accountability Has Everything To Do With Our Life Liberty And The Pursuit Of Happiness.  Having realized that I am expanding my demand for BodyCams to reach every police department within Pinellas including the Pinellas County Sheriffs Office. Our advocacy efforts will call to account clear attempts by our local paper to circumvent our democratic system and hold few worthy to govern regardless of the current facts. When our elected leaders are turning a blind eye to abuses we will be there to shed light on the circumstances. I am keeping #BodyCams4StPetePD to advocate in my city of St. Petersburg while I create the new #BodyCams4Pinellas to advocate for accountability countywide. Please join me in this evolution of modern accountability based on access to social media as a means to balance the equation of Truth and Justice.

Below is the letter I wrote to the Yolo County Elections Office upon learning that there were NO planned Voter Assistance Centers in South Davis for the upcoming November 3rd election. I am very pleased that the Elections Office has now confirmed that there will be a Voter Assistance Center at Marguerite Montgomery Elementary School! Thank you Yolo County Elections Office for ensuring that the residents of South Davis can get the support they need in this very important election.  To Whom It May Concern  My name is Josh Chapman and Ive been a South Davis resident for the past 10 years. Im also running for City Council in District 5 South Davis. I received an email from Katherine Campos regarding the proposed locations for Voter Assistance Centers (VACs) and the Ballot Drop-Off Boxes (BDB). I would like to convey my utmost concern with the proposed locations. Specifically I am concerned about the lack of VACs in South Davis and the inconsistency in purposes between VACs and BDBs which could lead to voter confusion.  The currently proposed locations for VACs are NOT ideal for a South Davis voter and may actually discourage voting. The proposed VACs are positioned in West Davis (Orchard Rd Shasta Drive) and Central Davis (E. 14th St). The only VAC that is even remotely close to some residents in South Davis is the Harper Junior High School (Covell Blvd) location. This location presents challenges to residents of South Davis who need assistance with the voting process or need to vote in person. The Harper VAC location presents transportation barriers as well as unfamiliarity to South Davis residents trying to access this support. South Davis has a disproportionate population of residents in the lower socio-economic strata of Davis and not providing them with a location to vote in person that is walkable or easy to access could potentially lead to voter suppression.  Marguerite Montgomery Elementary (MME) School has a large multi-purpose room (which for years has served as a polling place) as well as a large parking lot that could be utilized for voting. Additionally the Yolo County Elections Office could explore the possibility of using the Library on the MME campus. If for some reason that location is not available then Pioneer Elementary School could serve as a second VAC site.  Also I strongly encourage the Yolo County Elections Office to consider having VACs and BDB at the SAME location so there is less confusion on where to go for which services. Having different locations for the VACs and BDB can be confusing to residents and we should be trying to reduce roadblocks to voting. I understand that the BDB and VACs have different dates that they are open and this could present a challenge but providing ONE site for all services would be ideal.  I did receive a response to my initial inquiry and was informed that MME wasnt an option due to COVID-19 constraints. I would like to know what those constraints are and how Patwin Elementary and others on the initial list provide a safer environment than similar options in South Davis.  Thank you for your time and consideration and I look forward to hearing back from you soon.  Regards- Josh Chapman,political,Facebook

"Greetings Citizens of Allegheny Township! In this post I will address my work on the first of the five planks in my re-election platform: ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT!  From 1993 until its dissolution in 2013 I served on the board of the StrongLand Chamber of Commerce. A major focus of StrongLand was bringing commerce to our region and making sure we had an educated citizenry to meet the needs of new businesses. We worked to stop of flow of young people out of our region. I proudly served as board president in 1996. Then WEDIG Westmoreland Economic Development Initiative for Growth took up the cause. I served on that board until it was interrupted by COVID-19. Simultaneously I served on the the Westmoreland County Planning Commission two-year work study with eleven municipalities in our northern part of the county. The whole county is facing the same problem we have in Allegheny Township. The goal was to find ways we can improve life for our people economically and financially and discover opportunities for working together. That work was finalized in the fall of 2020. The final plan is called Remaking Our Westmoreland. You can review the final document by googling ""Remaking Our Westmoreland"". Briefly outcomes of the study that specifically address economic development are: 1. Establish criteria and develop and maintain a listing of development ready sites and work with local business and civic leaders to market these properties. 2. Remove barriers to development by standardizing and streamlining the development process. 3. Develop a master plan for vacant or aging commercial properties. 4. Establish guidelines for beautification including landscaping lighting and facades. Since my family owns and operates four businesses right here in Allegheny Township it is vitally important to me that we work hard together with our surrounding municipalities to improve the business environment and not just give lip service to it. The complete upgrade of the western end of Route 356 is a giant step toward our commercial success. And that is thanks to our constant lobbying to PennDOT to get on the Transportation Improvement Plan and now finally the Construction Plan! Finally the one-square mile Towne Center Zone in the heart of our township was formed specifically to give businesses easy access to infrastructure and permitting needs. Specifics on my other four planks will follow on future posts.  Kathryn Starr",political,Facebook

GREEN TAXES Polluters should be held accountable for their degradation of the public resources. Any business that can't fully account for the cost of not polluting the environment or cleaning up the environment when it does pollute should not be profiting off of their practices that are shifting the responsibility of cleaning up their mess onto future public budgets. The greater the pollution and adverse environmental impact the greater taxes industries should pay to develop revenue with which the public is going to have available to clean up their mess with. The more industries invest in preventing pollution and emissions and fully cleaning up their waste responsibly the more they should be awarded with tax incentives. Tax policy should represent a system of penalties and rewards directly proportional to the public harm or good resulting from an industry's operating practices.,political,Facebook
"I believe that every life is precious and that we are truly created in God's image. That's why I have always been proud to be pro-life and pro-first responder. We should mourn any loss of life be it from COVID-19 influenza heart disease homicide suicide or accident. We should also appreciate those dedicated to saving lives be it healthcare workers or our first responders in law enforcement fire and rescue. Protecting innocent life is one of the most noble careers imaginable and it's a core role of any civilized society. But what happens when the pursuit of ""public health"" starts to possibly do more harm than good to a society?  It has now been five months since Texas and the nation were first asked to make sacrifices for ""three weeks to flatten the curve. Those first weeks have now turned into six months. We have watched for half a year as COVID-19 has been cited as a reason to shut down our economy disrupt millions of lives and limit our liberties.  Followers of this page have seen my concerns and questions grow as more data has become available. The COVID-19 data we are shown has been unreliable at best but we have been assured that government agencies and local health departments are working to clear up backlogs and true-up the numbers.  Last weekend the CDC posted that only 6% of our nation's COVID-19 deaths were caused exclusively from the virus meaning that 94% were deaths with additional factors such as diabetes or heart disease. In fact the average co-morbidity factor is 2.6 for underlying conditions in those who have died meaning there are more than one additional (non-COVID-19) causes for the death. This is alarming news especially when combined with other questions about the reliability of testing and the calculation of positivity rates.  It is time to refocus on the vulnerable populations who are at serious risk from COVID-19 and let others live their life to its fullest potential. This pandemic has eagerly been used by some as a way to ""reset"" and ""reimagine"" our society or inflict unnecessary pain to impact a November election. The restrictions of the several months are perhaps the most devastating policy initiatives in our lifetime.  I am encouraged to report that beginning next Tuesday 69 of the 70 school districts that I represent in Senate District 18 will be open for traditional in-person face-to-face instruction with 66 of those districts already having been opened at last week or more. We should thank the staff administrators school boards and especially the teachers for their hard work and dedicated effort to return a sense of normalcy to our children's learning environment.  Today it seems as if fear and misinformation are more threatening to our world than COVID-19 itself ever was. We must move on from the panic that has paralyzed so much of our society. Let's take the measures needed to protect our vulnerable populations but let's also find a real way to allow people to visit their loved ones in nursing homes assisted living facilities and state supported living centers. Let's acknowledge that every business is essential to someone and reevaluate the effectiveness of so-called lockdowns.  Its time that we live in a free society again as the US Constitution envisioned. We can coexist with COVID-19 and return to a world of liberty prosperity faith and family but only if the ongoing response and restrictions have not destroyed all we hold dear. We can work together to find solutions using common sense. We simply need faith to triumph over fear right now because bad data and undue panic only lead to bad decisions. We will find a way forward because we are Texans and we are indeed created in God's image. And no mask or virus can ever hide that truth.",political,Facebook
To Whom it May Concern:  Im an AP teacher at the High School. When schools closed in March and we all went home my colleagues and I worked really hard to develop the very best materials we could to help deliver instruction. Our resources grew over time as did our skills at utilizing them. It was a whole new world. I was fortunate to have some experience with the digital tools I needed but for many teachers it was a struggle: trying to learn new software raising their own children and sorting through the overload of information that came to us each day. While I know that not all parents were happy with what their children experienced I hope that they know we were working hard and doing our best.  As we began discussions with the district about what the Fall would look like I was encouraged by the cooperative approach taken by the Assistant Superintendent for Curriculum and Instruction who chaired our committee. Together with teacher representatives from all levels Department Directors and Building Principals we began to reimagine what our schools could be. We did not at the time know what message the Governor would give about whether schools would be open in September so our task was multifaceted.  In the case where schools were to remain closed we quickly came up with a 100% Remote Learning plan that would simulate a school-day. There would be (asynchronous) pre-recorded lessons that students could view (and re-view as needed) there would be (synchronous) live lessons where teachers could work with the whole class and/or with small groups of students and there would be times for individual students and teachers to connect in an office hours model. Is remote learning ideal? Of course not. We were however sure that we would be able to provide a quality education with the students as active learners.  There are of course MANY problems with returning to our school buildings during this pandemic. Unfortunately this took up a lot of time and energy at our meetings. There are so very many questions: Could we clean shared spaces frequently enough? How could kids safely use the restrooms? How could we maintain social distancing in the hallways? What is a mask break and how can we do them safely? What does art look like with no shared materials? How long will it take for a kindergarten class to all wash their hands before and after lunch? And so on... There are no easy answers. It became apparent that the district would be able to maintain only the minimum health and safety standards put out by the State Departments of Health and Education. There will still be serious risk of spreading the virus in every scenario.  With the health risks always on our minds the committee members put our heads together (with masks and social distance of course) to come up with an in-person plan. We had the basics figured out pretty well:  - K-3 needed special consideration so we drafted a plan that would utilize as much available staff and space to get them all in classes with teachers all day. Specials could push-in to the classroom to minimize the childrens exposure to other groups of students.  - Grades 4-5 are a little bit more independent so our plan put them with their teacher for half the day in AM/PM groups. (By using so much staff and space for K-3 we were limited for the rest of the elementary grades.) The other half of the day would be specials and TA led reinforcement.  - Secondary was a little more complex to figure out. The space available would limit the capacity. Wed have to split the students and have only half of them in the building at any given time. Middle School grades can be cohorted so that they dont change classrooms more than a couple of times each day. But at the High School student schedules are so unique that this would not be possible. We did not want to eliminate the many wonderful educational opportunities that our elective programs offer so we had to think really hard about what we could do. We drew inspiration from the Flipped Classroom model. It has been catching on around the world over the years. In this model the students view pre-recorded lessons and material at home and the in-class time is used to reinforce clarify apply discuss and assess. This model would allow us to shorten the class periods (to help with longer transportation times longer class change times and more preparation time) keep the students as active learners and still provide a quality education. To be honest this plan terrified me. While I was (and am still) convinced that it would be best for students education it would be A LOT of work for teachers. I was not looking forward to the workload or to convincing my colleagues that it would be worth it.  And thats where our committee last stood. We had some great concepts but still needed to negotiate many details to make it work. The main obstacles to overcome were providing adequate time for teacher preparation and figuring out how to maintain a sanitary environment for everyone. We had not yet discussed creating a remote-only option for families but we had floated the idea of matching those students with teachers to create such a system. The committee scheduled a meeting to continue our discussions.  In the week that elapsed before the next meeting was to occur the Superintendent threw away our collaborative work and published her own plan. Her plan calls for live-streaming lessons from the secondary classroom for every teacher and class. Instead of the flipped classroom concept this would revert all secondary teachers to the old chalk and talk approach that is widely viewed as archaic and less effective. In the Superintendents model students would be able to attend the class from home but ALL STUDENTS would be passive learners. This plan provides very limited time for teachers to interact with at-home students. Students not present in the classroom will only be able to ask questions via email (which would be answered within 48 hours) and extra help would be during a teachers professional period. If a student has another class scheduled during the professional period then such extra help would not be possible for him or her.  If we broadcast our classrooms live as the Superintendent demands we face a multitude of problems for the childrens education:  - Participation in class would not be possible for any at-home students (this includes HALF of the student population on any day as well as all remote-only students).  - Participation in class would be hindered for in-class students because theyll know that they are being recorded and broadcast.  - Privacy of IEP students 504 students and any other students with special accommodations would be in jeopardy.  - Lessons will be stilted: canned scripts will be chosen by teachers for fear of saying the wrong thing while parents are watching.  - If a teacher is absent there will be no lesson to broadcast but attendance would still be mandatory for students. Extra Help will be the only time for at-home students to interact with the teacher. (Remember: half the students are at-home every day.)  - Students opting for remote-only will not be able to view lessons/materials on their own schedule.  I have endeavored thus far to stay focused on the education of the students. I have not yet delved into the many other problems that the Superintendents live-streaming plan presents. I hope that you realize that even though I am a union officer my first thoughts are of the education of our children.  There are technology problems that will prevent the district from starting the school year on time or running successfully:  - The district does not have the equipment. What cameras are to be used? What microphones?  - The district does not have the staff. Do we have a new Director of Technology? The Technology staff is severely overwhelmed in a normal school year so how can they be expected to set up every classroom in such a short amount of time?  - Are Chromebooks available for all students that need them?  - Can the students at home actually SEE and HEAR the lesson as the teacher intends it?  There are real teacher fears:  - Are parents judging every word the teacher says?  - What if a teacher makes a mistake? Will he or she be publicly shamed?  - Are parents comparing a teachers 5th period lesson to his or her 1st period lesson?  - Are students misbehaving on camera in a way that reflects badly on the teacher?  - Is someone recording a lesson and stealing it?  - Is someone doctoring a recording of a lesson and publishing it to make the teacher or school look bad?  - Is someone using a recording of a teacher out of context in a way that makes the teacher or school look bad?  - Who owns recordings of a teacher?  - When are teachers going to be trained on any new equipment?  I mentioned that I was terrified of the plan that I helped to develop and that I supported but that was because I was going to have to work really hard and stretch my technological abilities to the max. Im terrified of the Superintendents plan for more serious reasons: I become very vulnerable. My livelihood is on the line AND IM NOT ABLE TO DO MY JOB TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY. While the Superintendents plan for live-streaming would be significantly less work for me than creating digital lessons every day it still scares me more. And for what? What is the benefit to students? I have yet to hear what they are.  In closing I am not looking for the district to definitively adopt one plan or another. I am looking for the district to come back to the table and develop a plan that works for everyone. I know that the district has the legal right to force live-streaming but if the Superintendent truly cares about educating our students she will come to the table and talk about this with the rest of the players: teachers TAs administrators custodial staff clerical staff food service staff etc. EVERYONE should be a part of the process. The Superintendents behavior is reprehensible and the Board of Education should find a way to get her out of our district so they can hire someone that cares about education and knows how to bring people together.

"""Whoso loveth instruction loveth knowledge: but he that hateth ---reproof is brutish. "" - -Proverbs 12:1  ""Turn you at my ---reproof: behold--- I will pour out my spirit unto you--- I will make known my words unto you----.  Because I have called and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand and no man regarded; But ye have set at nought all my counsel and would none of my ---reproof:  I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh; When your fear cometh as desolation and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.  Then shall they call upon me but I will not answer; they shall seek me early but they shall not find me: For that they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the LORD:  They would none of my counsel: they despised all my --reproof. Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way and be filled with their own devices. For the turning away of the simple shall slay them and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.  But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely and shall be quiet from fear of evil.""  -Proverbs 1:23-33  ------------------------- Reproof/Correction --------------------------  Who amongst us likes to be corrected? It could be a private word of caution or a public embarrassment/shaming when our view of things as they are -- is challenged by an alternative opinion -- or worse still by the true facts? How well do we take being told we are wrong?  Generallyas a species not very well ... and our behaviour often mirrors the 5 stages of grief ... Denial anger bargaining depression and finally grudging acceptance.  The severity of our reaction is usually related to the issue or topic that is being discussed -- deeply held world-views religious convictions political/policy positions etc. will elicit a stronger response than being told we are wrong about the singer/title of a song or the upcoming weather forecast!  Sometimes we will accept being wrong if the corrector is a person we respect or an eminent authority in their field. Usually such correction is accompanied by a gentle statement of why it is that our position is incorrect and the facts that point to a correct assessment of the particular question or issue.  To pick on some immediate hot buttons -- the legitimacy of the recent US presidential election or the ongoing debate about vaccination or vaccines. There is absolutely nothing wrong in challenging the results of the first or debating the merits of the latter -- but the question is --- how prepared are we to actually confront the facts? Are we willing to be persuaded or have we already made up our mind and new data is as good as irrelevant to us?  Our opening text from Proverbs puts the words ""instruction"" and ""reproof"" alongside each other as being closely related. Being willing to admit you are wrong is the first step towards increasing your knowledge of what is RIGHT! Unwillingness to listen to correction is likened to being like a dumb and stupid animal...(that is what the word brutish means in the Word don't get mad at --us :-) ) .... not a human being made in the image of God!  The REPROOF of the LORD is expressed in His Word to a variety of people.  The best example --- In the Book of Jonah the LORD through the prophet Jonah spoke to a gentile nation (the Assyrians at Nineveh) to tell them to turn from their ways. They listened and turned --- and the LORD spared them from destruction.  The nation of Israel exhibited very different behavior. Time after time the LORD sent prophets to tell them to turn from their ways but they rejected their word for the most part. Finally they ended up being accomplices to the preordained death of their own Messiah ... one who wished to gather them as a hen gathers her chicks but they would NOT!  The response of the LORD (our second text) is chilling in the extreme .... He just stays out of their lives! They get what every animal gets ...air water food clothing shelter --- even prosperity --- but they are out of the covering of God's Grace and Favor and left to deal with the consequences of their own actions. Brrr.... we don't want that!!!!  Worse when they cry out to God to deliver them from the messes of their own making He says --- "" I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh; When your fear cometh as desolation and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.""  You may say that doesn't sound like a very loving God and it doesn't --- it sounds like a JUST God that treats this kind of people they way they treated Him! You mock and laugh at Him today what legs do you have to stand on when HE does the same to you??  All He is asking is to LISTEN TO HIM so He can show you how to live a happy and healthy life! His REPROOF is for our BENEFIT... and not because He takes pleasure in making people toe HIs arbitrary lines. The 10 commandments and Christ's summary (""Love God Love your neighbor"") are --the--- way to a happy and healthy social environment and culture!  We are seeing the results of the shipwreck of our value system. Belief in lies avoiding the truth hating our neighbors leading immoral lives --- there is a social cost (homelessness broken homes abortions youth suicides drug abuse etc. etc.) -- and a personal cost -- pain and suffering for all the humans that are trapped in this kind of society. It doesn't need to be that way... if we would only listen to what He is telling us!  If you would be wise if you want to live in peace and safety be delivered from the fear of evil --- make the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob your refuge... listen to His SON the incarnate Word of God and His words of chastisement rebuke and correction.  ""My son despise not thou the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him: For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.  If ye endure chastening God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not? But if ye be without chastisement whereof all are partakers then are ye bastards and not sons.  Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits and live? For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit that we might be partakers of his holiness.  Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.""  - Hebrews 12:5-11  Admitting we are wrong is the hardest thing to do. It requires intellectual courage moral honesty and a willingness to examine the facts without bias to get to the TRUTH -- but -- if we are willing to do it --- a whole world of peace and happiness is just waiting to be unfolded for us!!!  "" Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble knees; And make straight paths for your feet lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed. Follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the Lord: Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled;  Lest there be any fornicator or profane person as Esau who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright. For ye know how that afterward when he would have inherited the blessing he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance though he sought it carefully with tears.  For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched and that burned with fire nor unto blackness and darkness and tempest And the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words; which voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more: (For they could not endure that which was commanded And if so much as a beast touch the mountain it shall be stoned or thrust through with a dart: And so terrible was the sight that Moses said I exceedingly fear and quake:)  But ye are come unto mount Sion and unto the city of the living God the heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angelsTo the general assembly and church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to God the Judge of all and to the spirits of ---just men--- ---made--- ---perfect--- And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel.

"My position on different topics ""No on Prop16"" Silicon Valley jobs Safer Neighborhood Immigration Healthcare Infrastructure and Climate Change. Below is a summary for you.  I strongly oppose Prop 16! Vote No on Prop16! Prop 16 proposes UC admissions public jobs and contracts based on the racial mix of California. It will HURT your kids education and jobs.  My opponent Ro Khanna supports Prop-16 a race-based quota system! Can we trust him? He signed a pledge in 2014 not to support Prop16 type laws but has flipped to achieve his political ambitions?  Instead  I support a substantial reform in K-12 education system with more school choices increased use of technology better college prep courses and greater teacher accountability.  I support better vocational training programs to encourage better wage growth for semi-skilled workers. Vote No on Prop16.  Silicon Valley Jobs for the next century: A Bio-Silicon Valley Concept  Propose lower tax rate for start up employees for a period to encourage innovation and reward hard work.  Promote higher wage growth for employees by attaching corporate tax incentives tied to wage levels.  Reinstate SALT tax deductions and promote lesser property taxes for California to encourage housing affordability.  Incentives to set up manufacturing locally and in the US.  Support police reforms for safer neighborhoods  I support reforming police procedures better sensitivity training and greater community interaction with the police. I support secure borders and a strong military. o My opponent Ro Khanna wants to defund Police abolish ICE let criminal illegals stay back in the US and make deep cuts in the military budgets.  Support our Hardworking Law-abiding Immigrant community  Law-abiding immigrants who are skilled and contribute greatly to society wait forever to get the Green Cards. Wrong! o We need better balanced and sane immigration policies. Skilled labor visa priority must change to reduce tens of years of wait time.  Secure our borders and install high tech solutions for visa overstays. o Ro Khanna wants OPEN Borders (Co-sponsor of HR 5383) and supports allowing criminal illegals to remain in our country. Totally Wrong!  Reduce healthcare costs streamline regulations and have healthy competition  Allow the same company drug imports with minimal FDA issues  Price transparency from Medicare Hospitals and Insurance companies to facilitate competition in costs as well as premiums. Encourage upfront cost quotes before procedures are done.  Incentivize smaller clinics for primary care preventive medicine and usage of tax-free HSAs.  Re-examine drug price increases due to intermediaries and regulations.  Reduce the length of college requirements to enter medical school education. Two years of college is sufficient. Increase the supply of medical care personnel  Encourage more insurance plan options outside of the employer-based options.  Reduce hospital and doctors overhead by reforming onerous regulations. Medicare for All promoted by Ro Khanna is COSTLY and Reduces Quality. His argument that it can be paid by the operational savings (estimates of $40-60B per year) fall way short of the required expense of $2-3 Trillion per year. Tax increases for the higher and middle class would become inevitable.  Build Bay area infrastructure and regional cooperation for better traffic flows  To improve our quality of life we need a highly connected and well-coordinated public transit network of Trains BART Buses and Highways for the greater Bay area.  The above must be complemented with high tech innovations to increase the utilization of public transportation resources.  Local cities must be encouraged to create general plans for cities of the next generation i.e. smart cities that will provide work live educate and play environment hubs. These hubs will have shorter commutes and are generally self-sustaining in energy footprint.  Solve Climate Change through High-tech Innovations  Create a Congressional Scientific and Industrial Council (CSIC) focused on promoting Industrial breakthroughs for more efficient and safe energy generation from Solar Nuclear and other climate-friendly sources without impacting the economic well-being of people.  Promote energy conservation generally. Encourage innovative solutions in energy management for all consumption segments.  Pressure all industrialized nations to use better fuels and co-operate in research for cleaner energy solutions.",political,Facebook

Cole Gabriel  Write In Candidate for the Solon City Council    My wife and I moved here back in 2015 because we wanted our children to grow up in a place that had top notch schools a strong sense of community and a family friendly environment. Solon turned out to be that and so much more.    Moving to Solon was a culture shock in the best possible way. We weren't used to knowing our neighbors warm random chats from our fellow Solon Residents our kids being greeted by name in stores or the excitement for our school sports teams that can be heard across town. It quickly became the norm and we've grown to love it.    Im an adoring husband to my wonderful wife Paige who continues to be my rock and best friend. Devoted father to two wonderful and vibrant children; Anika who is 10 years old in the 5th grade and Leland who is 3 years old in his first year of preschool. One of my biggest drives is to make sure that they get to enjoy and love the wonderful community we live in I strive to show them what makes Solon so special as it continues to grow and prosper while maintaining a strong sense of community.    Ive worked at the University of Iowa as an accountant for the past five years and have proudly served as a member of the Iowa Air National Guard for the past 13 years serving as aircraft mechanic personnel/admin and most recently within the Equal Opportunity Office. Before that I worked at Systems Unlimited in numerous roles helping residents succeed in a home/community and assisting them with their finances as an accountant/representative payee. This rolls into my deep passion for education and service.    My education consists of a bachelors in psychology from Iowa State University a bachelors in accounting from the University of Iowa two year degrees in Aircraft Maintenance and Human Resources from the Community College of the Air Force and most recently I graduated from the Senior Non-Commissioned Officer Academy of the Air Force.    I believe this education and experience provides me with a solid foundation to serve the people of Solon.      If you do me the honor of writing me in as you next Solon City Council member I pledge to give you what Solon has already given me:      COMMUNITY: I pledge to work to treat the strong sense of community that binds Solon as a priority to promote and protect so it can continue to prosper.    COMPASSION: I pledge to hear the issues and concerns of Solons residents with recognition and respect so that everyone feels that they have been heard respected and listened to.    COMMITMENT: I pledge to give my all for the residents of Solon. All the education and experience I have up to today but also a promise to continue to learn and grow to better serve the city and its citizens.,political,Facebook
ENERGY and CLIMATE CHANGEI was recently asked about my view on industrial solar and how we combat climate change/global warming. This is a topic very important to me and I am passionate about. Basically I agree that humans have a negative impact on Earth and we need to reduce our personal carbon footprint on the environment. Negative human impacts include; pollution to waterways/habitat/soils carbon emissions overuse of water and disruption of natural water resources overconsumption of products garbage and lack of adequate recycling facilities etc. Our focus should be on reducing individual energy and natural resource needs at the local level and our homes. I disagree with filling 1000s of acres of high quality farm land with industrial solar period. Agriculture is our #1 economic income and we can not afford to destroy this land for future generations. In some countries farm land is deemed critical infrastructure and I believe the same should be done in Niagara County. Solar energy produced in our backyards will be transferred downstate with very little economic benefit to local municipalities and taxpayers. Billions of dollars of subsidies are being handed out to large corporations some foreign in order to meet unrealistic goals all funded by us taxpayers. I believe we need to return taxpayer money to the taxpayers by incentivizing reducing our energy needs AT THE SOURCE our homes/businesses/vehicles. We should increase tax breaks for home solar/wind systems in order to offset power consumption at the source which will save billions of dollars in upgrades to our already crumbling overworked power grid. Tax breaks and refunds for new windows furnaces roofs insulation etc. Give us back our money so that we can improve our homes and require less energy! We can not talk about increasing green energy production without first talking about reducing our individual energy/natural resource consumption. We need to make our homes more efficient and our vehicles carbon neutral. We all have the same goal To Protect Our Earth but a different path to get to the finish line. I believe my plan is the best path forward will increase jobs in a high paying market reduce our impact on Earth/Climate and enable future generations to continue moving in the right direction.

"WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE A CHRISTIAN TODAY?  We live in a very divided environment. Each day we see stories about abortion while at the same time seeing stories about people being tried in the courts for abusing an animal. We see stories about sky rocketing incidents or murder with guns. The guns are generally vilified while the people using the guns are given a pass. We see stories about tax free status for Christians being denied because Christians are generally Republicans. We see stories about all members of the white race being condemned as racists while on the other hand black lives matter. We see stories portraying our nation the United States of America as an outgrowth of slavery rather than as a continuing search for liberty and freedom. Our nation is described as a flawed and terrible place rather than an imperfect ideal searching for greater and greater perfection. Christians are under greater siege now than at any time in the past 100 years.  As these things continue to occur I feel that those who follow Jesus Christ thus who believe that he is the Son of God and the gate on the path to eternal life are being treated as members of a cult where each member believes in an invisible fantasy in a comic book story in a fictional concoction with no real meaning. I also believe there are real reasons Christians are portrayed in this manner.  First many many churches contribute to this fantasy. With their beautiful buildings and symbols with their order and structure with their entertaining music and continuous social activities; with the Sunday School classes and fellowship meetings with the meals and the yard sales with the choruses and bands with the internal networking churches provide a structure that makes both members and guests feel wanted feel cared for feel like they are joining something important. Sometimes this is true. Sometimes it is a facade; a lie.  Christians believers in Jesus Christ are not club members who can be a little bit in or half-way in. Christians are all the way in. They believe in Jesus Christ. They develop their lives around faith in Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ dictates their actions and their thoughts. This is not to say believers are perfect or even nearly perfect. As hard as they try to live as Christ lived they fall short. All members of mankind are sinners; we all fall short. During these trying times it isn't just individual Christians who fall short: it is the Church as an institution that is falling short.  In the United States of America two parts; the establishment clause and the free exercise clause of the First Amendment of the Constitution guarantee that the government will not and can not interfere with the free exercise of religion. However over the past eighteen months churches in mass have kowtowed to the government shuttered their doors locked out their congregations and failed to carry out even the most oft quoted command of our God ""Fear Not."" They have willingly given up their freedom under the Constitution and failed to obey God. This surrender of autonomy this abdication of authority has totally undermined the importance of organized religion in our country. Instead of acting independently to go forward in their collective trust in the sanctity and authority of Jesus Christ they have surrendered to fear. Instead of moving forward with their activities while at the same time presenting alternatives to those who did fear the churches closed their doors and became social media platforms; just another source of information. Organized churches stripped off the armor of God and bared themselves to the assaults of heathens.  At the same time they were giving away their power and authority the churches failed to take firm stands against sins clearly enunciated in the Bible. They failed to take a stand within the constraints of the Word of God. Thousands of churches condone and accept abortion of children. Thousands of additional churches accept the leadership of those bragging about and consistently seeking deviant life styles; lives as homosexuals or lesbians; lives as bisexuals; lives during which they surgically change the characteristics of their biological gender or lifestyles during which they claim to be of a different gender or of no gender. They celebrate their ""pride"" in their deviance. Though the church is entrusted to accept these behaviors; after all they are simply different sins from stealing lying cheating worshipping idols etc.; the church should always accept these behaviors with the grace and tolerance of knowing that those who believe will seek to minimize to eliminate the frequency of their sinning; that they will strive to achieve a more sin free life. Many many churches are failing to accomplish even that. Additional churches are accepting of these behaviors to the point of putting those who practice this behavior into leadership positions. Satan leading the flock. How appropriate in this evil society in which we live.  Of even greater import to those who attend traditional churches should be the lack of outreach the failure to carry out the instructions of Jesus Christ to love our neighbors to treat our neighbors as ourselves to help others. Many churches have little or not outreach few or no ministries designed to help those around them. Tens of thousands of churches do little more than maintain the building in which they meet and pay those tasked with instructing them in the ways of Jesus Christ. If it were not so sad it would be almost humorous that three average guys have met every week face to face in the homes of one another each Sunday fixed a breakfast each week engaged in fellowship conducted a sermon or class every seven days periodically offered Communion developed a website and a local presence and conduct many many ministries within our community. Not only do we build the occasional ramp for the handicapped provide food boxes to elderly Jews support Angel Tree programs for many children assist with the care of the homeless send the children of incarcerated men and women to summer camps but are also active in assisting other ministries to obtain and build busses for use during emergencies support Kairos to visit and minister to those incarcerated participate in the multi-denominational men's group in Northeaster North Carolina but also support Emmaus to provide more intensive support to practicing Christians. To be blunt we are not scared have not been scared and have blatantly disobeyed the governments attempts to control us. Furthermore as a group we have been chastised by other Christians for our beliefs and our actions.  Jesus Christ did not have an easy life. Being a man is not easy. Following Jesus Christ is not easy and it was never intended to be so. If you are going to proclaim yourself to be a Christian it is time to open your hearts attempt to discern what God is telling you to do put on your big-boy pants and start doing your jobs. Though Jesus Christ never coined ""The Great Commission"" he did tell us to make disciples of all nations and to baptize them. Go out and do it. Do not allow others to tell you that you are wrong and can not do it. GO OUT AND DO! Being a Christian is being in action.",political,Facebook

RAISING OUR KIDS IT DOES NOT TAKE A VILLAGE  Rabbi Yakov Saacks The Chai Center Dix Hills NY Author of The Kabbalah of Life  According to Wikipedia the well-known saying It takes a village is an African proverb that means that an entire community of people must interact with children for those children to experience and grow in a safe and healthy environment. The phrase has been used as book titles for a number of well-known books. I recently purchased a book penned by the former first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton with this title. The book is basically conveying that the responsibility of raising a child falls upon the community.  I asked myself what is Judaisms take on this topic.  Of course I could never argue the point that a child has many influences in his or her life aside from parents and other family members because we all do and a child is no different. There are teachers coaches tutors peers and mentors actors doctors as well as social media personalities. The list of influences can literally be endless. Additionally it is vital that a child/human have interactions and learn from everyone.  However what I will contend is that parents have to do everything in their power so that they raise inculcate and instill morals and values into their kids and not allow others to take their place. Parents should be the sole (main) guide/arbitrator in their childs formative years and not someone like Miley Cyrus.  SCHOOL Lets take school for example. Not only should parents be involved to ensure that their child is getting a solid education parents need to be vigilant to the best of their ability that the education imparted is not antithetical to their values. Take the school in Randolph New Jersey where the Board of Ed removed all references to religious and cultural holidays and referred to them as simply a day off. Yom Kippur is not simply a day off; it is Yom Kippur and likewise Veterans day. A very vocal parent body went crazy and rightly so. The decision was quickly reversed and the holiday naming calendar was restored.  I also think that parents should gather and stop teachers from spewing their opinion on whom to vote for in an election. A teacher needs to teach and if a student knows whom the teacher is voting for then the teacher is not teaching but rather influencing which is way beyond their job description. Remember a child in elementary or high school is very malleable and it should be up to the parents to shape their kids.  I applaud former Fox anchor Megyn Kelly who took decisive action by withdrawing her children from their school because she felt that her children were being indoctrinated negatively and inconsistent with her way.  COLLEGE College is so influential in a young adults life. College is where your child is free from your daily input and it is where your child will find his or her independence. It is therefore imperative that the student enter freshman year with a very clear understanding of right wrong moral immoral and a decent sense of their culture religion and creed. College can make a person doubt their entire upbringing so therefore the more involved and influential the parents are the stronger the resolve to stay true to oneself.  SYNAGOGUE Contrary to popular belief the synagogue/sanctuary is not the backbone of a Jewish communitys religious and spiritual life. In fact it is pretty low on the totem pole of priorities. As an example if there is limited money a Torah scroll school and a mikveh pool are to be purchased before a synagogue building.  The very best place to nurture a childs soul is in the home. In fact one cannot expect a child to have a spiritual spark if it is lacking in the home. There are so many people that I interact with who tell me they come to The Chai Center to pray because it helps them connect to their creator. I always share that the best place to do this is in the home.  Lets flesh this out. If a kid sees a Rabbi keeping kosher or praying he/she will not be that moved because it is expected that a Rabbi does these kinds of things. However when mom and dad keep kosher then it really hits home pardon the pun. Every child knows that I study Torah daily  big deal. How about when a kid sees his mom or dad with a Jewish book  now that is the real deal.  MORAL COMPASS A Rabbi teacher mentor or coach cannot be the moral compass for your family. It must come from the home. Simply put if parents have the school teach their children morals and values then they are shirking their responsibility. According to the Torah in the paragraph of the Shma (our creed) it clearly states You shall teach to your children. It does not say have others teach. The fact that we even have Jewish schools was because the Rabbis felt it was a necessity to combat the growing ignorance and illiteracy. They never considered formal education as plan A.  DO YOUR JOB Therefore my parents and grandparents stand up proudly and valiantly and take back the responsibility in raising your kid. Do not leave it to the rest of the village. You have a rich history that only you can impart. These lessons coming from someone else will not have the same impact. It would be akin to me teaching basketball which does not appeal to me at all.  I do not want anyone at my childs school telling my child what his or her sexuality can or should be. I need the school to teach the dreaded math social studies English literature and how to blow a trumpet.  Please feel free to share.,political,Facebook
"According to https://kernpublichealth.com/covid-19_dashboard/ we have had 49939 case of COVID in Kern County Residents as of 12/12/2020 out of which 19186 residents have recovered and 467 residents passed away. what happened to the other 30386? Obviously some of them recovered and were never documented and some are still present in the population. How many? we don't know. So what are our chances of getting COVID and/or a serious complication after getting an infection? Fortunately a team of Statisticians at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine have devised a tool to answer it based on ""genetic demographic anthropometric life-style and environmental factors"". Based on this tool # I have 2.2 times the risk of dying from COVID or twice the average risk. However what about my Profession as a Physician my Physical and Mental Health status Status of my Immunity and Behavioral practices? Is there any way we can document all that? I don't think so. We can do whatever we want but what actually ends up happening is because of an infinite number of interactions between Our Genetics the Genetics of the Micro-organisms that Infect us or Reside within us Our Environment and Our Behaviors that affect our Genes too. Actually Schroeder et al in a study published in NEJM showed that our Behavior and Environment are the major determinants of health in 60% of cases. Yet we waste billions of dollars in research and all these tools which don't have any place in real life except in Journals and only serve to promote or secure the Positions of the Researchers in their Institutes. No wonder they are accompanied by such Disclaimers ""It is important to note that an individual's risk will also heavily depend on personal behavior such as social distancing hand washing and mask-wearing. It is also crucial to remember that individuals who themselves have a low risk of COVID-19 serious illness and/or mortality they are still able to spread the infection to others who are at high-risk. The tool is not intended to be used for any medical or treatment decisions."" So what is the purpose of the tool? I guess it is only for entertainment and so is most of the research. I am reminded about a quote from my Statistics Professor at University of Washington who started the course with a disclaimer ""Irrespective of what I teach you always remember Statistics is nothing but Lies and Lies and Lies"" and yet we allow all the Politicians Scientists and the Computer Professionals to spread these lies and control our lives. I am certainly not saying that COVID doesn't exist. Yes it does and has surpassed Cardiovascular Diseases as the most common cause of DEATH and we need to get the VACCINE out to the masses as soon as possible until we can find a cure but let's not waste time money and efforts on anything but the basic science EVERYTHING ELSE is COMMON SENSE.

4 Day School and Work Week The pandemic may be an opportunity to address social distancing and risk group concerns by implementing a more flexible school and working environment. During the terms of the Bush and Obama presidencies the nation had to work through an economic down turn. The causes (save for another time) that most of us can point to were factors beyond the direct control of the general public. Yet we had to hold on to our jobs maintain our institutions and meet the needs of our families. The response to this pandemic has placed those burdens and new challenges upon us once again. I'd like to suggest an idea that may well be a social benefit - the 4-Day School and Work Week. It's been talked about for decades and during the Obama presidency some parts of society put into practice. The benefits helped mitigate rising energy costs the time and cost of commuting provided workers the time needed to conduct personal/family affairs reduce the operating cost on schools (largely private) and ease the cost burden of childcare. Dont misunderstand me working for a living and having a career is the means by which this capitalist system functions. But the 4 day school and work week can have the same productivity of full time hours (36-40 work week). It does not limit instruction or access to public and private services and can ease the demand on adults and parents out of the home working as their number one priority five days a week. - Businesses and government offices can still be open five days a week by staggering the work force Monday thru Thursday and Tuesday thru Friday. - Workers gain a day during the normal week to do person business errands and mentoring children without having to find time around their work schedule. * Employers who offer (or cant offer) PTO - personal time off credits benefit by increased job satisfaction and not losing productive workers during the work day needing to attend to errands family needs doctors appointment etc. - Schools can revolutionize a new concept for delivering instruction and give students more free time at the end of the school week to master concepts and do assignments. * Due to the pandemic cleaning of our facilities is taking on an added level of diligence. When the bulk of students are not in our schools on Fridays that creates a deep clean day each week (in addition to daily cleaning) spent performing intensive cleaning with 3 days of idle time for residual virus presence on surfaces to degrade. * A modest increase in the school hours each day will still meet education mandates. Working parents would find this helpful to know they may not need to cut their workday short to be with children when their school day end in the early afternoon.  Some private schools have been doing 4-Day school weeks for almost a decade now. Some observed and brainstormed benefits of a Monday thru Thursday school day: - School district savings in terms of operating costs. Programs like School Breakfast and Lunch could still be in place for all five days. - Teachers gain a day for preparation grading and online specialized instruction each week. - The day the building is idle could provide limited additional instruction library or internet access in rural area. - This could also create a mechanism for over-time pay for time spent on Fridays when performing these tasks now largely done on their after school times. - Elementary students through age 12 would be a one day a week daycare concern for parents that could be managed it they too had a 4-Day work week. - Fridays could be a special instruction or School sponsored Childcare option for elementary students too young to be home alone. - Junior High and High School extracurricular activities remain largely unaffected with practices sports and special events scheduling can still make use of Friday afternoons and evenings. A shift to a 4-Day School structure does not have to mean a less content or quality of educational instruction. Likewiseworkers and employers in the private sector benefit from staggering workers' days on site with a modest daily increase in hours to meet full-time employment standards. By staggering work schedules (M-TH / T -F) does not mean businesses need to be closed an additional day each week. Service industries may even see an increase in business with workers able to better manage time to take care of personal business outside of their normal work hours making more time for leisure to enjoy the fruits of our labor.,political,Facebook

COVID AND CLIMATE CHANGE There is increasing evidence that rising global temperatures both increases the rate of adaptation of viruses that pose a risk to human health and also increases the rate at which viruses migrate from the wild into human civilization. If we do not address climate change head on then we may be increasingly battling more and more viruses that are harmful to human beings. The Covid-19 pandemic may be merely a harbinger of future pandemic crises being more commonplace in our lifestyle. If we do not address climate change viruses will adapt and infect and kill. Subsequently we will have to adapt to be a less physically social civilization. Climate change is the most pertinent environmental concern in the wake of Covid-19. To avoid pandemics as a permanent way of life we must take climate change seriously and do our part here in Maine to protect our environment and our way of life.,political,Facebook

Bellville Times 10/28. *Early Voting Ends Friday*  I believe public education is a fundamental aspect of American life if not the most fundamental. It is the one true protector of the core belief that led to the foundation of this country. The belief that the success of an individual should be dictated by what they are able to achieve with their talents and hard work not by that status they were born into. A strong public education system is fundamental to fulfilling the promise of American meritocracy. The public school system provides everyone the opportunity to pursue and develop their talents whether they lie in academics arts athletics or in trade work and determine their best path for success independent from the interests desires or priorities of their parents. Without this an individual elevating themselves above what they were born to would be extremely rare. However the occurrence of an individual falling below where they started would be much more common. I also believe that the quality of a communitys public education system dictates the fate of that community. Communities that invest heavily in the quality of their school systems see a number of benefits. Children that leave these systems have better outcomes in life. These same children choose to return to raise their children in a supportive environment and seek to give back to the community that gave to them. Families searching for a place to live choose to live in communities with good schools. These communities thrive. Those that do not fall into a spiral of decline. El Campo LaMarque and Navasota were all once larger districts than Bellville. The population within Bellville ISD has approximately doubled since I graduated in 1997; yet these locations have stagnated or declined. A primary factor in this difference in trajectory is the quality of our school system. To fight against public education is to fight against meritocracy. More importantly it is to fight against your community. It has been extremely disheartening to see several members of this community that are willing to openly engage in a disinformation campaign against their own community. The interests of one are seem obvious. She is using this fight against her community to attempt to elevate her status enough to wage yet another failed cam- paign for public office. The other primary actor is someone that has made it his lifes work to be against good ideas. These individuals have not been honest in their communication. They are not leaders. Rather their complete lack of knowledge or understanding of the issues facing Bellville ISD reveals that they are fringe members of this community. While I completely disagree with their position there are a few things that are important to recognize. These individuals are unwittingly serving the interests of politicians in Austin that are working tirelessly to change the way we administer public education in Texas. In recent years the State of Texas has taken complete control over the operating budgets of school districts by nearly eliminating the ability for a district to raise more local revenues for operations. The state has repeatedly reduced the percentage of local revenues and supple- mented them with more state revenues. In the last legislative session several bills were proposed that are designed to completely eliminate local funding over time. The end goal of these politicians is to move Texas to a voucher system for schools. This system would give each student a certain amount of tax dollars that could be taken anywhere whether that be a public school and private school or for home schooling. Moving to this system would have the effect of immediately removing about 16% of total public school funding from circulation (Currently 10% of Texas children are home schooled; another 6% go to private schools). I do not support the move to a voucher system; however I think the politicians that do are going to win this fight. I am of the opinion that a move to this system is likely within the next ten years. I think that it is likely that a decent percentage of our community would be in support of a move to a voucher system those leading the opposition included. If you support such a move you should understand that under that system communities that have high performing districts will get stronger; those that do not will decline rapidly. Now is the time to invest in ourselves to guarantee the success of this community in the near term and far term regardless of the environment we find ourselves working under. Most of the districts around us invest twice what we do in providing for their schools in the form of facilities. The longer we wait the further behind we will fall which hinders Bellvilles ability to remain an exceptional place to learn and live. Though so many voice a resistance to growth I think more should be concerned with getting to a point of decline if we do not continue to ad- vance what we have to offer to both sustain and thrive in the coming years.

I am honored to announce that I am once again running for a spot on the EHT School Board. I am a leader a father and resident of Egg Harbor Township. I believe that public education is intimately tied to the liveliness of our community. Investing in our children now means a better future for Egg Harbor Township. In order to provide every child with the education they deserve the Egg Harbor Township School Board must be transparent and accountable to the public. Every decision made by the School Board has lasting effects on the entire township. The School Board must do their job to provide quality education at an affordable cost to our taxpayers. My focus areas are student achievement expanding the Early College Program community communication school funding and taxes. I will offer something unique to the school board. I feel that being in the military for over 12 years has given me qualities that could greatly benefit our district. My military career has taught me the importance of Integrity Ambition Dependability Professionalism TEAMWORK Adaptability Organization and the ability to understand and give direction. I will use this experience to help foster an environment of honesty and efficiency for our district.

"Our current school board is reviewing a plan to send students and staff back to buildings with no reduction in class size. All while streaming the meeting and not opening the room to the public. The excuse of ""we are mandated to not gather in groups larger than 50"" does not hold up. Then allow the room to fill to the maximum capacity. An average secondary classroom will easily reach half this threshold in an environment one sixth the size.

THE BAR/BAT MITZVAH MISTAKE FORGET OMAR  FOCUS ON SELF  Rabbi Yakov Saacks The Chai Center Dix Hills NY  I do not want to write about anti-Semitism this week because quite frankly Ilhan Omar the quintessential anti-Semite won her primary which is mind boggling as she is clearly from the dark side of the force. How her district voted for her again when her agenda was solely focused on denigrating other people says a lot about the voters. I therefore will look inwardly and focus my thoughts on my Jewish brethren and sisters.  For those who know me personally and have heard me lecture previously what I am about to write is nothing new. I feel though that I cannot say or write it enough. The topic is entitled The Bar/Bat Mitzvah Mistake.  I have been wracking my brain to answer the following questions. Why is it that many of our Bar/Bat Mitzvah parents are so nervous about the big day that they will book the party years in advance and painfully get into heavy debt making these few hours so special for their children that they can barely put gas into their car to get to the event? Why do we rarely see these kids back in shul/temple post Bar/Bat Mitzvah? Most importantly what can be done to assure that the Bar/Bat Mitzvah stays focused on Judaism and involved in the Jewish way of life once the great event has transpired and beyond? How can we best structure the Bar/Bat Mitzvah environment so that it will have a positive Jewish impact and effect for many years to come especially through those turbulent college years?  After giving the above much thought I realized that one answer would satisfy all of the above questions. The solution lies with the parents and not with the shul/temple. The respective Jewish organizations must take an active role in guiding the parents. The following are my humble suggestions.  BRING YOUR CHILD TO SERVICES WITH YOU Take your child to services and stay with him or her for the duration of the service. Do not just drop them off and wave goodbye and then go play tennis. Show your children that participation is very important to you and to your family and not just a means to an end. By clearing your Shabbat schedule or a part thereof of everything else other than Jewish stuff will make you the parent a living example that in your life G-d & Judaism are important and They come first. This holds just as true post Bar/Bat Mitzvah as well. Actions do speak louder than words.  SHOW POSITIVE JEWISH CHANGES In honor of this most beautiful occasion of the Bar/Bat Mitzvah you as the parents should encourage your entire family to take upon themselves an extra Mitzvah -- good deed. Permit me to give you some examples. Mother and daughters should begin lighting the Shabbat candles and bring a spiritual warmth and light into the home on Friday nights. Dads should begin exploring the idea of putting on tefillin again one or two days a week. Even if you have not put on tefillin since your Bar Mitzvah it is something you should do as this will allow you to bond together in a very unique way.  TEFILLIN It is my strong view that a Bar Mitzvah boy must own his very own pair of tefillin not one on loan from his grandfather. Having ones own tefillin is something that the child will enjoy for a long time. It was bought for him and not just a hand-me-down. If your child puts on tefillin even occasionally it is a very powerful tie to Judaism.  FRIDAY NIGHTS Keep Friday nights sacrosanct. Make sure that on every Friday evening the family gathers around the table and that kiddush is recited and then is followed by a holy Shabbat meal complete with good food good wine singing and plenty of laughter. If your kids wish to go somewhere Friday night they should know that sitting with the family when they are home is non-negotiable.  $$$$$$$$$$$$$ Lastly do not spend exorbitant sums of money on a party. The attraction should not be the DJ or the caterer but rather the Soul of the Bar/Bat Mitzvah. There are plenty of charities that could use the money. The New York Friendship Circle as an example is a wonderful charity that I am involved with that helps children with special needs socialize and have friends and peers (). Why waste it on the D.J. and twerkers?  Teach your child that in his/her honor donations were made and that children were helped. In the end this is way more valuable than a cocktail hour.

Tonight I took the opportunity to speak at the school board meeting during public participation. I wanted to share those thoughts here as well. If you ever have any questions on where I stand on a particular issue please reach out.  ***  Good Evening my name is Sarah Florimonte and I am here tonight to address some comments made at previous board meetings about how we are addressing issues of diversity equity inclusion and racism in our district culture and curriculum.  There is a lot of factually inaccurate information spreading through our community and the country at large when it comes to the intentions of educators to teach about race and specifically institutional racism. The term Critical Race Theory or CRT has been turned into a catch-all phrase for any teachings around race. This allows people to take any tiny piece of diversity education and tie it to the teachings of CRT which is an academic concept only taught in 5% of colleges in high-level courses. Literally nobody in our district is teaching CRT and spreading the idea that CRT will be taught in the future is meant to put a stop to any discussion around race. Missing from these discussions are any examples from our district of CRT being taught or included in any future curriculum just extreme isolated examples from around the country. Making our teachers and administrators waste time fighting about CRT is keeping them from continuing the real work that needs to be done in our district and it has to stop. Teaching students about equity diversity and institutional racism is not Critical Race Theory.  I grew up in a far less diverse community than Hilliard and when I graduated high school in 2005 I went to the University of Dayton a Catholic College. That year all incoming freshmen were required to read a book called Urban Injustice: How Ghettos Happened by David Hilfiker. I was absolutely out of my element reading a book about social justice and how American institutions created and maintained urban poverty. That short 158 page book began to turn my entire worldview upside down but in truth I also felt duped by my lack of education around race and institutional racism in our country. I was in the dark for so long knowing next to nothing about the history of racism. As I sat in seminar that fall at school many of my classmates spent hours arguing against the tenants in the book and the facts within. I quickly realized that instead of embracing new ideas and inarguable truths presented to them these students clung to the inaccuracies they had been taught either on purpose or by omission at school or at home. It wasnt that any of them were taught to be racist or even that they were racist its that none of us had been presented with the idea that racism lives within our institutions and the truth is we will never solve the issues of race in this country without first acknowledging how we got to where we are.  Age eighteen is far too late for this education to start. It seems important for me to note here that learning about institutional racism didnt make me feel bad about being white as some people claim it simply made me more empathetic and gave me a hunger for more education around these issues. Teaching about institutional racism is also not Anti-American. In fact omitting large portions of history and lessons learned from past and current institutional mistakes is a disservice to our students who are the future leaders in our cities and country. I only wish that I had the opportunity to learn equity and diversity in a fair and open environment by talented educators like the ones we have in Hilliard at a much earlier age . This is why I fully support The Office of Equity and Diversity as they continue their work. Thank you.  ***,political,Facebook
"I'm so happy to report at our last budget workshop we were able to collectively bring many projects to the City of Dania Beach! On top of approving projects that will address our landscaping citywide lighting paving speed humps infrastructure and so much more my colleagues also brought projects that will directly impact our environment job training housing assistance and land acquisition.  As you know the County allocated $25m in federal CARES funding for a program that will help residents pay portions of unpaid rent. All Dania Beach residents were able to apply for this grant.  In addition to those funds the CRA board allocated an additional $250k to help residents in the most vulnerable part of our City. Remember our CRA was created to eliminate slum and blight in our City and CRA funds can only be spent in the CRA area.  We have also agreed to bring forth a $100k artificial reef project as well as a $75k program that will help pay for expenses related to job training in the marine industry.  We also will be addressing speeding concerns around the City with a traffic speeding assessment.  Lastly we discussed the desire to ""buy the block"" in the CRA to bring forth a creative project for housing!  I stand behind all of these projects!  I hope you stay tuned to the wonderful things we are doing in our City!  - Commissioner James",political,Facebook
This week I was able to meet with the Newton City Manager City Engineer and the City Finance Director. I asked them many questions about our municipal utility rates that were of interest to me.  I would like to begin by pointing out that most people call their municipal utility bill their water bill. When people complain they complain about their water rates being too high but I'll be addressing more than just the cost of water itself. As I continue my research I will be addressing the City utility rates as a whole - giving a breakdown of all segments of a local municipal utility bill which include water sewer trash/recycling and the plant upgrade fee. These are all listed separate on your Newton City utility bill each month.  This initial visit to Newton City Hall was a very good experience. All three of the City Staff I met with were quite helpful in providing the information I requested. I was interested in understanding the various elements that drive the cost of City provided utilities and found there was often a lot to unpack when dealing with these cost factors - such as E.P.A. regulations both providing water to citizens as well as dispelling this water after usage back into the environment general maintenance upkeep of facilities water rights maintenance of wells and the list goes on.  I've always believed accountability and transparency in government is vital if you want any chance of creating trust between the government and the people. I really was impressed with the openness of City Staff and walked away feeling as though I was allowed to ask all of my questions and gather the data I thought was relevant. I am going to make my best effort as I move forward with this WSU self-study class to continue gathering as much data as possible so I can give my inside view of City utility issues and do my best to give a breakdown of this data and to answer any questions you might have. I have already received several calls about this mini-investigation since my last post and appreciate your input and will attempt provide you with answers to your questions as I proceed.  My take away from this first meeting was that City staff was very open and transparent. They have already provided me with lots of good information that's already in the public domain for anyone to see and I will be allowed access to verify any of information I was given. At this point I would encourage anyone who has any questions regarding their utility bill contact the City about any concern they might have.  More to come...,political,Facebook
The community dream of a Ponto Coastal Park needs to be a reality.  Carlsbad families need this park. We know parks are good for our environment and addressing the adverse effects of climate change. Parks also lead to better air quality and numerous health benefits. They reduce crime encourage family friendly recreation and provide critical outdoor space. We need to protect preserve and support open spaces and parks.  For years it has been clear there is a 30-acre park deficit in Carlsbad and specifically a 6.6-acre park deficit in the coastal Southwest quadrant of Carlsbad where Ponto is located.  Rather than tackling the heart of the matter head on Carlsbad politicians have side-stepped the issue inviting out-of-town developers to consider building dense luxury homes on this land and ignoring the fact that this land was intended to be non-residential reserve land. Campaign contributions from developers have outweighed what is best for our neighborhoods and families. That is unacceptable.  It is a disservice to the families of South Carlsbad-- not to mention a planning mistake-- for the city to count a portion of Veterans Park in the Northwest area of the city as satisfying our local park deficit. Parks should be within the communities they serve so families can walk or bike to them without having to drive.  Time and again Carlsbad residents have asserted that we value our small town feel beach community character and connectedness  all of which would be supported by a community park at Ponto.  This vacant land is up for sale and there is debate about whether it can be developed into a dense housing development of mostly unaffordable luxury homes.  Rather than give more of our precious coastline away we need to preserve this unique land. Let us protect our beautiful Carlsbad coast from overdevelopment fight climate change and provide services for our families. Join me in supporting a Ponto Coastal Park.  #carlsbad #pontopark #peopleforponto #developpontoright #teresaforcarlsbad,political,Facebook

Sue Mullens Voting Record Doesnt Represent Me  The general election is just a few weeks away and I dont think weve ever had a more important one for our country and our state. Once upon a time we in New Hampshire could count on our legislators to at least listen to us and work on solutions for the common good but that was then. Today ideology is king and its important to know where a candidate stands because that is how he/she will surely vote.  For me the education and care of our children is a top priority. I want our next generation to have every opportunity for a quality education in a safe and supportive environment with educators who recognize the rights of caring parents to raise their children as they see fit.  Thats why I cant vote for Sue Mullen as my representative this year. Dont get me wrong. I like and respect her and am thankful for the time and service shes given to our schools and children. But when it comes to deciding state policy her voting record doesnt match up with my convictions not even a little.  The good news is that when you consider an incumbent their votes will tell the story if you just dig a little. (Heres a link to the House voting record.) When it comes to education heres what I found on Sue:   Sue was against allowing public schools to pursue innovation in education. (HB 569)  Sue voted against the rights of families to have legal recourse against schools who acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in cases of bullying or cyberbullying. (HB 1335)  Sue voted to add sex and gender identity to the list of non-discrimination categories for schools effectively rendering schools unable to make distinctions of facilities or sports participation based on sex. (SB 263)  Sue opposed preserving womens sports for biological women (HB1251).  Sue opposed a bill that would have protected the religious liberty of students and teachers. (HB 1334)  Sue voted to change the parental permission requirements for often personally invasive non-academic surveys to require parents to opt out rather than opt in. (HB 1459 SB 196)  Based on her voting record I know for certain Sue and I will never agree on how we should run our schools and state. While I can appreciate her as a neighbor and someone whos worked in our school system I cant trust her to represent my interests in Concord.,political,Facebook

"Virginia Beach City Council has an important meeting July 28th at 6pm. As I'm running for a council seat the Rose Hall seat I want you to know how CONRAD stands on the big ticket items.  There's a resolution to Oppose Offshore Drilling & Seismic Testing off Virginia Beach's coast. Because the world should jointly move off of greenhouse gas emitting fossil fuels and the collection of said fuel is itself dangerous to the local environment and because seismic testing is done to help find oil/natural gas with its own hazardous effects on marine life - I would vote to support that resolution.  There's also a resolution requesting the Circuit Court order a referendum on November's General Election ballot. A Presidential election year has the greatest possible turnout expanding the VB voting base for a greater sample size of VB opinion - we did this with Light Rail so timing is not an issue. This referendum puts an ordinance on the books requesting a City Charter change to Virginia Beach city council's election process. It wants to convert from an At Large system to a Directly Elected District System. The first bone I have to pick with our system is when I filed to run for Rose Hall I needed to live in Rose Hall. If I actually didn't live in Rose Hall it would be criminal to run for it. However I still have to stress to the whole city all VB Citizens can vote for me even if YOU do not live in the district. That's a mismatch. There's greater issues than that nuisance representation being the chief issue. If a concerned citizen living in Rose Hall appeals to the city for a hard effort to fix flooding they would also be inclined to vote for a person sharing the interest. And in Virginia Beach - - Princess Anne Kempsville Bayside Lynnhaven Centerville and Beach District Voters also supply a vote toward or against that Rose Hall person. This dilutes the Rose Hall resident's vote within the other districts. It's not unlike ""Shareholder Dilution"" a concern of folks who hold minority stakes in large companies. That's when a company suddenly issues large amounts of new shares into the market reducing the power of folks who are already minority shareholders in the business. This would especially be concerning for the underlying racial minority population of the city which has historically been under represented on Council compared to the relative population. It has played out in history such as Burton Station's water and sewer lines. Founded by freed slaves Burton Station is a community in the NW section of the Bayside district. It was the last section of the city north of the Green Line to get water and sewer lines and it wasn't like it was 1914. It was 2014. Many people over the decades abandoned the area due to a lack of fundamental services and that is an area with a higher minority population than in other parts of Virginia Beach. It took too long to do the project even the Bayside Councilman admits that and that district has a history of having a majority of its citizens vote for a candidate that the rest of the city combined to outnumber that choice. That's why the phrase ""systemic racism"" exists. Not to point a specific blame on a specific person or even necessarily a set of people - but a behavior of the system itself. The system behaves in a way that reduces the power of minorities in our population it is systemically an issue that can be corrected by a system overhaul. This vote is the first step of that overhaul. I would vote Yes on the direct district election system referednum.  I have a deep appreciation for Virginia Beach so much so that I'd like to help improve it. I can help improve the city through a council person's seat and I do not need tens of thousands of dollars from high powered developer interests to become one. I just ask for your vote on November 3rd.  - Conrad Schesventer",political,Facebook
Friends  Im pleased to launch my Facebook page in my campaign to be your next mayor of Santa Barbara.  My concern for the city's lack of clear mayoral leadership is what led my decision to enter the race. We need practical non-partisan and common-sense leadership to face our city's current challenges.  Currently Staff and uniformed public safety are not being supported by the Mayor in these critical times and we're facing a period with an interim Police Chief and City Administrator two of the most critical factors in the continuity of the city's organization.  I spent 37 years as a business owner and employer with a bird's eye view of City Hall and have worked with every Mayor and City Administrator during that period. I served on our City Council for the last 9 of those 37 years.  It's time we elect someone with experience and no political future. Let's bring Santa Barbara back to a clean safe and healthy environment and economy.  I would be honored by your support!,political,Facebook
In a focus group conducted in December 2006 by the National Council of Disabilities (NCD) about the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) one human resources executive described the relationship between the ADA and employers as like the conflict between labor unions and management. The HR focus group participants generally felt extremely fearful of discrimination lawsuits under the ADA. They said that the resulting effect this fear had on employers is an unwillingness to hire qualified individuals with disabilities. Many of the participants stated that employers are concerned about these types of lawsuits even in the cases in which they are doing everything to the letter and in the spirit of the law. (Pgs. 260-261 of the October 2007 NCD report titled Empowerment for Americans with Disabilities: Breaking Barriers to Careers and Full Employment.)  Based on my experience that fear began to infiltrate the hiring practices of most companies around the mid-1990s. I sat through more than just a few interviews that felt like I was watching a broken football play. It certainly was a shock to think that I may no longer be able to obtain a full-time permanent job. It was unsettling because those feelings were in opposition to the positive way in which I grew up and the proactive way I pursued my education and progressed through the first twenty-five years of my professional career.  To understand the phenomenon from my point of view you need to know that my lifeline began with polio in my right leg when I was three years old. That was in 1949 before the Salk vaccine. I have used crutches to walk all my life. In the 1950s there were two or three kids in every other house in our neighborhood just south of Boston. I did everything there was to do - baseball football and eventually water skiing and snow skiing too. For family my friends and me my so-called handicap was always an absolute non-issue and I always maintained a very positive can do attitude.  I worked my way through undergraduate and graduate school earning a BSBA from Northeastern University in 1971 and an MBA from Babson College in 1981. Before during and after my college years I had a successful professional career in accounting finance and general management. Then starting in the mid-1990s it became all but impossible to find anything but contract work as opposed to regular full-time permanent employment. The negative legal ramifications of the ADA had become the focus of many Continuing Education Courses for financial and administrative executives particularly in the private sector business community.  Of course having walked on crutches all my life I am aware of the range of perceptions people have about disabled people. To some a disabled person is just another person. However I would estimate that just as many people possess deeply ingrained misconceptions and discriminatory attitudes toward disabled people. They just cannot relate in a normal manner to a disabled person. After the ADA of 1990 became law prohibiting employment discrimination based on disability (supposedly to open more job opportunities for disabled people) those attitudes worsened because of the legal dilemmas faced by executives contemplating the possibility of hiring a handicapped individual.  Experiential evidence proved to me that many companies trained their hiring managers to cleverly avoid and navigate their way around the ADA. Of course that puts the disabled population into a double-bind situation. If a disabled person even touches upon this notion for example to help explain his or her past employment difficulty that person automatically becomes a potential legal issue. Thus from the point of view of the business community in general disabled people became an issue an absolute legal issue.  By early 2009 my life was not in the best of financial condition because I only had been able to find occasional contract work. Even so I never gave up and I never stopped looking for full time work. In fact I cast a wide net while continuing my research and self-study. I worked hard to stay abreast of the latest developments in the areas of accounting finance and information systems.  Fortunately I have always been in good health and try to stay in good physical condition. Thus from my point of view I still had many years of work ahead of me to recover financially that is if only I could find a suitable job. That is why when I saw an advertisement for a Disabilities Job Fair that was going to be at the Copley Plaza Hotel in Boston in April 2009 I decided to be one of the first in line and showed up early. The job fair was the first of its kind that I had ever heard of and attended. Equal Opportunity Publications which publishes the CAREERS & the disABLED magazine sponsored the job fair.  Coincidentally Ron Glockner an ex-avionics engineer for the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) then retired but still recruiting for NAVAIR on a part-time basis also showed up early. Ron and I met that morning going up the escalator together at the Copley Plaza. Ron invited me to join him in the lobby for a cup of coffee. We spent almost an hour together. That gave us the opportunity to become acquainted before the job fair even began. That was a life-changing cup of coffee. Ultimately because I had the right qualifications Ron promoted my resume to several hiring managers at NAVAIR during the summer and fall of 2009. At the time I was 63. In May 2010 I moved from Massachusetts to Maryland to become a FT federal employee at NAVAIR as a Financial Systems Improvement Specialist. []  The leaders of NAVAIRs Individuals with Disabilities Barrier Removal Team knew that any so-called disabled person with a built-to-last positive attitude with more than their share of perseverance can bring a lot to the table and therefore that person is truly not a disabled person at all. I studied and worked very hard over the years to build my professional skills in a way that has proven to be of high value in numerous complex situations. Thus while NAVAIR provided me with a great opportunity they also knew that my slight physical limitation was of no consequence to them and that the more important point is that my skill set added value to their Financial Improvement Program (FIP) team.  From May 2010 to March 2017 I looked forward to going to work every day not only because of the incredibly important work NAVAIR does but also because I had the opportunity to work with so many genuine and talented people many of whom became good friends. NAVAIR [] is an outstanding organization a tremendous environment to have been a part of. I had a few very good jobs during my career but I will always consider working at NAVAIR as the most fulfilling job that I have ever had and I retired with a significant amount of pride and a feeling of honor to have contributed to such a great organization as NAVAIR.

Below is a short speech I wrote for the Wolfeboro Area Democrats rally in the garden of Edie and Paul Desmarais last Sunday August 30. It was a great event with six candidates speaking including Carrie Martin Duran who is also running for State Representative from Wolfeboro.  Hi Im John Wall. I am running from Wolfeboro for one of its two a seats in the New Hampshire state house. My focus is on Wolfeboro and its future development . There are a handful of public services are crucial for economic development and growth:  1) Education 2) Infrastructure 3) Social services  Providing public education is the single most important job of any local or state government. Wolfeboro has good quality education and local public support. This has not been easy particularly for the ten year period after the 2008 Great Recession when State revenues fell sharply. The New Hampshire state government pushed its revenue shortfalls down for the counties towns and school. districts. It took the Democrats flipping control of the House and Senate to increase State funding for education. But now we have the coronavirus to deal with. It adds to the costs of operating safe schools. State tax Revenues are again falling. I will work to make funds for education a priority.  One of Wolfeboros biggest infrastructure issues is broadband Internet. We all have come to use the Internet much more intensely since the beginning of this pandemic . We use it much more for work for education for entertainment for shopping and even consulting our doctors. Many of us have wished that our Internet connections were faster more reliable and less expensive. There are very different internet service standards and costs between urban and rural areas creating a digital divide. There was a electricity divide in the 1930s. Congress and state governments passed rural electrification programs to fix that. Congress and states funded our massive interstate highways system to cover the entire nation. Now is the time for Congress and states to fund a nationwide broadband access for every home. This is particularly important for the future development of Wolfeboro. This will allow Wolfeboro become a place more people choose to work young families choose to live and businesses want to invest. I want to go to Concord to move this program forward.  Wolfeboros and New Hampshires natural environment its one of the main things that make them very special places. We must keep our lovely lakes clean and their shore lines green. That requires good water sanitation and drainage. We have to invest in the environmental infrastructure needed. Wolfeboro has planned projects that have had to be postponed due to the state budgets.  Social services for the public in Wolfeboro are a patchwork with community  non-profits town county state and federal governments delivery rules and funding. Im talking about education health insurance unemployment  addiction family services child care and poverty. All of these basic needs are fundamental to maintaining ones dignity. There is not enough coordination between the various agencies. Wolfeboros highly seasonal economy means many families need a plan to pull together their family budgets. Wolfeboros small size and rural location make the availability of social services mean an hours drive or more each way.  The common problem behind all these issue is financing. The current government financing situation is full of turmoil and uncertainty. My vision for Wolfeboros development in beyond the current health and qeconomic crises. We will find a way to finance government services that the public strongly supports .  I dont have ready answers to these difficult problems. I do have lots of questions. If elected I intend to work long hard and smart for you in Concord.,political,Facebook

I am running to be reelected because I still have so much work to do for our district. I have worked tirelessly to bring our board to a state of higher transparency in order to make sure we operate with the feedback of all stakeholders. Now that this board is open to this critical input it is a top priority that we stay involved and engaged. Our policies goals and vision statement need to reflect this. I personally hope to achieve this by making sure that every student; without regard to race religion gender economic status and much more can walk through that door and have an equitable school experience that results in a positive move forward. Equally every staff member needs the same employment opportunity with zero stereotypes or stimas and needs to be supported with all the tools and training needed to do the job as well as a contract and working environment that motivates each staff member to stay. This means keeping informed and proactive as a board member in order to understand and take action on all the needs within our district.  As we well know these needs are bound to change with not only each year but also every situation (such as covid). I will continue to look at the individual needs of our district and make decisions based on what will best improve our goal of success and safety. Thus far half of my time serving on the board has been during this pandemic. As all of you know the learning curve to this is steep. I have had the distinct advantage of having a husband who is a pharmacist that currently serves on the federal disaster team and who also wrote the federal guidelines for what to do in all types of disasters (pandemics nuclear war dirty bombs viral warfare hurricanes floodling etc.) while he served on a presidential committee for then president Obama. This has given me unparalleled access to critical information as this crisis unfolds. Not only do I get information on changes from the CDC in real time I also get WHO information and information as to how other government agencies around the world are responding. This is vital to understanding how our own agencies make rulings and how effective or non politically motivated those rulings are. That way I have a crystal clear picture of how this impacts us locally and the domino effect for each ruling. It has been and will continue to be my top priority to get all of us through this covid crisis safely. I believe I can continue to do so while providing an opportunity for the best educational experience to happen in our district.  2. Do you have children who are enrolled in the Ellsworth school system? If so what grades are they in?  Yes. We have a child in middle school.  3. Do you have a working background in education? What do you do for work now?  My family has lived in Ellsworth for 16 years. I went to college for early childhood education and school psychology. My passion for education stems from the long line of educators in my family. While working and going to college I volunteered at schools in FL where my relatives worked for 7 years before coming to Maine. I worked as a sub in Ellsworth for 5 years and was so impressed by the warmth and dedication of our Ellsworth teachers. When I had a child at last and enrolled her in Ellsworth I jumped into volunteering in our schools and have loved getting to work with these wonderful people. I have been part of the PTF for going on 8 years. Organizing and volunteering in all kinds of things like Harry Potter week Halloween night Holiday gifting day field days the Walk A Thon the Grand program with or schools Book Fairs and much more. It gives me such joy to make the education experience engaging and inviting for our kids.  I am self employed. I work as a private contractor for business needing help creating and managing thier online business. I am also a costume maker on the side. I regularly volunteer for The Grand. During the pandemic I started the non profit group 'Masks For Hancock County' where we sewed and shipped thousands of masks for anyone who needed them as well as a variety of PPE for frontline workers in Hancock as well as all over Maine and across the country.  4. Are you in favor of continuing to require masking for students staff and visitors inside city schools and facilities as long as Maine CDC recommends the practice to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Hancock County? If you would change that requirement how would you do so?  At the current case load and vaccine availability yes I am in favor of wearing masks. I agree that masks help slow the spread of covid but I don't think masks should be universally mandated when Hancock reaches a status of Green and the vaccine has been offered to 5 and up. Our votes need to reflect real time situations unfolding in our county at the current time. Waiting on national standards or even state standards to relax our rules means our kids would stay masked until places like Tampa FL and Portland ME got their case loads down regardless of what was happening in our town.*  5. Do you favor continuing to have crosswalks painted in rainbow Pride colors at the citys high school and elementary/middle school? Why do you favor or oppose doing so?  100% yes. I advocated and voted for this already. For kids old enough to understand what the rainbows stand for it makes a clear statement of inclusion in an environment that had previously felt insular. For those too young to understand they see it as a brilliantly colored crosswalks. They brighten the atmosphere for everyone.  6. Are there other issues that you feel are important for the Ellsworth school system to address that you feel are not being adequately addressed? If so can you identify a few of them and say what steps you would pursue to address those issues as a member of the school board?  Pre-pandemic I was working on many areas that I would like to get back to. School climate for everyone. Students staff and families. We have started down the path of diving deeper into the culture within our walls to make sure we are providing the best environment to give each person a chance to thrive. This needs evaluating is many areas like employee contracts equity of education and inclusion anti bullying planning for success past high school curriculum and grading updates and better communication within the district as well as a continued transparency**.  7. What else would you like voters to know about you or about what you hope to accomplish as a school board member?  . I am a huge fan of data but not necessarily a fan of standardized tests. Teachers need to have easy access to standardized test data as it is one of many tools used to help steer the boat but it's not the entire story.  Teachers are the scientists of the school putting together daily plans of action to best produce optimal student outcomes based on previous data. When we as a board make changes we need to talk to these educators for their analysis and data and always use multiple resources of credible information to shape our plans.  One of my biggest accomplishments while serving on the school board was getting a bill sponsored that got signed into law. A law that improves public education for every student and teacher in Maine. This is a pretty rare accomplishment. I did this by listening to the families and staff about what some of the biggest challenges are in education. Our public schools have become choked with mandates that take up copius amounts of school time. Many mandates are out dated underfunded and even redundant. This law is a massive step in cleaning up that system and making education the best it can be. Of I get the privilege of a second term I have plans for another bill I hope to have sponsored to help our high school students through the state.  Someone was asking about where I stood on mandates for the covid vaccine in our schools. I thought this is a perspective that people have a right to know about. I love this vaccine. I couldn't wait to get it and got my child vaccinated as soon as we could. However I don't believe my personal feelings about the vaccine should ever infringe on you making your own choices for you and your family. Row v Wade gave us all the right to medical privacy. I would much rather make my husband (a pharmacist who is one of the people tasked with the vaccine roll out for MDI and who helped write policy on how to handle pandemics under president Obama) available to answer any and all questions a person might have about the vaccine. I want people to want this for themselves. I will make sure they have all the scientific information. And I will respect everyone's privacy no matter what they choose to do. I believe in my body my choice and plan to stand by that.  * information and recommendations from the WHO differed from the CDC on masks wearing. Both being very credible sources all the information needed to be read and analyzed. During the pandemic my husband had meetings with the CDC where the CDC changed their own rulings sometimes 3x in ONE day on the same issue. This is one of the reasons we need to understand not only each recommendation but also the reasons why those recommendations are made and the local impact.  **Fact. I was the first Ellsworth School Board member to regularly reach out to citizens through social media to keep people better informed. I ushered our school board into an age of information and transparency that had never existed at this level before I took office. Transparency matters. I didn't just promise something in my 3 years on the board I pushed HARD for this and took it to a whole new level. I already have plans in the works with my fellow policy committee member to bring about a new district run information outlet on social media for all parents and guardians to have centralized information with easy access in the future. If you looked back to the last time the board got to do the board self evaluation (recorded and archived online) you would know just how hard I pushed for this and what I was up against when I came on the board 3 years ago.,political,Facebook
"IS TAMPA BAY TIMES STILL RELEVANT?  What is the purpose of Journalism? Journalism is a method of inquiry and literary style used in social and cultural representation. It serves the purpose of playing the role of public service machinery in the dissemination and analysis of news and information.  What is a journalists oath? The Journalist's Creed is a personal affirmation of journalism ethics written by Walter Williams in 1914.  What are the universal principles that guide journalism? Five Core Principles of Journalism 1. Truth and Accuracy. 2. Independence. 3. Fairness and Impartiality. 4. Humanity. 5. Accountability.  What are the ethical responsibilities of a journalist? Ethical journalism has to be fair and truthful. A journalist must take responsibility for their work provide contextual information update their work to fit with current changes when necessary identify their sources with clarity and ensure that they understand the motives of their sources.  Why do journalists need professional ethics? One of the major reasons journalists need professional ethics is the fact that these ethics can act as a fantastic guide to help journalists deal with ethical situations that they encounter in the course of performing their duties.  I believe that The Tampa Bay Times (TBT) acts more and more like a social media platform and has been slowly moving away from The Five Core Principles of Journalism. After TBTs latest round of endorsements in this election cycle the paper took a giant leap further and further away from journalistic objectivity and integrity. I will use three specific political endorsements made by the editorial board of TBT and test the core principles against them. Keep in mind this is a solo effort. I have limited resources to compare with the limitless resource and access that the paper has. Also when the editorial board of any journalism paper is involved in a decision they have a fiduciary duty to adhere to the The Five Core Principles of Journalism.  School Board District 7. (NP) TBT endorsed Karl Nurse in this district. Lets test this endorsement against some of the five core principles of journalism. 3-Fairness and Impartiality. I cant see how endorsing a wealthy business owner who has no issue taking a political demotion as a prior City Council member to run for School Board is fair. He doesnt have any experience at the K-12 school level relevant to the position except the adoption of one school in one specific neighborhood. 4-Humanity. Any responsible business should practice social corporate responsibility especially journalism. We all have a duty to improve our environment its not all about dollars and cents. As a matter of fact the wiser business executives will tell you that social corporate responsibility and community engagement significantly improves the bottom line. Having said that by backing Karl Nurse TBT would like us to believe that a white-only school board is appropriate for our diverse public school system and our county. I dont think so! We need diversity that can lead to inclusion at all levels of government and the fact that the editorial board failed to deliver this diversity by not choosing a well-qualified teacher and public school advocate is a degradation of the integrity of journalism.  School Board District 1. (NP) Here TBT endorsed Laura Hine. Lets test this endorsement against some of the five core principles of journalism. 1-Truth and Accuracy. I happen to be a parent at the school where Mrs. Hine would like to claim credit. I can tell you this endorsement is totally wrong. Did the editorial group of TBT reach out to a representative population of the school to validate her claim? NO! I have been at the school for 19 years where this candidate tries to claim credit. Heres the truth I was there and TBT wasnt. During my daughters last 2 years the North Shore zone shifted 18 blocks to the south side to help improve minority students achievement. The presence of these kids prompted a bulk of white wealthy parents to leave the school. This exodus brought the school grade to a D. We stayed and continually supported the school which despite the grade continually has had wonderful teachers and enriching programs. Over time the achievement gap leveled off and the school was a B when we registered our son JB for kindergarten and has bounced between a B and C ever since including 2016-2017 when Laura Hine joined. My family and her group Friends of North Shore Elementary (FNSE) butted heads often over inclusion as a necessary component of diversity. Its not enough to get a token seat at the table; we need to be welcomed as equal stakeholders. There was a total lack of understanding of the nuances between equality and equity. All of Mrs. Hines programs were equal but not every student had equal access to these programs. The group could not understand that the initiatives and programs they championed ignored social cultural opportunity and socio-economic differences in our population that actually increased the achievement gap in spite of our attempts to inform them. Mrs. Hine got white parents to come back to the school in greater numbers but was this reverse migration better or worse for the marginalized students that were doing well before? Lets look at the available equity data at our disposal. The data reflects that disadvantaged students at North Shore Elementary are falling behind other students in the state and the achievement gap at the school is increasingly significant. The school is 51% White 28% Black 14% Hispanic and 5% Other. Low income students made up 68% of the school population. The data also reflects that some student groups are not getting the support they need to succeed. The suspension rate of White children is only 5% while all other groups combined suspension rate is 27%. These issues show up in areas of academic rigor as well as there are no black children identified as gifted at North Shore. With this endorsement the TBT is rewarding and praising these citizens for finally performing their civic duty to engage with their public school while failing the most vulnerable. For the sake of accuracy Mrs. Hine was always running for office from the time I met her. This notion that she opted to run to save our public schools against the tyranny of a pro-private school candidate is inaccurate and frankly laughable. 5-Accountability. If TBT had done due diligence in this endorsement they would have at least requested North Shore Elementary PTAs meeting minutes to verify her claims. In this case they would have noticed the many ways in which diversity and inclusion were not deliberate but more of a burden to bear by the FNSE members of the PTA. A recurring line item mentioning teachers/staff pay by the PTA would have also raised some concerns.  Pinellas Tax Collectors Office. Here TBT endorsed an employee of the Pinellas Tax Collectors Office Joyell Bobala who quit her job at the office just in time to run. This is the only example where I actually have available performance data on both candidates recorded by the entity in question. The critique of this endorsement is strictly data driven after I made a thorough public records request which TBT would have been ethically required to do but clearly didnt. My conclusion of this endorsement is that it goes against all five core principles of journalism: Truth and Accuracy Independence Fairness and Impartiality Humanity and Accountability. This endorsement is such a gross dereliction of duty. The TBT editorial board took the opinion of the former Tax Collector Diane Nelson as the primary motivator for its decision rather than facts and evidence. This endorsement is intentionally without journalistic integrity and is based solely on gossip and political favoritism. Lets dive into the data available for debate and analysis. It is evident that the current Tax Collector adopted a modernized and data-driven model to serve the county residents. This action insulted the previous Tax Collector and she is now fully engaged in an effort to replace him with mediocre low-level staff loyal to her and the past. We will stick with the available data. According to the endorsement Mrs. Nelson stated that wait times doubled. The record showed the following: Wait time in fact doubled while customer and employee satisfaction are at their highest. Why is this? Customer and employee satisfaction are the best indicators of performance by any service provider. Customer satisfaction is not simply based on wait times but in the accuracy of the transaction and the fewest number of visits needed to get the job done. Its an overall experience between the customer and the employee. The data shows that although wait times were less under Mrs. Nelson customer satisfaction and employees efficacy were also lower. Lets see the raw data for customer followed by employee satisfaction rating. Customer satisfaction in 2017: 98.63%; in 2018: 98.2%; 2019: 98.63% Overall employee satisfaction of Pinellas County Tax Collector employees from 2016 to 2019 is 90% The endorsement of the candidate also included one comment from an employee engagement survey. Any reasonable individual would agree that it is impossible to please everyone. However picking one negative comment when the preponderance of the survey results were very positive is deceptive and self-serving at best. According to the employee engagement data I received the majority of employees were quite satisfied and happy with their working environment. Here are some recent positive comments from the same survey regarding the current Tax Collector: 2020: The leadership is to be commended for their efforts to address last year's survey feedback. I have personally seen enhanced effort at building transparency and accessibility. The info presented at In Service Day this year was the most straightforward it has ever been and many decisions were clearly made with the employees' best interests in mind. 2020: My answers have changed a lot over the years. Every year I notice more and more improvement. I don't remember the last time I was able to choose ""Strongly Agree"" & ""Agree"" for every question. Thank you for continuing to make this a great place to work and each time we need you to you show us you care about our health safety & well-being. It is noticed and appreciated. 2020: By far this is my favorite job ever. From the training program to the people there isn't anything I would change.  If I were to play the same unethical game that TBT is engaged in I would look at employee engagement surveys from when Mrs. Nelson was in charge and pick the following comments: 2015: Sometimes I feel like the ""time waited"" issue gets in the way of customer service. There is such a concern in getting the customers in and out as fast as we can it can lead to rushing through situations where mistakes are made on a registration title or drivers license. This then reflects poorly on the employees review. I understand and it sure seems the customers do too that waiting for issues at the DMV is a way of life and we do it really well here but rushing through customers albeit can lead to good times but it can also lead to mistakes on the paperwork. I don't think we should slow down for slow down sake maybe just put less emphasis on the time issue and more on the 0% mistake issue. 2015: Mean what you say even in the top left corner of the page I am looking at it says world class service anytime anyplace. That is not what is preached its all about getting people out the door and keeping times below the red. Don't answer questions for people outside of work don't offer services of other county offices 2016: Be fairer and avoid favoritism when promoting an employee. Be more careful in choosing the right person with the preparation and abilities needed to effectively exercise a supervisory or position. We observed several times how unfair is gone when the promote an employee. 2016: Stop the favoritism. A lot of people get promotions or moved to a different area of the office because they are liked more then (sic) others or because of who they are related too. This has happened for a long time but it is happening more now then (sic) ever  The data also shows a more diverse executive leadership team something that Mrs. Nelson was not concerned with and I am afraid with this endorsement neither is TBT. The agencys website depicts an agile and responsive front line to the rapidly changing needs of the Citizens. I also see an agency moving towards increasing accessibility specifically online and through kiosks in grocery stores. This approach is proactive and forward looking. A significant data point that is often overlooked is the amount of retirees that occur with new leadership. The amount of retirees did not significantly change over the past three years. Usually the dire and ineffective environment portrayed by Mrs. Bobala which is amplified by Mrs. Nelson should have yielded a noticeable increase in the number of retirees yet there was no such an exodus of eligible employees to retire. 2016-2017 9 retirements. 2017-2018 8 retirements. 2018-2019 9 retirements Lets look at Joyell Bobala as a candidate. According to public records the candidate was given a lateral transfer for failure to perform. Mrs. Bobala was supervising the Tax Administration department. At that capacity she interviewed hired and trained 3 new employees from 2016 to 2018 and Mrs. Bobala failed to retain any of her own recruits while the entire Tax Collectors office turnover rate for new hires was: 21% for the same time period (including her 100% turnover rate). Given her past statements about the value of standardized training this failure is not a surprise.  Do we still need journalists? As popular as social media is we still need journalists. Social media news is constantly clouded with peoples opinions so we need journalists to report clarify and fact check everything we see and hear on social media. What can we do when our journalists are acting like a biased opinion-based platform that is no different from unchecked social media? I say we need to call them out and hold them accountable to the values and principles of their profession. Their objectivity is needed in order to sustain our democratic system. There is nothing more valuable than a free press to our system of government. This is why we should not accept this bought and paid for form of journalism. I am annoyed and disappointed that I must fact check my local paper and it brings no joy. Editorials represent the institutional opinion of the Tampa Bay Times. The collective opinions of the Chairman and CEO Paul Tash Editor of Editorials Tim Nickens and editorial writers Elizabeth Djinis John Hill and Jim Verhulst tell us that we should elect a fully White School Board that includes an inexperienced parent who became aware of our public schools issues only when it affected her family and lastly TBT would like to tell us that our tax collectors office is better off in the hands of a low level unproductive and bitter ex- employee that does not believe in standardized training for all as a means to bring equity in our public service system. Is TBT against racial justice equitable schools and fair workplaces? I cant tell but what I can tell for sure is that TBT has not been a friend in the fight for a better and inclusive community that can work for all. Its not a zero sum game.

Primaried and Postcarded  These are ways that special interest groups try to cow Legislators into supporting their interests. They threaten to see they have a strong opponent in the primary and to send out postcards attacking the Legislator.  I represent you rather than the special interest groups so I have been Primaried in this election. My opponent Mr. Bergkamp rented an apartment here in April just in time to file to run against me. He still owns a house in Bel Air and is much farther from his work at Koch Industries.  I have also been Postcarded. So far Republicans in District 93 have received seven postcards attacking me with distorted information. I do not wish to repeat the distortions made by Mr. Bergkamps special interest groups but I hope you will consider these questions when reading the cards:  - If I am against cutting taxes on the already wealthy does that mean I want to raise your taxes?  - If a Fox News poll finds that Joe Biden is leading President Trump by 8 points does that mean that Fox News hates President Trump?  - Do you really want corporate special interest groups deciding how much Tyson can pollute our local environment?  - If I voted to create an Independent Energy Office in Kansas to study how to lower energy costs does that mean I want to raise your electric bill?  - Are my Kansas Values different from those I displayed for three decades teaching at Newman and Friends Universities?  - Do the articles referenced in the postcards actually say what the special interest groups claim?  I hope you answered no to all of those. There is a bright side to all of this. It gives me the opportunity to bring the tactics of special interest groups out into the open. I also appreciate their support of the Post Office and the publicity they have given my website Please read the articles there and judge for yourself if they have represented them accurately.  And if you wish to have someone represent you rather than special interest groups please vote for me on August 4th.,political,Facebook
4 Members of Zoning Committee Have Resigned  With the resignation of Larry Kurlander Chairman and 3 other members the City is left without a functioning Zoning Committee. The Zoning Committee tried mightily to move from an environment that caters to speculators to one like Estero and Naples that welcomes true high quality development to Bonita Springs. We owe them our thanks.  Unfortunately the Zoning Committees valiant efforts have been undercut by City Council. Council has not seen fit to require appropriate architectural drawings with respect to plans submitted by speculators and developers. Back of the envelope drawings apparently are good enough. Naples requires architectural drawings. Estero not only requires this but architectural drawings and landscape plans first have to go through its Architectural Review Board.  The process by which plans from speculators and developers and zoning variance and exception requests are handled in Bonita Springs needs to be fixed. Ethics reform dealing with meetings between City Council members and speculators and developers need to be part of the package.  First however the Council must make clear whether it actually wants hard working citizens who truly represent the people to serve on the Zoning Committee.,political,Facebook

Open letter Prime Minister Hubert Minnis - Cruise Ship Incursions into Our Family Island Communities  The Most Hon. Hubert Alexander Minnis Prime Minister Office of the Prime Minister Sir Cecil Wallace Whitfield Centre P O Box CB 10980 Nassau N.P. The Bahamas Via email primeminister@bahamas.gov.bs  Re : Cruise Ship Incursions into Our Family Island Communities  Dear Prime Minister Minnis  There has perhaps never been a time when good faith communication between Government and its constituents was more important than now. As we emerge slowly from the worst pandemic in a century and the nations economic security remains in peril I understand and appreciate Governments efforts to seize upon the fastest means to place this nation back on her feet. However given the unprecedented burdens shouldered by your government I feel compelled to emphasize what would ordinarily be self-evident. Blind haste and desperation make for bad decisions and bad policy.  The authority your government gave CrystalCruises to penetrate our unique and treasured family island communities carries great risks. I will use Spanish Wells as an example but strong inferences must be drawn from that example and applied to the other intended ports of call.  With no public consultation the people of Spanish Wells were notified via a secret RFP aimed at a few select tour operators that Crystal Cruises had been granted permission to anchor off of Egg Island and ferry as many as 650 passengers to the community beginning the first week of July. For many this information might as well have been news that a huge extinction-level meteorite was hurtling towards the island and would enter the atmosphere on the fifth day of July a deal concocted in secret that would have a cataclysmic impact on their lives. Given the arctic welcome Disney received in 2016 when pursuing Egg Island for an ill-conceived cruise port one would think our government had heard the message loud and clear - Spanish Wells doesnt want cruise tourism.  How did we get from Disney to Crystal? Crystal Cruises is literally the bottom of the barrel. They receive an F for sewage treatment air pollution and transparency on the globally-respected Friends of the Earth Cruise Ship Report Card. Information on water quality is not available. Sadly Crystal is the dregs of the most polluting tourism modality on Earth and your government is allowing this filth and exploitation to flood our fragile and pristine family islands.  While your government may be patting itself on the back for the concierge-like manner in which it materialized a cruise ship from the haze of financial angst that hovers over the nation it is abundantly clear to the residents of Spanish Wells that little or no thought was given to what they actually needed or wanted. Worse still it appears that absolutely no thought was given to the potential economic social and environmental downside of the Crystal Cruise deal.  THE ECONOMIC RISKS: As your government must know Spanish Wells has spent decades meticulously building its own unique enviable and sustainable model of tourism. Do you understand the potential blight the Crystal deal represents to their unique brand? Many Spanish Wells residents have invested their life savings to leverage the islands unique style of escapist tourism.  Spanish Wells visitors come to the island over and over again exactly because it is NOT a cruise port of call does NOT embrace mass tourism and does NOT need or want a sudden increase in visitors. Within the space of a few hours a petition opposing this scheme garnered hundreds of signatures from residents and visitors alike and there is no end in sight.  The vast majority of Spanish Wells people dont need or want the pocket change that cruise passengers spend. They are fully aware that it takes 28 cruise passengers to spend as much as one of their stayover guests. Do you have any idea how much money the islands second home owners spend within the community every year and that they will very likely stay away if the picturesque islands soul bears the unmistakable taint and stink a cruise port of call will bring?  THE SOCIAL RISKS: Did the government give pause for a moment to consider the social impacts of converting Spanish Wells into a cruise port of call? Do you comprehend the pride they feel in their small quaint simple uncrowded and Godly island? There are approximately 2000 people who reside in Spanish Wells. Do you think they actually want 650 cruise passengers (equivalent to nearly a third of the islands total population) crawling around their island?  Moreover it appears your government never gave any thought to the fact that Spanish Wells has a very busy and bustling harbour and waterfront.. Can you even imagine 650 cruise passengers most of whom are in their 60s milling around the waterfront as the islands fishermen struggle to perform their many tasks in some semblance of the manner in which they are accustomed?  Spanish Wells is a small community with limited infrastructure. Do you know how many public toilets there are? Have you even asked yourselves whether the infrastructure is prepared to accommodate a sudden explosion in human activity? Have you ever been to the beach in Spanish Wells? Its empty. Neither the settlement nor its beaches have ever experienced anything close to 650 visitors at once. To Spanish Wells a fleet of tenders coming ashore from the Crystal Serenity may as well be hostile landing craft coming ashore in a surprise attack.  Last did you give any deference to the fact that the people of Spanish Wells revere and love their Egg Island. An assault on that island gem is a knife in the belly of the community.  THE ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS: Clearly your government has given zero thought to the unavoidable environmental impact of this shameful scheme to allow Crystal to penetrate our family islands.  In 2016 Egg Island received international recognition as a Hope Spot designation along with 13 other sites globally. Hope spots are marine areas of ecological significance recognized and promoted for long-term protection under a global conservation campaign overseen by Mission Blue a non profit organization founded by Dr.Sylvia Earl. Egg Island has also been designated as a proposed Marine Protected Area by Bahamas Protected Area Fund as a part of the Caribbean Challenge Initiative which targets the protection of at least 20% of our marine and coastal environment by 2020.  As for anchoring at Egg Island what can I say except for the starkly obvious: the idea is reckless and shortsighted. How has this project been fast tracked without the public consultation mandated by several international agreements The Bahamas on committed to including Agenda 21 and the Sustainable Development Goals or an environmental impact assessment and management plan? Not to mention our own Environmental Planning and Protection Act. Clearly no thought was given to the fact that even an anchored ship such as the Crystal Serenity will disgorge as much air pollution as tens of thousands of automobiles. The propeller wash alone can smother reefs up to 1.5 kilometers away. The impacts to fisheries is also a risk that simply cannot be ignored.  The islands sea bed currently does not bear the hideous anchor scars that now deface hundreds of square acres of the Berry Island seabed after the Bahamian Government allowed cruise ships to anchor there we dont need to add Egg Island to the list. Enough is enough.  I could go on and list all of the likely environmental impacts but I know from experience they bear less weight in your governments view than the above economic concerns. Your government does not see our environment as our most precious financial resource even though we use our exquisite beauty to lure visitors to our country which puts food on our tables.  I urge your government to consider that according to the Economic Valuation of Ecosystem Services in Bahamian Marine Protected Areas (MPA) conducted by BREEF the Nature Conservancy and the National Trust in 2017 the existing network of MPAs is worth $6 billion per year in ecosystem services including crawfish habitat shoreline protection tourism and carbon storage. MPAs provide important sanctuaries to keep healthy populations of queen conch grouper spiny lobster and other marine species that are commercially valuable. Fishing is the foundation of many Bahamians livelihoods; in Spanish Wells it is their life blood. The industry is already under stress due to poaching and other stresses. There is no wisdom in adding more poison to the well. Impediments to conservation efforts could have rippling economic effects.  I reiterate my call from September 2020 for an Environmental Impact Assessment to be carried out on the entire cruise industry that will help us determine the way forward.  If nothing else I pray that this letter will make your government turn and face itself in the mirror and ask whether the Crystal Cruise deal is really in the best long-term interest of our country. Are you helping Crystal Cruises or are you helping us? I want to know. The people of the family islands want to know. In fact we have a right to know.

Fellow Residents of Putnam County  I ask for your vote for re-election as Putnam County Probate Juvenile Judge.  It has been my pleasure to serve as your Probate Juvenile Judge since 2011. You have already elected me twice. I hope you will again place your faith in me and honor me with your vote. Since becoming Probate Juvenile Judge I have successfully presided over nearly 10000 probate and juvenile cases among them; juvenile delinquencies juvenile traffic cases abuse neglect and dependency cases adoptions guardianships mental illness cases estates etc. I have also performed well over 100 marriage ceremonies.  I regularly sit in both Putnam County Municipal Court and Common Pleas Court saving the Putnam County taxpayers thousands of dollars in expenses associated with paying for a visiting Judge.  In my time as Probate/Juvenile Judge I initiated the Make the Grade program to assist juvenile offenders in succeeding in school. I worked in conjunction with Common Pleas Court and Crime Victim Services to develop the CASA advocate program to give children a voice in custody disputes. I also worked cooperatively with Common Pleas Court to implement the pro se clinic to assist those who appear in court without counsel.  I oversaw the renovation of the Probate Juvenile Courtroom making it a place suitable for the dignity of the proceedings that are held there.  I applied for and received a technology grant from the Ohio Supreme Court to update the technology in both common pleas court rooms making them remotely accessible in this time of social distancing.  I have continued to work cooperatively with schools in our County meeting annually with the Superintendents and Principals to provide additional support to assist them in creating a safe learning environment for students and faculty. Under my direction my probation department has assumed the responsibility for the truancy system saving our school systems and ultimately your taxpayer dollars. I was a core member of the Safe Schools Healthy Students program established by the Educational Service Center.  These are challenging times the impact of the opiate crisis and re-emergence of methamphetamine have had and continue to have a significant impact on our community. Among other negative effects it has resulted in an increase in the number complexity and severity of abuse neglect and dependency cases. I am the only candidate with experience presiding over these cases and protecting these most vulnerable members of our community.  I share your values. I spent most of my life in this county I have 4 times run for office. I coached you or your children or grandchildren in baseball softball soccer volleyball basketball. My children went to school with you or your children and as a parent and grandparent I share the concerns you have for them. I have judged Putnam County Eagle Scout projects and sponsored many eagle scouts at their awards banquet. I represented you your family or your neighbors in all matters big and small when I practiced law. I have spoken in our high schools on the dangers of alcohol and again in the midst of the opiate crisis. I am a co-sponsor of the #makesomenoiseagainstdrugs program currently in our County schools.  I am extremely proud of my work on the bench and as a result I have the support of many in law enforcement those at crime victim services and members of the bar.  It is going to be an exhausting couple of months as we head into the home stretch of both the local and national elections. We will all be inundated with campaign literature advertising signs billboards etc. The divisiveness on the state and national levels is at least in my lifetime unprecedented. I am not running a national campaign or one based on ideological positions. I am running because I believe that the residents of Putnam County deserve the most qualified and experienced Probate Juvenile Judge.  There is no substitute for experience and I am the only candidate who has served as Probate Juvenile Judge and can offer the efficacy that comes with that experience  Thank you again for the honor you have granted me. I ask you to allow me to continue to serve you by voting for me on November 3 2020.  Sincerely Michael A Borer Putnam County Probate and Juvenile Judge  Please return to this page from time to time as I will use it to tell you more about me as my campaign progresses  Paid for by the Committee to Re-Elect Michael A Borer Michael Borer 177 Eastowne Dr Ottawa OH 45875 Treasurer,political,Facebook

ENVIRONMENTAL RACISM IN MAINE Environmental racism exists here in Maine where low-income communities and communities of color are impacted by lead poisoning at higher proportions. As a former house painter of 20+ years I am well aware of the lead problem in our state. Grants loans and tax incentives should be provided to property owners to help them fund lead removal or remediation. Environmental racism is a real concern with certain vulnerable populations -- mainly people of color indigenous and the poor -- bearing the brunt of living with pollution poisonous chemicals and toxic waste in their environment in their everyday lives. No amount of toxic chemicals is acceptable in this day and age--not anywhere. Environmental preservation and protection needs to be equally applied to all communities. What is unacceptable in Cumberland or Falmouth should be equally unacceptable in Lewiston or Bangor. It's time to clean up the lead. Homeowners most of whom simply bought a house that had lead painted on it 100+ years ago aren't to blame either. People didn't know 100 years ago how bad lead was but now we do and we must clean up the mess. Homeowners that invest in eliminating the lead in their houses should get a tax benefit. They are cleaning up a mess created by someone else years ago but contributing to the public good today. Clean out the lead!,political,Facebook
State Journal question  - What changes if any should Frankfort make in its economic development strategy? (200 words)  KCDC has created an extremely well laid out comprehensive economic development plan for the city and county. The plan consists of six main goals with detailed strategies for meeting them the actions to be taken and who needs to initiates them. If we follow this action plan we simply can not fail.  I think our biggest obstacle comes with goal number three: Build a more welcoming and supportive climate for economic development. Its important to note that the city and county share equally ALL occupational taxes so it behooves the city to be supportive of development in the county as well.  The city and county have repeatedly shown a lack of support for economic development. Development plans are made agreed upon and then get tangled when attempts are made to bring them to fruition. This sends a message that Frankfort/Franklin county is not open for business. In the city we have a disturbing regulatory environment created by P & Z ARB and the historical society that stifles and repels investors.  In a nutshell we have an excellent plan but our elected leadership does not want development. If we want Frankfort to be a place our kids want to live and raise their children then our leadership needs to change.,political,Facebook

Candidate: Adam C. Ereth Age: 36 Occupation: Non-Profit Programs Director  Mesas water service is at a crossroads with emerging water quality issues and $200 million worth of rehabilitating/replacing aging infrastructure. The District has large surplus funds yet is still in the most expensive  of county-wide water rates. There is a need to reduce current rate increases reprioritize funds into mitigating concrete asbestos pipes and increase water conservation/sustainability measures.  I have been a proud Costa Mesan for over 30 years. My family the Perrys moved to the Westside in the late-50s. Weve served as local teachers business owners coaches volunteers and strong community supporters. I share in that pride for our community. I have Bachelors and Masters degrees in Geography and Im currently finishing a PhD in water-focused research in the Norman J. Arnold School of Public Health. I have water-related engineering experience and served as an Environmental Health Manager alongside local/state/federal agencies on a variety of ecological/public health issues.  My professional experiences will help Mesa prioritize risks and resources to reduce the massive cost the agency faces with aging infrastructure replacement/rehabilitation and lower water rates in the process.  I kindly ask for your vote to achieve these goals.   Email: Ereth4MesaWater@gmail.com Cell: 949-434-9888,political,Facebook
Sewell Tract Conservation Resiliency Resiliency: Under the Mullock Administration we will do flood mitigation projects. Over the last four years Cape May has done zero flood mitigation projects. This is leaving our City at risk for the future. Flood mitigation projects make a lot of sense. 1. They serve to protect our town from future storms and flooding 2. They increase home values 3. Many flood mitigation projects pay for themselves. Many grants are available and they can bring down our CRS Rating. The lower the CRS rating the lower our flood insurance premiums.  Sewell Tract: Over the last four years this Administration did NOT work with the NJ Department of Environmental Protection the Army Corp of Engineers the American Littoral Society Green Acres or any other Environmental Groups like the Nature Conservancy. This Administration chose only to work with a third party headed by the Deputy Mayors husband. That group is on the side of the developer in the litigation. To best serve the citizens of Cape May and to preserve the Sewell Tract Cape May must represent itself. As Councilmember I reached out to all the parties involved in the litigation because the City and its citizens must be directly represented. As Mayor we will work with all parties to come to the best solution for our citizens and Cape Mays Environment and make sure the Sewell Tract is preserved. As an aside my family has worked to preserve over 100 acres of land in Cape May County. Land Preservation is not just something I talk about. Weve done it and we will get it done for Cape May!  Renewable Energy: During the last 4 years we have done NO renewable energy projects. Cape May should be the leader of coastline communities and be the example of how we will face the 21st century. As Mayor I will work to make Cape May a beacon of how seashore towns can both protect their cities from storms and be good stewards of the environment.,political,Facebook
An Attorney Advocate and Fighter.  When I saw how the Mecklenburg County Property Revaluation was failing us - I knew I could help fix it. The County Commissioners selected me in a Bi-Partisan ballot as Vice Chairman of the Board of Equalization and Review.  I personally voted to lower the taxes for thousands of citizens throughout Mecklenburg County. I demanded proof for every dollar of your home value and fought as your Advocate.  When I got tired of the poor roads and potholes plaguing our community I personally went to Lowes and spent my money on supplies. I bought the tools and the asphalt. I fixed the problem when gov failed us.  When the Arts Sales Tax referendum was being pushed I teamed up with Matthew Ridenhour to stop it. I purchased signs and helped make the push to stop the senseless tax increase. I campaigned and helped push the message that a sales tax for private arts was unacceptable.  When good people in our community expressed a need for the homeless I came forward with thousands of dollars in personal donations to shelters food banks individual food and clothing supplies and personal support.  I will be your Advocate on the County Commission. Im a father of five who wants to create a pro-job growth low tax low crime environment that moves our entire community forward.  Im concerned about the rising crime (100+ murders) the annual property tax increases and COVID-19 fallout.  I want to finally solve our overcrowded schools and help rebuild and reopen Mecklenburg County for the thousands of business and risk of closure and families at risk of financial ruin.  Im concerned that the County Commission is ignoring the values and needs of District 6. I want to fight for our future.  Please join me.

There is so much I could say when describing Lynn Fitch that it is impossible to keep it short. When she takes on an endeavor she takes it on 110%. Whether that is taking care of her family taking on the responsibility of a job or pursuing personal passions she doesnt just do it 1/2 way. Lynns family is large and supportive and has for generations been deeply invested in the success of Sawyer County. As part of that Lynn doesnt stand on the sidelines hoping our communities and residents will flourish she gets personally involved. She does her part. She understands what a support network is supposed to look like and provides it. Ive known Lynn to be presented with professional tasks that seem beyond solution. However she takes ideas and runs with them to provide the needed solutions. Her resume of experiences span an impressive variety of sectors including banking business ownership education and the arts. With superior soft skills including communication problem-solving and decision making as well as the years of accumulated technical skills it takes to execute the mission in a professional environment Lynn has all bases covered. That said her initiative and persistence is what propels her to any summit she pursues. Ive worked with Lynn when she was my supervisor at WITC and when I was a contractor to the Sawyer County/Lac Courte Oreilles Economic Development Corporation. Lastly Im wildly jealous of her artistic talent! I have no doubt she is beyond qualified for the position of Sawyer County Clerk and would make the utmost of the opportunity if afforded your vote on August 11th! --Angie Holcomb Freelance Graphic Designer/Artist Hayward WI,political,Facebook

"RANDOM PSYCHOLOGY 82 part 3 RANDOM PSYCHOLOGY 82 part 3 #SAVETHECHILDREN This is continuing the topic of #savethechildren  the most fad in the #American culture where people pickup a slogan without knowing or understanding the meaning or the purpose don't know what they want and how to get there don't know that they are the problem and have no part or purpose in solving the problem but it makes us feel good about ourselves. It is like being for the environment being for the BLM being against racism our war on poverty our war on drugs our o' what the heck we are part of something like those that brag on social media about their propensity to eat ""ss. I posted my article on "" a new world order 2003 today at the begingbof it I rated a conversation I had in 1977 with a fellow soldier he asked me what I thought of the Americans I told him that the Americans can't handle criticism he was upset. On my first tour to Germany there was a book sold in the PX showing how an American soldier should behave in Germany on the first page it said ""Don't act like an American"" I am an American I act like an American and I am proud of it I am just like you. In one of the most memorable lines ever from our movies there is one oft quoted line Colonel Jessup said ""you can't handle the truth"" the line is from the movie ""A few good men"" most of can't handle the truth but that is not the whole thing read  Son we live in a world that has walls and those walls have to be guarded by men with guns. Who's gonna do it? You? You Lieutenant Weinberg? I have a greater responsibility than you can possibly fathom. You weep for Santiago and you curse the Marines. You have that luxury. You have the luxury of not knowing what I know -- that Santiago's death while tragic probably saved lives; and my existence while grotesque and incomprehensible to you saves lives.  You don't want the truth because deep down in places you don't talk about at parties you want me on that wall -- you need me on that wall.  We use words like ""honor"" ""code"" ""loyalty."" We use these words as the backbone of a life spent defending something. You use them as a punch line.  I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very freedom that I provide and then questions the manner in which I provide it.  I would rather that you just said ""thank you"" and went on your way. Otherwise I suggest you pick up a weapon and stand the post. Either way I don't give a (DARN) what you think you're entitled to! "" No I am not asking you take a gun and guard the borders I am not even asking to walk around a nuclear arms depot on packed snow in Micky Mouse boots with an empty M-16 and a baseball bat I am not even asking you to stay up nights and guard your kids. Earlier in my writing this I brought up the point that on a practical level reducing poverty increasing employment opportunities and better education will do the most to save the kids. I brought up the point that on the international level reducing hunger and eliminating wars will help more than anything else to cut down the child trafficking. I haven't yet heard any counter proposals. Obviously the the campaign is and was started as an attempt to misdirect the criticism of the #republican candidate. To make him look like the savior of the American kids while he is as guilty as anyone in the practice.  That it is extremely rare in the United states where a child is taken for the purpose of sex trafficking is not a great selling point it defeats the purpose of making political hay where the sole pu6this issue has been raised  at this particular point to blame a political party. Most often  and that is only a few times a year that a person infatuated with a child will kidnap the child and sexually abuse that child not traffic them. The result in these cases is that the child is sadly murdered within hours. But we are talking about ""sex trafficking"". Should we not talk about the nude models that come here legally should we not talk about the "" mail order brides"". No that also does not serve our purpose I guess. Most of the so called children that are trafficked are young runaways that are picked up by the pimps and agree to "" work"" trust me the police know the pimps know where they live where their girls work all of that. The pimps provide ""protection"" for the ""girls"" I know. So it goes back to you the citizen. The girls are runaways from poverty from hardship at home the bad relationships with parents the abuse and even sexual abuse at their own homes.

American philosopher and educational reformer John Dewey had several reoccurring themes in his writings. One of the most prominent was that education should not be acquiring a pre-determined set of skills but instead realize ones full potential and use those skills for the good of society. He believed that students in an environment who are allowed to experience and interact with the curriculum would thrive.  He wrote these ideas in the early twentieth century. Here we are a hundred or so years later doing precisely the opposite. We are forcing young children to adhere to an arbitrary set of standards written in secret and forced onto states by a federal government that threatened to withhold funding. Kids are being lectured throughout the school day then sent home with 40 lbs of books and hours of homework. They have little or no opportunity to be a kid. Instead they are working on the curriculum for more hours in a day than some adults work. This must stop. #LetKidsBeKids  With your help we will trash the current curriculum and replace it with one designed by local parents and educators.,political,Facebook

One of the issues I have heard a lot about is the high electric rates that NH pays especially when compared with our neighbors. You already know that I am a strong supporter of sustainable energy. Today I want to briefly discuss the RGGI (Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative). The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) is a cooperative effort among the states of Connecticut Delaware Maine Maryland Massachusetts New Hampshire New Jersey New York Rhode Island and Vermont to cap and reduce power sector CO2 emissions. One of the original intents was to tax high the high carbon emitters - electric companies using fossil fuels and use that money to cut carbon emissions that damage our NH environment (acid rain) To do this the plan WAS to spend the money on weather proofing low income housing that use much more fossil fuels than the average NH house. Unfortunately when the Republicans were in power that money got diverted to rate reduction which amounted to about 17 cents off the average monthly bill. I support the realignment of this money back to its original purpose of winterizing low income housing. This makes a huge difference to these homeowners AND cuts our greenhouse gas emissions.  I will continue to discuss these issues because they MATTER TO OUR CITIZENS. It is NOT ideology. It IS good public policy. And good public policy is what I am about.

Every once in a while someone asks me about my position on critical race theory (CRT) and diversity equity and inclusion initiatives. So lets chat.  First things first CRT isnt being taught in Olentangy schools. Its something they teach in law school and PhD programs; it hasnt replaced third grade curriculum as one person told me. (I know because I have a third grader and hes learning multiplication and early opinion writing. If advanced law school concepts come next semester though someone let me know so I can start brushing up on the rule against perpetuities now.)  I suspect that some people stopped reading after that paragraph but stay with me. Arguing about whether something is or isnt CRT is beside the point. If you have a concern with something in your childs class talk to their teacher. Be specific and explain exactly what it is that troubles you. And if youre still concerned raise it with the principal. They should listen to you in good faith and having a dialogue on these issues may clear up a misunderstanding or may lead the teacher or principal or superintendent to realize they made a misstep. Nobodys perfect and mistakes can happen. If they do we should address them.  But sometimes theres just a difference of opinion and no change may occur because teachers have reasonable (but not absolute) latitude. In that case the Controversial Issues and Literature Selection policies allow for alternate assignments in certain circumstances. The Board doesnt intervene in individual situations but should certainly create an environment that allows for good faith discussion.  Importantly though we cant let these issues prevent our district from talking about diversity equity and inclusion. Those arent shadowy code words  theyre the sorts of things Mr. Rogers and Sesame Street talked about when we were kids. Recognizing that were all different and that its not ok to treat people poorly because of their skin color gender religion or more is not subversive. Talking about barriers to success and how to overcome them so that everyone has a fair chance to do their best is not radical. And building an environment where people show empathy and kindness toward others is not wokeness  its just being a good neighbor.  We have to talk openly about these fundamental values. The Dear OLSD letters make that crystal clear  we have real issues in this regard and if we dont work together to address them numerous kids and families are going to wonder Am I safe here? Am I welcome? Do I belong? If the answer is no what does that do to their mental health? What does that say about our community?  This isnt a game. Conspiracy theories and snarky attacks and online vitriol have real-world consequences. We need leaders who will speak plainly about the importance of building a supportive community because if we dont its going to have a profoundly harmful impact on people. Im running because I want to help make our district more welcoming and I hope you join me in that effort.,political,Facebook
"Wedding Venue Refusing to Refund Deposit Money?  Weddings are supposed to be the most joyous of times yet todays environment has led to the unimaginable and potentially fraudulent practice of wedding venues and banquet halls refusing to refund deposit monies amid the COVID-19 pandemic.  Over the last several months I have successfully represented clients against these businesses recovering tens of thousands of dollars after the wedding venue refused any refund whatsoever.  Disruptions caused by the COVID-19 outbreak have in some circumstances made it entirely impossible or impractical for parties to fulfill their duties and obligations under contracts for goods and services. To seek relief from such scenarios it is important to look to the contracts force majeure clause which typically establishes legal defenses to a partys contractual obligations. Oftentimes this clause is triggered due to impossibility of carrying out a wedding as a result of COVID-19 and related government directives.  My approach:  These claims can be extremely time sensitive depending on the anticipated wedding date; deposit deadlines; deadline to deliver guest lists and other related terms and conditions. Formal notice should be forwarded advising the venue that because the terms of the contract cannot be fulfilled under New Jersey law we are exercising the right to cancel the agreement and demand a full refund of any and all deposit monies.  Review the contract in-depth to determine whether the agreement contains a ""force majeure"" or ""act of God"" provision that may prevent or impair party performance. Look to see whether any of the following events are specifically referenced in the clause: public health crisis - disease outbreak - pandemic - epidemic.  Enforcement of these contractual terms usually requires reasonable notice to the other party advising that we are affirmatively exercising the force majeure clause. This should be done immediately and formally by way of mail or email unless the contract says otherwise. In triggering this clause we must demonstrate the scope and extent of the impairing or interfering circumstances due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To that extent we must carefully analyze the original agreement and any subsequently amended contracts. Further I must specifically point to my clients' position that fulfilling required duties is impossible and/or impractical and/or the hardship is so clear and egregious that it would be so fundamentally unfair to carry out such obligations as well as a threat to the health and safety of the general public. I have also experienced situations in which the venue has deceptively removed refund deposit language from an amended contract that was present in the original contract without informing my clients.  Additional Strategic Considerations:  Using government directives to support my legal position against the venue in retrieving client deposit money:  On March 9 2020 Governor Phil Murphy declared a State of Public Health Emergency for the State of New Jersey by way of Executive Order No. 103 to ramp up New Jerseys efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19. The State of Emergency remains in effect.  On March 13 2020 under section 319 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 247d) the U.S. President Donald Trump by and through the Secretary of Health and Human Services declared a Public Health Emergency to control the spread of the virus in the United States. The Public Health Emergency remains in effect.  Governor Murphys Executive Order No. 157 has allowed entertainment business to open provided that policies include but are not limited to limiting the number of patrons in any indoor premises to 25% of the stated maximum capacity.  Whats the significance?  In every case I have handled thus far the wedding venue has required my clients to pay for a minimum number of guests irrespective of whether that many guests will actually attend the event.  Example:  Wedding venue requires clients to pay for a minimum of 150 guests; the venues website shows a maximum capacity of 200 people; per Executive Order No. 157 the venue cannot legally allow more than 50 guests to attend (25% capacity) yet the venue is still charging clients for an additional 100 guests that will not be present. This sounds in fraud and consumer fraud under New Jersey law. Why should you pay for goods and services NOT being rendered to and for you?  You shouldn't...  Governor Murphys Executive Order No. 157 also specifically banned the use of dance floors at indoor establishments as they are by their very nature are designed to facilitate especially close person-to-person contact.  Governor Murphys Executive Order No. 158 stated that due to recent spikes in COVID-19 cases attributed to indoor food and beverage establishments and given the well-established risks that such establishes present . . . it is necessary to temporarily pause the resumption of indoor dining in New Jersey.  Based on the above a wedding venue cannot as things stand today provide the goods and services in which you contracted and paid for. In certain circumstances and specifically when these facts are present I have asserted claims sounding in breach of contract fraud and consumer fraud under the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act which provides potential relief that includes not only refunding of the deposit(s) but also attorneys fees and treble damages if successfully proven.  Please note that each matter is handled on a case-by-case basis with their own unique facts and parties so outcomes may vary. Additionally the circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 virus and the States response to same are subject to change daily and therefore this article is meant for educational purposes and to advise of your right to legal recourse.  If you and your family find yourself in this situation please do not hesitate to contact me immediately as the ability to recover deposit monies may be extremely time sensitive.  mshaw@bazzurrolaw.com (732) 410-5350",political,Facebook
"CORPORATE RESPONSIBILTY TO THE PUBLIC GOOD My philosophy as a lifelong Green Independent is that impeccable environmental stewardship is directly connected to the strength of our economy and health of our people. Our government should reflect the will of the people and design policies of economic growth that realizes private profit as a means to contribute toward the public good through fair taxation. When wealthy multinational corporations refuse to pay their fair share toward the common good through equitable taxation and when politicians enable those corporations to avoid fair taxation at the deprivation of public interest our economic and governmental structures fail us. The public can not afford any longer to clean up the environmental messes of industry. Any industry that cannot profit without damaging the environment -- that cannot incorporate environmental integrity into the true costs of doing their business -- is an industry that needs to adapt to keep up with the demands of today's world or close their books and start anew. A business model that requires harm to the environment or people is a failed model. Corporations are not private organizations entitled to the rights to do as they please -- they are granted their existences through public charters. When the public trust is broken a corporation's ""right"" to exist must always be questioned. If we can address climate change and land conservation head-on we can realize economic growth through jobs creation reduced energy costs and environmental tourism. Corporations must realize their duty to join us in this effort instead of fighting against a public interest.",political,Facebook

Hi! My name is Jennifer Mendoza and I am seeking election to the Norwood Board of Education. I became a resident of Norwood about 14 years ago. When my husband and I were deciding on a place to live one of the biggest factors we considered was the school district. Based upon the positive things we heard about Norwood we decided to make this great community our home.  I am entering into my 26th consecutive year as an educator. I started my career as a teacher in the Bronx. After teaching 5th and 6th grade for seven years I made the professional move into the Westchester schools. I have been with my current district for the past 18 years teaching 5th and 6th grades Spanish to 2nd - 6th grade and I helped design as well as implement academic intervention support for math in grades 4 to 6. Currently I am teaching 4th grade math as well as 5th and 6th grade science.  I know first hand the intricacies of a school system. I have sat on both sides of the desk as an educator and as a parent. I have seen the cyclical trends in education over the last two and a half decades. I am knowledgeable on the curriculum standards the demands on teachers and administration and the balance between unions and administration as I was the union representative for the teachers in our building for over a decade. I know that student learning is best achieved when all stakeholders take an active role with the mindset of what is best for our children being the driving force in decision making.  Teamwork compromise active listening and respect are all crucial elements in change. I believe that a positive work climate fiscal responsibility accountability transparency and a robust curriculum are what drives a district to success. It is so very important that all stakeholders have the opportunity to have their voice heard in a respectful environment. We may not always agree on everything but we always can be open to hearing differences of opinions.  With two children in the Norwood Public School my family has had our share of successes and setbacks. After some bumps in the road I have come to realize that it is not enough to simply complain or wish for improvement. One must act. There are so many things Norwood does well yet there is also room to improve. I wish to be a board member who can highlight the areas where we can do better for our children to make sure parents stay informed and to be a strong proponent for all children to achieve success.  As a board member I would be conscientious of the spending of taxpayers money. Again what is best for the children will help dictate how money should be spent. The climate within the school is also an area that must be one of professionalism respect and positivity. It is imperative that all parties feel heard and strive for relationships that help not hurt one another.  I am a team player. I am not afraid to speak up for what is right and bring light to situations that need to change. That said I have the ability to listen and hear differing opinions. It is not about winning a disagreement but finding the compromise that can satisfy all involved. We must acknowledge that in all situations there is no way to make everyone happy. Yet everyone should walk away feeling heard valued and a part of the resolution.  I am an honest to the point person. It is in my nature to want to help -- hence my career choice as an educator. I truly believe that Norwood is made up of amazing people and the strength we have together is undefeatable. Lets work together to do our very best for our children. Please help me to support our community by VOTING to ELECT Jennifer Mendoza for Norwood Board of Education on November 3rd 2020.,political,Facebook
Anne Donnelly for District Attorney  Statement of the Anne Donnelly Calling for Governors Resignation and Prosecution 08-03-21  The Governor must immediately resign based upon the findings contained in the report that the Attorney General of New York State that was released today. It is also my opinion as a career prosecutor that justice requires the Governors prosecution for his actions. The Attorney Generals report reveals a disturbing pattern of sexual harassment and retaliation on the part of the Governor. In addition the alleged forceable touching incident demands a response by prosecutors. As a woman I am acutely aware of the corrosive nature of a hostile work environment. As a former prosecutor I have worked to stop sexual harassment wherever it exists. As Nassaus next District Attorney I will make sure that public officials are held accountable for their actions and I will staunchly protect those who come forward to report a hostile work environment.  ###,political,Facebook

There was lots of confusion Friday as the Governor modified his guidance for re-opening of businesses including schools during this Pandemic. At first it appeared that Orange County had slipped back in a way that would prevent OC schools from opening. Then the Governor's office speculated that OC would be upgraded next Tuesday.  In the meantime the Orange County Health Care Agency (OCHCA) sent out a message later on Friday that school re-opening plans already in progress could remain on course.  It is frustrating to operate in this environment of conflicting guidance but we are doing so. CUSD re-opening plans for now remain unchanged. We have an excellent plan that includes protective measures and thoughtful pacing that will allow us time to open while keeping the community safe.  We should all hope that public behavior over Labor Day does not produce a spike of Coronavirus cases in mid-September. This could jeopardize everyone's plan for re-opening later in the month.,political,Facebook
Hi neighbors. Ive had a couple of people ask for me to explain my position on Special Education in the high schools. I realize this is a deep conversation and one that doesnt have a quick answer. This is an area that is very personal to me. My oldest son went through school with a speech and language disorder and had an Individualized Education Plan (IEP). My youngest son just graduated from Liberty High School having had an active 504 plan for all four years. Neither child had a great experience. My oldest son went between contained classrooms and mainstream with disastrous results. I ended up homeschooling him through the last two years of high school. With my youngest son we had learned to advocate for the services that we knew he was entitled to and made sure they got into his 504 plan. Sometimes these services even showed up in the classroom. I have spoken to many parents who ended up pulling their students out of the high schools and homeschooling like I did with my oldest. Its an issue that deserves some real attention. Although this is not my professional specialty I do have a position as a parent and an educator. My position on special education in the schools is of course as complicated as the topic is. I believe in the I.D.E.A. principles of having the students in the least restrictive environment. This means that the if students can be they would be in the classroom learning along with students who do not need services. There is a problem with this. Sometimes these mainstream teachers are not trained to recognize or support students with diverse educational needs. Often students who have mild learning differences are misidentified as trouble-makers and sent to the office for disrupting the learning environment. Sometimes it means students are in self-contained classrooms with specialized teachers. This would be ideal. However oftentimes contained classrooms are under-resourced and under-staffed. Students need enough teachers and aids to ensure that every child can have one-on-one instruction as is needed to ensure their success. This is an issue of resources. Students and families deserve to have the district support their educational needs no matter what those needs might be. If we were to prioritize the issue of ensuring that special education is excellent just like the rest of the educational program there would be an infusion of resources to support professional development for teachers to learn to differentiate the learning environment in mainstreamed classes (which at the high school level is more classrooms than one would imagine). In addition there needs to be an effort to hire more teachers and aids to support contained classrooms. One trained special education teacher is not enough for one of these classrooms. I realize that I am just scratching the surface here and I certainly dont have all the answers. As a parent I do have questions. When does the Liberty Union High School District start the conversation of expanding the resources necessary to ensure that students with special educational needs get the education that they need to be ready for life after high school? Actually I guess I am really asking two questions. Is this merely a question of resources or it is also a question of equity? I want to thank two of my Facebook neighbors for bringing this question to the forefront and I apologize for taking a couple of days to answer it. As I said before it really hits home for me.

A local parent inquired about what I see as the 'Top 3' Issues as they pertain to our School Board and District. Ill highlight the three areas/issues/goals and list my corresponding ideas here. More to come on these issues and more.  1. Budget and Finances: My main goal here is to minimize tax increases without cutting quality. To avoid significant deficits the OVSD is already on track for a steady tax increase (likely 2-2.5%) over the next several years. It is unrealistic to claim we can drastically cut taxes (after all only 7-10% of our budget is discretionary spending!) and more realistic to attempt to hold this increase at a slow rate through thoughtful budgeting and advocating for reform at the State and Federal level. a. Maintain small class size. We must not compromise the quality of instruction and attention our students receive. b. Understand that we offer our teachers a competitive salary and that this is associated with improved retention and quality. We run the risk of staffing gaps and other difficulties if we attempt to cut salaries thereby also risking additional unintended costs. c. Understand the role of local regulations and state and federal systems on school funding. d. Identify areas for reform at the State and Federal levels. Specifically support school choice while advocating for Charter School Reform in PA. As it stands laws surrounding charter school funding have remained unchanged for over two decades. Address disproportionate cost to public schools (and taxpayers) when a child in the district enrolls in a charter school (particularly a cyber charter school). Currently districts tend to overpay as expenditures are based on the school districts expenses and not what it actually costs to educate that student at the specific charter school. Without reform the growing popularity of charter schools and the current funding arrangement will most certainly drive our taxes up exponentially AND result in devastating cuts to our staffing and resources. Statewide this stands as one of the greatest pressures on public school budgets. e. Seek and encourage supplemental sources of funding including grants.  2. Take care to identify and cultivate the many routes for supporting our youth and preparing students for post-graduation success. Post-graduation plans including but not limited to traditional four-year college education trade/vocational school armed service and entering the work force should be respected and fostered. a. Support programs that stimulate students interests and strengths including the arts student government FFA athletics and other clubs. b. Maintain and grow relationships with community and state colleges. c. Support college credit opportunities such as AP courses and dual enrollment and a schedule that allows for students to purse these options. d. Identify mentors in a range of career paths and initiate valuable mentorship programs and opportunities. e. Foster a district-wide educational environment and attitude that recognizes the unique needs interests and strengths of our student population. f. Expand upon curriculum that incorporates life skills training including money management study skills and drivers ed. g. Forge relationships with community organizations that expand upon students interests. h. Support the guidance department in programs that assist students in identifying career goals building resilience and addressing grief coping and other mental health needs. i. Hire and retain support staff to meet requirements of special education programs and services such as speech OT and psychology. j. Empower teachers to seek and utilize their additional training and expand upon their toolkits to be innovative in their efforts to teach a diverse classroom of children. k. Offer students the necessary technology and internet access to pursue applications and educational endeavors.  3. Add a parents perspective to school board conversations. Use my intimate understanding as a parent of children in the district to forge ahead with practical solutions for new and ongoing issues and recognize the unique needs of all families in our district including single parent Stay-at-Home and working parent households etc. a. Make school board meetings accessible by continuing with live-streaming. Encourage the school to post meetings to the districts YouTube channel. Invite parents who would otherwise miss in-person meetings to take note of and partake in our school board meetings. b. Allow parents sufficient time and resources to make choices for their children. As was the case when little notice was provided to parents of the school switching from all virtual to full-time in person instruction last Fall parents are left to make hurried decisions when they could be better supported in considering their options and better guided to resources. c. Should contact tracing remain a relevant issue in the next school year the district should aim to reduce unfair circumstances to those impacted by contact tracing. More specifically should the school find a significant percentage of students out for contact tracing following major events or holidays they should consider planning for temporary school-wide virtual instruction or other means to guarantee each student has the same opportunities to learn and teachers can offer their full attention to instructing all students.  Thanks for stopping by and checking out my perspective. Add to the conversation here ,political,Facebook
Thank you Downtown West Chester PA for the Candidate for Mayor Spotlight! Visit their page to view the original post or read what was copied and pasted below! If you have any further questions concerning some of these topics please post it in the comments or send a DM.  ____________________________________________________________________  is a second-generation resident of West Chester. She graduated from both and . Lillian went on to run her familys long-successful business in the Borough and opened up a second West Chester business in 2008. She is a community organizer who has served on the  the  and . She intends to bring a renewed sense of collaboration and unity back to West Chester- to champion the town & all its people with her leadership.  1. Do you think our main street/downtown is healthy and successful? If not what would you do to change that? West Chesters main street/downtown is healthy because our community was engaged in supporting our small businesses throughout this pandemic. The vast majority of our businesses have survived because they have done a great job of pivoting their business models to adapt. I intend on working with Rep. Dianne Herrin and to re-designate Gay St. and Chestnut St. so that we can keep Gay St. closed for years to come from Thursdays through Sundays.  2. How would you rate the boroughs support of small businesses? What else can be done to help promote our locally owned small businesses? The BID needs consistent support from the Borough Council. It would benefit the BID and West Chester to increase the BIDs advertising budget to draw more business to our town. Additionally new events need to be created to initiate vibrant exciting and diverse activities to draw people into our town.  3. How do you feel about the transportation options currently available in our city? Do we have enough options? If not what will you do to increase those? We support the railroad as a long-term plan but we need more public transportation routes now including more routes to Exton and Paoli stations. We also need to increase public awareness of available routes and public transportation options so that public transportation is a logical choice for residents and visitors. I will also work in the private and public sector to increase the number of routes. This will also help cut down on car traffic in the borough.  4. One topic that is always of concern to small businesses is parking. Do you think the borough has challenges with parking? How would you mitigate those concerns or change the situation? The parking challenges need to be re-addressed. This is a controversial issue and its a multi-layered issue that needs to be revisited since the COVID-19 pandemic began.  5. If you could change one thing in our zoning code what would it be and why? Encourage new developments to build higher and increase density to promote the landscape referendum as endorsed by the county. Making sure all new and renovated buildings in the Borough are LEED-certified should be a priority.  6. How do you plan to involve small business owners in the decision-making process in our town? I will add a virtual quarterly meeting for Borough Council with business owners to increase communication.  7. If someone came to you with a proposal to build a new piece of public infrastructure in our city (road bridge etc.) how would you evaluate whether that project was worth implementing? West Chester is an old town. Much of its infrastructure is deteriorating in disrepair and needs replacement. Each incident needs to be reviewed on its merit and immediacy.  8. If elected what three steps would you take to put our borough on a firmer financial footing? I would reevaluate and restructure the finances of the parking situation in the borough. I would also like to increase the cost of the extra trash bags provided by the Borough for residents that go over the limit of two cans and make them more accessible. I am also interested in hiring an outside auditor to come in and take a look at our finances to confirm where we are spending money and where we can cut costs.  9. If you received a $1 million grant to use for the borough any way you wanted what would you do with it and why? Two of my wishes are to repave and beautify the town with a specific focus on extending and making Market Street as beautiful as Gay Street and tearing down John OGreen park remediating the land and building a true green space.  10. What would be your expectation and commitment regarding engagement and communication with the BID through its Board and/or members? I will make sure that I am in regular communication with the BID board and members by having regularly scheduled calls and spending time in our local businesses.  11. How might we work together to help optimize the BID as a municipal authority of the Borough such as through grant opportunities strategic planning and goal development initiative prioritization? I would encourage the BID to work toward diversifying their board and members through recruitment so that it is more representative of the retail and restaurant communities. This will help the BID develop more innovative ideas and strategies.  12. How can businesses and the police department work together to help control nuisance issues in the downtown? How can business owners assist the borough in keeping West Chester as a safe environment? We need to implement a system for enforcement of the noise ordinance.  _______________________________________________________________________  #debaptiste4wc #debaptistedelivers #debaptiste4mayor,political,Facebook

The following letter addressed to Portland City Council penned by former Portland Parks Director Zari Santner supported by Forest Park Advocate Catherine Thompson and former City Councilman Mike Lindberg is an important read for all Oregonians and especially those who reside in the Portland and tri-county areas.  If you have interest in supporting these important changes to the language of Shelter to Housing Continuum Recommendations from the Planning and Sustainability Commission suggested in this letter please write to City Council right away. The City Council meeting will take place next Wednesday March 17th.  March 1 2021 Dear Mayor Wheeler and members of the Portland City Council  As parks natural areas & trails supporters we are writing to strongly advocate for an important change in the language of Shelter to Housing Continuum recommendations from the Planning and Sustainability Commission. We recommend the removal of Open Space Zones from consideration for either temporary or permanent houseless shelters EXCEPT for a declaration of emergency by the City Council due to a catastrophic natural disaster.  We appreciate the consideration research and thought that staff and commission members put into the S2HC report and its associated recommendations. The misery and distress that houseless people suffer in our community is a heart-rending consequence of decades of inequality ill-considered policy and economic failures. Houselessness is not new to Portland but has grown rapidly in recent years and seems likely to continue to increase as we deal with the long shadow of this pandemic. We believe the majority of the recommendations will do much to help Portland address our houseless crisis.  Our concern is focused on the recommendation that allows temporary shelters in public Open Space. We recommend that Open Space including developed parks natural areas and trails be removed from consideration for siting of either permanent or temporary shelters. Our rationale is outlined below.  1. Availability of Vacant & Underutilized Land - Because adequate alternatives exist there is no need to site temporary or permanent shelters in the Open Space Zone. A BPS staff report to the PSC makes this abundantly clear: The Buildable Lands Inventory showed us that we have plenty of land to meet the City's housing needs for everybody. The constraint on affordability and shelter facilities is the cost of land and the cost of construction and operations not the amount of available vacant and underutilized land. If we have enough land to house everybody it is logical to assume we can find space for the facilities used to shelter people currently not housed. So no we do not need . . . Open Space to meet that need.  2. Equity and Access - Allowing shelters in public open space removes that space from use for intended park purposes by everyone else. Increasingly Portland residents live in spaces with no yard or outdoor area whatsoever. As our population increases and densifies the role of parks natural areas and trails becomes more and more essential. Looking ahead the need for even more parks and open space will be critical to maintain our regions livability for all. Changing the allowed uses for properties in the Open Space Zone makes it unavailable for its intended use. Over the past twenty years Portland voters have consistently approved tax measures to address inequities in access to parks natural areas and trails most recently approving a new Parks levy in November 2020 in the midst of the pandemic. Obviously access to these special places is important to our citizens. We cannot betray that trust.  3. Physical & Mental Health - Nature is not just a nice thing to have  it is fundamentally important for our health wellbeing and happiness. Study after study has confirmed that regular contact with nature is required for mental health and well-being. When people visit parks and green spaces they benefit from a reduction in anxiety depression and stress. Ensuring that these places are always there for everyone is critical for the health of our entire community. The pandemic has highlighted the immensely important role that parks and natural areas play in a densely populated urban environment. On July 31 2020 a Washington Post article entitled Pandemic underscores how public parks shape public health reported that Traffic to local parks is up dramatically [in the pandemic] as people seek safe outdoor places for recreation. Online searches for terms like trails near me . . . have spiked to unprecedented levels in recent months.  4. Negative Impacts on the Resource - The environmental impacts of outdoor shelter are real and are difficult if not impossible to mitigate. Chapter 33.296 of the Portland City Code allows shortterm and minor deviations from the requirements of the zoning code for uses that are truly temporary in nature will not adversely impact the surrounding area and land uses and which can be terminated and removed immediately. Siting permanent or temporary shelters in the Open Space Zone would be in direct conflict with the intent of this chapter. When protected and well managed urban wildlife habitat makes important and measurable contributions not only to urban wildlife but also to clean air and clean water. Sadly these areas are already under stress. We see around us the negative environmental impacts resulting from unsanctioned camping in open space. It does not take long for the things we value most in our parks natural areas and trails to be destroyed by overuse or inappropriate use. Siting larger sanctioned camps or shelters in parks or natural areas even on a temporary basis is a policy decision that would do irreparable harm.  5. Long Term Character of this Emergency  Unfortunately houselessness is not a temporary problem. In the event of an emergency caused by a natural disaster such as an earthquake there is no question that public open space must be made available for temporary shelters. The humanitarian crisis related to our houseless community certainly qualifies as an emergency but it is an emergency that is ongoing and manmade. It must fall into a separate category. The S2HC report acknowledges this fact in the 15.04 commentary: Portlands housing emergency was first declared in 2015 and has been extended several times. These extensions have highlighted that the need for shelter is not an episodic emergency with a discrete beginning and end but is a continuing crisis. It is understood that the need 2 to provide shelter options for our houseless population will be required long into the foreseeable future. The fact is temporary shelters placed in the Open Space Zone would most likely not be temporary at all.  For the reasons outlined above we believe there is no compelling rationale to support inclusion of Open Space for siting temporary or permanent shelters. The long-term impacts would be severe and the resources and time required for restoration would be extraordinary. Portland can and must do better than surrendering its parks natural areas and trails to any use temporary or permanent that jeopardizes their primary purpose - now and into the future.  In making this recommendation we are not saying that parks have no role to play in helping to address the houseless crisis. On the contrary Parks are already making a significant contribution. PP&Rs restrooms are available to all park users at 70 parks throughout the city and during the pandemic the bureau has nearly doubled that amount in order to ensure access to hygiene. In partnership with five different school districts PP&R hosts a free lunch program in the summer  complementing the program offered through the schools during the school year. Finally Parks has always opened community centers in response to extreme weather conditions or other short-term emergencies such as Covid-19 and we support such temporary uses in these facilities.  With their talented team of parks and recreation professionals we know there are myriads of other creative ways that PP&R can support the S2HC effort. However siting shelters in public open space should not be one of them.  We would welcome the opportunity to meet with you to discuss this issue further. We also plan to submit testimony at the March 17 hearing.  Proposed Amendments to the S2HC Recommendations 1. Amend language in 33.296.030.G to remove the Open Space Zone from consideration as either temporary or permanent houseless shelters EXCEPT for a declaration of emergency by the City Council due to a catastrophic natural disaster such as an earthquake 2. Amend language in the new provision 33.296.030.H to add an exception for the Open Space Zone.,political,Facebook
"LET THE BIBLE SPEAK We are greatly concerned in our society with air pollution water pollution and the destruction of the earth by reckless disregard of the environment. While these are legitimate concerns it may be that we are overlooking the elephant in the room. Our biggest problems facing us today are moral corruption and the problem with sin. Sin has always been mans biggest problem. It was sin that separated the first man and woman from the utopia in which God had placed them. Adam and Eve enjoyed a pristine world untainted by the corrupting influence of sin. God has always given man the power of choice. Unfortunately the first couple made a wrong choice by eating of the forbidden fruit. God had warned them: ""Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat; but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die"" Gen 2:17. The word death in the Bible means separation. The first couple sinned by listening to Satan and eating from the one tree of which they were forbidden to partake. Sin made its advent into the world; and death as a consequence of sin. They were driven from the garden and lost their close fellowship with God. Men and women are yet listening to the lies of Satan and disobeying God. Sin continues to separate us from fellowship with God. In the days of Noah sin brought about the destruction of the world by the flood. We read the following in the Genesis account: The earth also was corrupt before God and the earth was filled with violence. So God looked upon the earth and indeed it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted their way on the earth. And God said to Noah The end of all flesh has come before Me for the earth is filled with violence through them; and behold I will destroy them with the earth Gen. 6:11-13. The great flood ensued after God had warned Noah and his family about the impending doom of the world. Noah built the ark according to Gods instructions and he and his family were saved while the rest of the corrupt world perished in the flood. Noah preached to his generation warning them about the coming flood but they would not listen. Unfortunately most are not listening today. Paul wrote that the church exists .in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation among whom ye shine as lights in the world; Holding forth the word of life Phil. 2:15-16. Let us be warned that our greatest threats are sin and moral corruption.

Politically the Markey Kennedy primary is a most interesting contest. I have run several informal polls - mostly on progressive sites which all show a strong preference for Markey. Now the Daily Kos endorses him. Its clear that the more progressive wing of the Democratic Party favor and will be voting for Markey over Kennedy in the democratic primary.  Nowadays in the Republican Party the winners in the primaries are the more right wing candidates. The interesting question here is will the more progressive candidate win in this Massachusetts Senate primary race? No matter who wins what the result says about the Democratic Party in Massachusetts is a very interesting question.  Of course the name Kennedy may be making a disportioncate difference here. That in itself is fascinating as decades have passed since the 60s and the days of President Kennedy and Robert Kennedy. Will new generations with all that has happened and that which exists in modern society respond enthusiastically enough to vote  for a Kennedy on the basis of name largely alone? And against a long proven established Senator preferred by young progressives like AOC and the Sunrise movement?  Something in my gut has all along made me queasy about voting against Markey in this context. I love the Kennedys and what they have done for our party and country and I wish Joe Kennedy III would take up their mantle and fight loudly and with moral conviction against injustices like racism inequality gun violence and the desecration of our environment - like Robert Kennedy did. Then run for Senator or Governor and I would be first in line for him.  Kevin McCarthy 7.20.20,political,Facebook
My thought for the day -  Character is what you do when no one is watching.  This is a very important part of my life.  I'm not really sure what the balance is between remaining humble yet getting in the public eye enough to get noticed. I do know and strongly believe that when God gives you a gift you should share it. People close to me know that is how I live my life.  I do want people to know how much I care for Newton. I do not consider myself a politician - I have no aspirations of moving on to any higher office. My passion is for serving the citizens of Newton-Doing the best job that I can.  Please know this - My business life requires me to work everyday in my office. My schedule is flexible enough I can do other things during the working day. But because of all of the things I am involved in I do not have the flexibility to spend time campaigning.  If I don't knock on your door - it doesn't mean I don't care. It's just that I can't feel good about giving up my benevolent service just to get votes. Doing good for the community is more important than telling you what you want to hear just to get your vote. Only politicians do that - being a Commissioner should be about neighbors serving neighbors.  But I am always available for questions or comments. My goal is to make Newton better for everyone. I will do my best to give Newton residents better amenities without raising the mill levy while creating a better environment for business to grow and prosper. I very much understand this process and know that we are heading in a very good direction. I hope you will let me continue to serve you in the future.,political,Facebook

A Little About Myself  I have been a Volusia County resident since 1978. I come from Detroit Michigan where I completed my education in the area school systems. I then attended Michigan State University majoring in dairy farm management. I came to Daytona beach after finishing college to run the newly acquired family business: the Double D Mobile Ranch.  The Double D Mobile Ranch was a small self-contained community of 56 home sites started in 1969. My parents sister and I were the 5th owner of the property in that 9 year span. The community was self contained in that it had its own drinking water and wastewater plants governed by the Florida Department of Environment and the Florida Department of Health (which was eventually assumed by the Volusia County Department of Health). Our lot rents included water sewage and garbage pick-up. When basic cable television became available we offered it to our residents at cost $9.45. Our site rents were the lowest in the Daytona Beach area. I maintained the equipment premises the rental mobile homes as well as collected the trash. We offered an affordable lifestyle in a rural setting.  The family of my bride was in the restaurant business. I worked most weekend nights during our courtship and beyond even when the little tykes started popping out. i eventually worked in each of their five county wide locations prepping food and cooking. My wife and I along with our 4 children acquired our own restaurant in 2007 in Edgewater which is still functioning even with this corona virus wrecking havoc.  My bride was a local girl and we had 4 children who are all now productive members of society with children of their own. All four graduated from Spruce Creek High School and attended 2 years at Daytona State College. They all four qualified for bright futures scholarships. 3 went on to University of Florida and the forth went to flight school. They all worked in our restaurant while in school and all but one went on into other fields. My one daughter is a civil engineer the other is a registered nurse. My oldest son is managing the family businesses: J.C.'s Riptides restaurant in Edgewater and Robin's Sauces and Dressings in Port Orange. My second son is protecting the nation's power grid by trimming back the encroaching trees from the power lines from a helicopter. I am now an empty nester....even my wife set me free after 29 years of marriage. I still have contact with my offspring and (soon to be) 9 grandchildren. I think my ex fell off the edge of the earth.  J.C.'s Riptides is a steak and seafood restaurant. The J.C. was incorporated in the name in honor of the brides's father John (Jack) Weir whose concept we followed great food at a fair price. Robin's Sauces and Dressings is a business we acquired where we make salad dressings for wholesale to area restaurants. Naturally these dressings are served in all of the greater family's restaurants.  My interest in agriculture culminated in the purchase of a chicken farm in Samsula. Prior to this purchase our small homestead allowed our children to explore the raising of various critters; from calves to chickens and goats. The chicken farm housed 40000 layers and 30000 chicks. I had 5 employees to collect the eggs and maintain the equipment. We took in day old chicks and raised them to approximately 16 - 18 weeks of age. The layers at peak production produced 100 cases of eggs per day 36000 eggs. On weekends and holidays our children had the opportunity to to help gather eggs they were very delighted. This went on for 5 years until the contractor sold out to a larger firm that wanted my contractors 2-one million bird complexes and his market share. This transaction killed all the remaining chicken farms in the area. The major lesson I learned was not to get involved with a business that had just one customer. I considered going independent but the logistics of marketing that quantity of eggs was unfathomable. I raised 20 to 30 head of cattle on the acreage as a side line which I discontinued a number of years ago. I have a desire and know that one day I will again get a few head.  After the devastating divorce I met a woman a few years later now my fiance who suggested I become a respiratory therapist. I took a microbiology and anatomy class at Valencia College to complete required prerequisites for the program. I already had the remainder of prerequisites under my belt from the dairy farm management program. With the extra time I took on a job at Disney World which is in close proximity to Valencia College driving a bus. I didn't make the cut into the respiratory program and then worked to get my teaching certificate. Teaching has better pay and better working hours than driving bus at the wee hours of the morning. I had already been substitute teaching since 2008 in Volusia County. We had opened our restaurant in 2007 just before the real estate bust and subsequent recession/depression. The need for extra income was satisfied by being able to substitute teach: flexible days and daytime hours allowing me to be free to work at night in the restaurant. I have been a substitute teacher in between full time algebra and geometry teaching assignments. I am currently taking classes to complete requirements for the 5 year teaching certificate. Hopefully in the fall I will be able to fill an open teaching position unless I get elected to represent the people of District 3 in Volusia County. Who knows I may do both.  I apologize for the length of this short biography but I hope that you agree I do have a very diverse background.                  .,political,Facebook
This evening I was invited to speak to the East Windsor Education Association board regarding my candidacy for a seat on the school board. Below are the pre-interview questions and answers that I provided.  1. What do you see as your role as a member of our Board of Education?  I believe that the role of a board member is to listen to members of the community and to the teachers to understand the needs of the district and to facilitate change to make the educational environment the best safest and most inclusive space it can be based on the specific needs of the people in that environment every day.  2. What is an area you see as needing improvement in our district? How would you personally work to make that happen?  The environment were in today couldnt have been predicted last year - we are in uncharted territory and our students and teachers are facing challenges none of us could have foreseen. In normal times I would advocate for a well-funded school system with resources for STEM technology education emotional health support and access to best-in-class tools and spaces to support those. With the new environment we find ourselves in I believe its even more critical to find solutions and support for those things. And by working to build the school environment we need to beat COVID we will build a foundation that will help take the district into the future.  3. What would you to do ensure a positive working relationship with the educators of the district?  My role would be as an advocate and a partner. The board should support the community it represents and to do so you need to know the struggles of the people impacted by decisions you make. If it is my responsibility to work on things that impact students and teachers then I care about hearing from them.  4. Why should we support you for a seat on the EWRSD Board of Education?  As a parent to two children in the district today and seeing how they are navigating these new environments and tools it is incredibly important to me to participate when the opportunity is open. I feel that with the current challenges we all face my specific skill set as an operations manager and communications person will suit me well in helping the board to facilitate the changes needed to bring our district through COVID and beyond.,political,Facebook
"Hello Friends of Stylish Living. I have not posted anything about the proposed Downtown Plan because I hoped the discussions Tom and I had with town officials and the discussions other business owners had with same would prevent them from moving forward with the portion that will greatly affect businesses on N Salem Street between Chatham and Saunders St. (from Anna's & The Peak on Salem). I cannot be silent about this any longer as the town council voted last night to move forward with REMOVING 20 of the 30 on-street parking spaces in order to widen the sidewalks for more outdoor dining. Additionally behind the buildings where employees park trash & recycling trucks traverse fire trucks return to their station semi-trucks drive in to make deliveries maintenance vehicles park to provide services etc. those areas are being wiped out in order to make public gathering spaces. We already see with the park-to-dine program that outdoor tables are not used a large portion of the day due to weather issues or restaurants not serving lunch or dinner at different times of the day or week while businesses are open and need those spaces for their customers. Certain officials repeatedly cite ""overwhelming support"" and high percentage support for their plan but as can be read in their published manual about the plan which can be found on the Town of Apex website that support equates in numbers to .029% of the population. That is a miniscule number to cause disruption to the charming authentic historic and vibrant downtown that won Apex the Best Place to Live award in 2015 and continues to bring in new residents/taxpayers from all over the country (and world). I spoke at the Special Session of the Town Council last night and will include my presentation below. The many customers that I have spoken with about this plan have reacted with dismay at why they would want to remove the on-street parking. The retailers and business owners who oppose this portion of the plan are rightly concerned that the only businesses who will survive this will be bars and restaurants. Council members who clearly stated that they were concerned about the needs of the businesses and wanted more parking were essentially overpowered by the words and voice volume of Brett Gantt and Terry Mahaffey who obviously wanted to get this done while they are still in office despite the desires of the REAL majority and the customers of the businesses who have invested hundreds of thousands of dollars into our downtown and countless community-wide fundraisers schools medical causes and more. What incensed me the most is Brett Gantt's smug comment last night: ""I think the comments about this being a bar and restaurant district are going to be a REALITY"" and ""it will inevitable happen."" Yes Mister Beers With Brett IT WILL HAPPEN if you stay in office and continue to get your feedback from people just like you. We will no longer be there to supply countless families with a safe clean family environment. I find it a bit ironic that he is a statistician by profession but he believes that .029% of the population equates to overwhelming support. FRIENDS OF STYLISH LIVING I KNOW YOU AND I DON'T BELIEVE YOU WANT DOWNTOWN APEX TO BECOME A BAR AND RESTAURANT ""ENTERTAINMENT"" DISTRICT AND THIS IS NOT WHY YOU ARE IN APEX. PLEASE SEND A MESSAGE TO THE MAYOR AND TOWN COUNCIL TO LET THEM KNOW YOU WILL NOT STAND FOR THIS.  *****Here is the speech I gave last night***** I AM LINDA LAND OWNER OF STYLISH LIVING  MY HUSBAND AND I MET INDIVIDUALLY WITH YOU IN MAY AND HAVE SPOKEN WITH THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT MEMBERS AND STANTEC CONSULTANTS.  WE EXPRESSED OUR OPPOSITION TO THE PORTION OF THE PLAN THAT ELIMINATES ON-STREET PARKING BETWEEN CHATHAM AND SAUNDERS AS WELL AS CHANGING THE AREAS BETWEEN SEABOARD STREET AND THE BUSINESSES FROM A BUSINESS OPERATIONS SPACE TO A PUBLIC GATHERING SPACE.  I HAVE COME TO VIEW THIS AS A COURT CASE WITH THE TOWN COUNCIL MEMBERS AS THE JURY. YOU WILL MAKE A DETERMINATION OF WHICH VIEWPOINT HOLDS THE BEST EVIDENCE.  THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT HAS PRESENTED THEIR CASE:  THERE WAS COMMUNITY OUTREACH WHICH PRODUCED 135 PEOPLE AT THE FIRST OPEN HOUSE AND 143 PEOPLE AT THE FINAL PRESENTATION I WOULD GUESS MANY OF THE SAME PEOPLE ATTENDED BOTH MEETINGS. THERE WERE 1768 RESPONSES TO ONLINE SURVEYS WE KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THE RESPONDENTS OR IF THE TECHNOLOGY BLOCKED DUPLICATES OTHER SELECTIVE SURVEYS WERE DONE: PEOPLE WHO CHOSE TO SIT IN THE EXPERIMENTAL PARKLET WERE SURVEYED ABOUT THE PARKLET PEOPLE WHO WERE PATRONIZING A BREWERY WERE ASKED ABOUT DOWNTOWN AND THEY SAID IT NEEDED A BREWERY THERE WERE NO SURVEYS DONE OF CUSTOMERS WALKING TO THEIR CARS I AM GUESSING THERE WERE NO SURVEYS DONE OF PEOPLE IN THE CARPOOL LANES AT LOCAL SCHOOLS TO GET THE VIEWPOINT OF BUSY PARENTS  THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT IS MAKING A RECOMMENDATION TO KEEP 10 OUT OF 30 PARKING SPACES AT MOST AND TO PROCEED WITH THE SEABOARD AND COMMERCE STREET PROJECTS.  REGARDLESS OF THEIR RECOMMENDATION THEY WILL KEEP THEIR JOBS.  THE OPPOSITION BEING SEVERAL RETAILERS AND BUSINESS OWNERS IN THE AFFECTED AREA HAVE PRESENTED THEIR CASE.  THE TOWN HAS A POPULATION OF ABOUT 70000 EVEN IF THE MEETING ATTENDEES AND ONLINE SURVEY RESPONDENTS WERE DIFFERENT PEOPLE THAT IS JUST .029% OF THE POPULATION WE ASKED FOR SOMEONE TO GIVE US ONE EXAMPLE OF A PLACE SIMILAR TO APEX WHERE THIS HAS BEEN DONE AND IT IS A SUCCESS. NOBODY HAS BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE ONE NOT EVEN STANTEC WHO HAS OFFICES IN 41 STATES THERE ARE AN AVERAGE OF 34 DAYS PER YEAR WITH TEMPERATURES OVER 90 DEGREES AND 90 DAYS PER YEAR WITH HIGH TEMPERATURES UNDER 60 DEGREES THAT IS AN AVERAGE OF 124 DAYS THAT IT IS NOT CONDUCIVE TO EATING OUTSIDE BASED ON TEMPERATURES ALONE THERE ARE 107 RAINY DAYS ON AVERAGE PER YEAR IT IS DARK AT DINNERTIME FROM NOVEMBER TO MARCH NOT ALL RESTAURANTS IN THE AFFECTED AREA SERVE BOTH LUNCH AND DINNER AND NOT ALL ARE OPEN 7 DAYS PER WEEK WE ARE OPEN EVERYDAY OR 64 HOURS PER WEEK WE PROVIDED EVIDENCE OF WHAT HAPPENED TO MANY PLACES WHEN PARKING WAS REMOVED FROM STOREFRONTS WE PROVIDED EVIDENCE THAT PARKED CARS ARE A TRAFFIC CALMING FACTOR AND A SAFETY FACTOR BETWEEN PEOPLE ON THE SIDEWALK AND MOVING THROUGH TRAFFIC. WE HAVE ASKED OUR CUSTOMERS AND THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY PARKING WOULD BE REMOVED.  IF PARKING IS REMOVED THERE IS GOOD PROBABILITY BASED ON FACTUAL INFORMATION THAT OUR BUSINESS WILL SUFFER IF NOT CLOSE.  TOWN COUNCIL PLEASE DONT EXPERIMENT WITH OUR BUSINESSES AND OUR CHARMING AUTHENTIC AND VIBRANT DOWNTOWN IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE THE WISHES OF .029% OF THE POPULATION WHO LIKELY DONT HAVE BUSINESS EXPERIENCE.

But actually I could have used any nation and any flag to represent the title statement short and sweet. But in reality it is a meaningless phrase it does not represent the reality of humanity.

Our leaders laud the unity of the country when in reality they can barely talk to each other can not get along and holding back the country fro the true progress needed to advance the country.

First of all it is difficult to have an open discussion and exchange of ideas in a nation where so much information is kept under wraps for reasons of ""state security"". We have no idea what our government is doing on our behalf and in our names.  Worse what we call an open and free media is all owned by big corporations and billionaires do you really think they are looking out for your interests over their owner's?  The media create ideas implant ideas in your head and nurture these encouraging you to believe no one else but them your favorite channel of course. So if CNN or MSNBC make you depressed or disgusted you can turn to FOX any channel any show and soon you are raging homicidal suicidal maniac no depression here.  Media are used to separate the populous to divide the country and to reinforce negative feelings towards each other. Any idea that will separate one from the other will do. And while the people fight each other are ready to harm each other the thieves are looting the country blind don't you wish the Russians had it this easy?

EMERGENCY CHANGE OF CUSTODY  What if an emergency situation occurs and I need the Jackson County Circuit Court to grant me sole custody of the kids?  Sometimes a situation occurs while the children are under the care of the other parent that is so extreme that you need the Jackson Circuit Court to grant you emergency sole custody of the kids. This generally occurs when there is some type of abuse whether it is sexual physical or even verbal abuse. Otherwise it would have to be some circumstance that poses a serious danger to the childrens safety. Usually Child Protective Services will be called so they can conduct an investigation.  In Michigan Section 722.23 of the Child Custody Act defines the best interests of the children as the sum total of the following factors:  a. The love affection and other emotional ties existing between the parties involved and the child.  b. The capacity and disposition of the parties involved to give the child love affection and guidance and continuation of the educating and raising of the child in its religion or creed if any.  c. The capacity and disposition of the parties involved to provide the child with food clothing medical care or other remedial care recognized and permitted under the laws of this State and other material needs.  d. The length of time the child has lived in a stable satisfactory environment and the desirability of maintaining continuity.  e. The permanence as a family unit of the existing or proposed custodial home or homes.  f. The moral fitness and mental/physical health of the parties.  g. The home school and community record of the child.  h. The reasonable preference of the child if the Court deems the child to be of sufficient age to express preference.  i. The willingness and ability of each of the parents to facilitate and encourage a close and continuing parent-child relationship between the child and the other parent.  j. Domestic violence regardless of whether the violence was directed against or witnessed by the child.  k. Any other factor considered by the Court to be relevant. MCL 722.23 (emphasis added)  It is well-settled that relevant factors need not be given equal weight; the weight to be given any factor is ultimately left to the Jackson Circuit Court Judge's discretion. Riemer v Johnson 311 Mich App 632 876 NW2d 279 (2015). You have to show the court that it is in the best interests of the minor children to immediately remain in your sole care and custody and to temporarily suspend the other parents custody and parenting time. Usually the court will hold a hearing within a week and will want to hear from the assigned case worker from Child Protective Services.  Pursuant to MCR 3.607(B) Pending the entry of a temporary order the court may enter an ex parte order if the court is satisfied by specific facts set forth in an affidavit or verified pleading that irreparable injury loss or damage will result from the delay required to effect notice or that notice itself will precipitate adverse action before an order can be issued.  You will have to show the presiding Jackson Circuit Court Judge that given the circumstances as outlined above an Emergency Ex Parte Order suspending the other parents parenting time is appropriate until the Court can hold a hearing under MCR 3.607(C) regarding whether entry of a Temporary Order suspending the other parents parenting time is appropriate.,political,Facebook
I am Evan Brown and I am seeking re-election to the Red Wing City Council. It has been a privilege to serve the residents of Wards 3 & 4 the past four years.  I have worked for a sustainable Red Wing: economically socially and environmentally sustainable for all residents and future generations. I have worked to build on those core values delivering for our city housing social justice business development and environmental stewardship.  I have listened and learned from residents and helped bring their voices to the table. I believe that governance is really about the marketplace of ideas and the ideas of residents are paramount in my decision making process.  I have long believed and delivered on the idea that we can do right by the environment and save money. Before being elected I advocated for the city subscription to a solar garden. That will save the city $6 million over 25 years. I continue to look at other environmental opportunities that can reduce our costs such as electric vehicles with no emissions and very little maintenance that cost less over the life of the vehicle.  This council has done more for affordable housing than any other council in the past 2 decades. I am proud of my work for more senior housing and more downtown housing to give people more options. I have advocated for affordable housing for our residents and will continue to do so.  Red Wing is a destination and attracting new visitors to our city benefits us all. Being a destination helps build our local businesses and brings dollars into our community. Our investment in Levee park will allow us to host 2 riverboats at a time with a potential third at the Baypoint park bulkhead. With 3 riverboat companies coming to Red Wing we will see an average of a boat a day during the season. That means many visitors walking shopping and enjoying our community who take their experiences back with them to tell others. This is an example of how we invest in our community for future economic growth.  2020 has been an unprecedented year. From the impacts of the pandemic to the calls for social justice our residents have had to struggle with so much. They have looked for assistance and I have heard them. I listened as they described the struggles of managing their small businesses through the pandemic and got to work.  As a member of the Port Authority Finance committee I was at the forefront of developing an emergency small business loan program. I was the first to call on Port Authority staff to detail a program to get those funds out into our small business community. I advocated for those funds being forgivable and/or zero interest loans. All told the Port Authority in 3 COVID-19 loan programs has allocated nearly $1 million to our small business community with over $750000 of those dollars already being delivered. With assistance from the city side for businesses and residents we have put over $1.3 million into our community to help through this trying time. And we continue to look to deploy more assistance through the CARES money the city has been allocated. I am working on budget cuts that will reduce the tax burden on everyone.  I have and continue to be an advocate for justice and equity. In my support of the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women my advocacy against the horrific Zero Tolerance Policy to the development of the our Advisory Team on Government Policies I have worked to make Red Wing a community where all feel welcome. With that advisory team I hear the critical need to have a dialogue about these challenging issues of equity and justice in our community.  I fully support our law enforcement professionals and know with this conversation our community can reach higher by the very act of listening and working together. Every member of our community should feel safe in their home.  I have always said Red Wing is a city that punched above its weight. We are scrappy innovative and we seem to be ahead of the curve in addressing the issues that face all of us. I believe in that spirit. We have challenges facing us no doubt. We have a lot of building to do. I look forward to helping build that future. I ask for your vote for Evan Brown for wards 3 & 4 on November 3rd.,political,Facebook
Howdy. Just over a week until the election.  Below is a copy of the Breeze-Couriers article on todays (Sunday) paper. The paper requested candidates submit articles.  RICK BRYAN  I was born raised and attended school in Taylorville. I am married and my daughters presently attending Memorial School and Taylorville High School. I graduated Lincoln Land with a degree in Law Enforcement Administration. My experience on the school board began in 2013 when I was elected to serve on the board until 2017. In 2019 I was selected from a pool of highly qualified candidates to fill a vacancy on the board which I presently serve on. Ive served on finance athletic building and public relations committees. Presently I chair the Athletic committee. I am retired from the Taylorville Police Department serving as an Officer Sergeant and Detective. As a Juvenile Officer I frequently worked with disadvantaged and troubled youth. I taught DARE in the Taylorville Schools and served on several school advisory boards from the Even Start program for Pre-K students to student cell phone usage at the high school. My coaching experience includes youth baseball and softball. All kids have a place in my heart and I want to see every child succeed.  2013 through 2017 was some of the most financially challenging times in the district. The state was prorating our general state aid at 10%. Meaning you would make a budget for the year and the state would not pay 10% of the amount they promised the schools. Categorical payments (bussing special education) would be late and the state would routinely not pay 1 of the 4 payments promised to our students. With the generous help of our community we were able to pass a sales and property tax to fund our schools. I cant say enough how the community pulled together to make that happen. That was critical to us being able to offer the programs we are known for. Through difficult and prudent decisions we were able to avoid drastic cuts to programs and get into a stable financial position. When Covid hit we made substantial cuts to the budget.  We just completed refinancing our bonds saving the district hundreds of thousands of dollars by securing a lower interest rate. We moved the administrative offices from a leased building to unused space at the high school saving the district $30000 a year.  Since I was board member we added classrooms and the gym at North School. Memorial and Central schools were renovated and roofs repaired. We added a Daikin heating and A/C system. One of the advantages of the Daikin system was moving fresh air continuously through the classrooms. This reduced the number of absences due to illness and makes a healthier classroom. The high school west gym had structural repairs completed. Vocational programs were expanded and we developed a relationship with the Capital Area Career Cener to prepare students who were looking for vocational careers. We increased Advanced Placement (AP) classes so high school students can receive college credit at the same time they are taking classes here. We upgraded internet speeds and reliability at the schools. We purchased chrome books for every student. Through our community partners wi-fi hotspots were given to students without internet access. This was invaluable during the pandemic to keep students connected to school. We installed cameras at the schools and added School Resource Officers (SROs). Breakfast and Lunch programs were expanded.  Social Emotional Learning is the backbone of our curriculum. Students are better able to learn when their social/emotional needs are meant. To accomplish this we added social/emotional counselors to help our students succeed. This helps all students and is particularly helpful with K-2 students. This allows our guidance counselors to focus on helping students make academic choices that are best for them. A new mentoring program is in force. Students can receive one on one mentoring from teachers principals and administrators. Our staff is working feverishly catching up students that have been remote for a year.  Our Agricultural program is one of if not the best in the country. We just voted to have them farm the 40 acres north of the high school making for less travel time. Journalism is nationally recognized and our music program has been exceptional for decades producing professional musicians and educators again and again. Our building trades program is back and was featured on HGTV. These programs promote our community which I want to continue to expand. Our teachers make these programs successful and we have some the best anywhere.  In 2019 a vision was created. A complete audio/visual studio streaming live events completely ran by students. Today that has come to fruition. TommyTV started as a club and made into a class in only one year. Youve probably seen it on YouTube and Facebook live. There is a professional studio complete with a green screen. Students are teaching students and they are getting skills in high school that directly relate to careers in media right out of school. Additional offerings of related vocational classes will be offered. No district in the area has anything like TommyTV. The program has just started and already professional quality content is created several times a week. The best part is its self funded. This will grow quickly into a highly recognized program.  Like so many others Im excited we are back in the classrooms! I support the health and safety of students and staff. The sacrifices made by parents students and teachers have been rough but we are back in person.  The finances over the next 2 years will be challenging. The state is talking about proration again. State government is saying 5% to 10% reduction in payments the next two years. This is worrisome when you add declining sales tax minimal new construction revenue to capture and more unfunded mandates from the legislature. Categorical payments may be late or missing. That being said I believe we are the only board in Christian County operating in the black. We have been very conservative in our spending including delaying some projects until we have a better picture of our financial future. I take my fiduciary responsibility to the tax payers seriously. Our buildings are older and maintenance is an ongoing challenge. The most important thing is that we are ready to educate students in a healthy and safe environment which meets their needs.  The community wants a fine arts center. Its been discussed for over 20 years. There is a committee being formed to see how we get there and how that might look. We will need to work together to make this happen. Taylorville has always supported the schools and I will support those efforts. Projects like this help promote our community and pay back over time. Students watch a production and it encourages them to find their love of the arts. We have needed a modern venue with increased seating for many years.  Vocational programs need to expand even more. Many of our students are going into the workforce and we must give them tools to succeed. Our partnership with CACC is wonderful. In addition we need to have more of our own programs. This needs to be a priority as it serves a lot of students.  Technology in the classroom needs upgraded. STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Math) type classrooms should be the norm not the exception. One lab in one room is an outdated model. There are grants for projects like these but with proration being a probability; those opportunities may be less frequent. Should an opportunity come along we are ready to move on it.  Graduation is the highlight of the school year. Its a confirmation to every student that perseverance pays off. Its the work of dozens of dedicated teachers working long hours night after night. Its the work of parents at the dining table helping their kids with homework night after night. Its the student deciding to ask a teacher for help. Its the encouraging word from a coach. This is why were here. I will continue to work to make sure every student succeeds. Id appreciate your vote on April 6.,political,Facebook
The transcript to the video I posted outlying how we have gotten to this point in our journey. For those who would rather read than watch. Thank you for your time   Good evening. I have written and will be reading a statement outlining exactly why I am running in this election. First off I would like to address a few things. My voice my be a bit scratchy but its because I was not feeling well today. I understand when I posted my videos previously that my appearance was not professional. Those videos were released only as an update. I promise you all I recognize the events when I need to act and dress professionally. This is one of those times. I have written out my statement to ensure clarity and continuity so forgive me for not looking at the camera. Unfortunately there is little I can do about the background and lighting as resources are scarce in my attempt to run for this office. But I hope ultimately my words and messages will be what is focused on. Now here is a prepared statement written by me and I take full responsibility for all information that I am about to relay.  For a long time I have questioned the leadership here in El Paso. I dont feel I am alone in this from speaking with friends co-workers customers at my work. It seems no matter who is sitting in the chairs of authority that they continuously make decisions that just dont make any sense. Mismanaged funds making so many decisions without allowing the public to vote letting voters decide as not following through poor planning as far as development and blatant neglect for many areas in this city. Heres some of the most recent examples. (I will summarize best I can) 1) Chihuahua Stadium being built was decided by the city council and not given to the voters to decide. Now they did allow El Pasoans to vote on a Hotel Tax to help pay for it. The selling point being either you vote yes to the hotel tax or we get bonds that will essentially fall on taxpayers to fund. They were going to do it regardless. So do the right thing. This was a collaboration between city leaders and Paul and Jordan Foster. 2) Zaragoza SportsPark rebuild was decided by the county commissioners. They also voted for renovations to their own building. Did the public get to vote on it? Nope? Not up to them. They know whats best for us. There was a delay in the project being finished. The reason and fault? Well the original contractors will say problems caused by the county. The county will say problems from the original contractors. Either way the original contractors were booted and El Paso County had to decide who was going to be the ones to finish the SportsPark. Any guesses who won that contract? Yep Jordan Foster Construction. Imagine that. 3) Great Wolf Lodge was going to be brought to the Westside of El Paso. This was something that got approved by both City Council and County Commissioners and would offer millions of dollars in tax incentives to Foster. It ultimately was cancelled by Fosters group due to the pandemic. That brings us to 4) County Commissioner David Stout seems to be the only one standing up for the residents and historic preservation of the Duranguito district in downtown. This area is under siege by the city to be destroyed. For what? For an all purpose sports arena downtown. Some of you all may remember that this was proposed deceptively with the ordinance and bond election of 2012. We were told hotel tax was gonna pay for the baseball stadium. That is not the case. Taxpayers picked up the difference and are continuing to pay for it through many of the services necessary for for it to continue running. They lied blatantly. Guess who the developer is? Yeah Paul Foster who is year by year allocating as much of downtown as he can. He is the power player in this city. What he says is what they will do. Plaza hotel? Paul Foster. Blue Flame? Paul Foster. Entertainment districts in downtown? Paul Foster. Now I have never met the man and he may be opposed to much of what I say but I will say Commissioner David Stout seems to be the only man of any integrity in the whole bunch. I bring this up because it is widely believed that Judge Richard Samaniego won the election against John Cook for County Judge because of his stance on preserving heritage and how John Cook was in favor of the demolition in favor of the new arena. Well I ask where is he? He has publicly stated he will not meet with Paul Foster or any of the downtown owners concerning the issue. He has washed his hands of it seemingly because it is of no benefit to him personally. Classy move. I can only go by the optics but it appears he does not wish to ruffle any feathers. He knows that to go against Paul Foster is could be local political death sentence in this city. And he knows that publicly going against what he preached to get elected could be a local political death sentence. So he chooses to avoid the situation all together. If Im wrong Id love for him to explain or for someone to educate me otherwise. If it can be done and has facts to back it up I will rescind my comments on the situation. But I will not apologize because I have another reason not to trust him. And its ultimately what helped me to decide to run for local public office. El Paso was bringing a festival called Freakazoid Robot Festival. The concert was to take place over two days during Labor Day Weekend. The two dates being 09/04/2021 and 09/05/2021. On August 9th 2021 it was announced that the festival had been suspended. The primary reason given was because of safety issues concerning COVID-19. This announcement was released in conjunction with the allowance of a youth baseball tournament. I found it odd that in the interest of safety that one event was suspended and another was scheduled to go along as planned. On Facebook one of the multiple sites that announced the decision it showed that many people who had bought tickets for the event (some also purchased hotels and rental cars)were upset myself included. It made it even more upsetting that a youth baseball tournament was still scheduled compounded by the fact that the city of El Paso had been loudly and publicly trying to fight Governor Abbot over masks mandates for schools. This was after the Texas Supreme Court had already made a decision. I understand that there are jurisdiction issues concerning city and county. However I would like to point out that last year in 2020 Judge Samaniego fought long and hard against both Governor Abbot and then Mayor Dee Margo to overrule any protocols they did or did not put in place as COVID was new and started the beginnings of the current pandemic. He made sure to be public and defiant and actually throw his weight around as County Judge. Challenging Attorney General Ken Paxton as well. He showed them no respect in how he approached the issue. He reminded me of some law enforcement that I had interactions with when I was younger. He wanted to be a bully intimidating and a celebrity as well. This is important because it shows that he is not against getting involved in city issues if he feels necessary. So I decided to begin looking into the situation and digging deeper to see how they came to such a decision. I had contacted the promoter of the festival on Twitter with no response initially. I had accused Judge Samaniego The county Commissioners and El Paso City Council of what I thought to be a bias and discriminatory decision. Now I know under the law it is technically not discrimination because music even as art is not protected under civil rights. But logically you can as a person discriminate against others for such things. With the little to no information I received from all three parties I issued an apology publicly on Twitter to Judge Samaniego the county commissioners and El Paso City Council and made it known that the only information the promoter had given was that he heard an impassioned argument by the Judge and since the show had been suspended he decided to do what the Judge thought best. It seemed he just didnt want a fight and he had other dates scheduled on his tour. Decisions like this can and will effect this cities opportunities to bring back like festivals which generate revenue and have a large following in this city. I then went back to Twitter and offered a public apology to both Judge Samaniego and The City Council for my accusations. I stated that it was the promoter that had made the decision. It was then that the promoter posted two links to two separate sessions of Commissioners Court. These sessions were the ones that discussed both the Youth Baseball Tournament and the Freakazoid Festival. In the interest of fairness and a search for truth I decided to watch both sessions. This is where I started noticing glaring issues. I watched both sessions by Judge Samaniego and the Commissioners speaking and ruling on these two events and noticed differences in the presentation and preparation as far as details for both events. Also the language and tones used were blatantly negative towards the festival and beaming positively towards the tournament. Not to mention a large discrepancy in estimated attendance spoken in the hearings and what was being reported to the public. On the Monday session August 16/2021 when being presented the issue I noticed that all the information was presented in a negative connotation. Speaking of only the things that would be a negative to bring to the city. However when presented with the Youth Baseball Tournament it was presented with positivity and much more detail about how it would be a positive for the city. Which now makes a bit more sense seeing as how past regimes were the ones responsible for allowing Jordan Foster Construction to carry out the finishing of the sportsplex. Judge Samaniego asked if they could think about the issues and decide at the next hearing which was 08/19/2021. Each commissioner agreed. I then viewed the session from 08/19/2021. Once the issue was brought before Judge Samaniego and the commissioners it went to recess almost immediately. The recess was nearly an hour and once they resumed the clerk first stated the issue of the Freakazoid Robot Festival. Judge Samaniego asked the District County Attorney if they needed an action. Attorney Erica Rosales-Kinney (the name was hard to understand but I believe that to be her) then spoke to the Judge and Commissioners on behalf of The District Attorney and said no action was needed but she was only there to provide direction to staff. Then with no discussion Judge Samaniego immediately accepts recommendation of Director of Health Dr. Hector Ocaranza to suspend the festival. Nothing more is said in regards to the festival. Then they move forward and are presented the Youth Baseball tournament. Judge Samaniego then goes on again to praise with trust and confidence that the tournament will be held with a safe environment and all precautionary measures. Going so far as to mention that there will be children under the age of 12 participating but he has no concerns. Then the clerk speaks on how the tournament will be outdoors and there will be no more than 2500 spectators outdoors. The Judge accepts again this recommendation by Dr. Hector Ocaranza to hold the tournament and the session concludes. I found this entire session concerning these two events blatantly bias and discriminatory. I knew that my perception alone would not do much so I decided to continue to research this decision the best I could with very little at my disposal. It was then that I met contacted on Twitter by another who was interested in the research I was doing. I will not divulge his identity until I have his approval. He contacted me on one of my posts I had written explaining the information I had received to some of the people who were upset with the festival being canceled. From that point on This fellow concerned citizen and myself worked close with each other to find any information we could to make this decision make sense. After watching the sessions we decided to research the issue for 2 main reasons. 1) to show that it isnt solely about the festival but what I believe is the Judge and Commissioners ruling with discrimination and bias. And 2) to attempt to find more information that support my claims. The easiest and initial information we searched and reviewed was a news report from ABC News affiliate channel 7 KVIA. In this report they cite information that was not presented in the meetings. First they say that Dr. Hector Ocaranza decided against the Festival because of the close contact expected. The report then goes on to state that they were told that they were expecting a very large crowd. Here is where I became even more suspicious. The news report states that they were told that the attendance concern was an estimated 19000 people each day. However when I reviewed the session the attendance number given to Judge Samaniego and the commissioners was 15000. It was not specified in the session whether that was each day or a total for both days. Either way this equals out to a difference of 4000 or 8000. Its unclear because none of those numbers nor the specifics of each day or total was presented to Judge Samaniego and the commissioners. I do not know how or where the number came to be but I assure you it was not stated in the session and is greatly inflated compared to the 15000 that was expressed in the session. The report also interviewed a couple of El Paso business owners that were upset about the revenue that the city was going to lose as a whole amongst other concerns. Thats about all that is of importance in the news report. With this information the fellow concerned citizen was able to contact with someone who had knowledge of the situation that again I will not mention unless I receive their approval to do so. I assure you though the state of Texas is aware of all that I am telling you and has the names of these parties. The one who had knowledge of the situation was able to inform us that Judge Samaniego and the commissioners were concerned about visitors coming in from out of town and was another reason for suspending the Festival. With this information I began researching the youth tournament that was going on as scheduled and scheduled the same weekend that the festival was suspended. It was not easy and took a considerable amount of time to find pertinent information concerning this youth tournament. It was not easy but it was not impossible. I was able to find that of the 137 teams that would be competing in this tournament 20 were definitely from out of town. Alpine/Midland/Odessa Texas as well as Chaparral/Las Cruces NM and others. Many of the teams listed do not have cities of origin listed. They dont have sites that specify or not that I could uncover but I imagine some of them are from outside of El Paso as well. If you decide to investigate further although that information I cannot state it as fact. Also while trying to find information for this tournament I stumbled upon another baseball tournament that is to be held august 27/2021 as well as august 28/2021. In the promotional information flyer it states proudly that there has been interest from 10 states and umpires and other officials would be coming from all over the United States to assist in this tournament. Two tournaments many people from out of state many of them children teams ranging from ages 5 and under to ages 16 and under. I found it to be odd that the city and county are having so many events proudly boasting bringing in people from all over the United States which is sure to attract many fans and parents and workers from out of town all while using those same reasons for what appears to be targeting suspending and ultimately leading to the cancelling of The Freakazoid Robot Festival. It makes absolutely no sense to me. I tried contacting Judge Samaniego through Twitter letting him know that I felt he owes citizens and residents an explanation. I was not polite about it either. I will own that. I was upset at the deception and the lies and my emotion was strong and full of vitriol. I never received any correspondence back from him through multiple attempts. I would also like to add that within this time there were multiples of events happening throughout El Paso and none are being spoken of negatively suspended or cancelled. Again I understand the separation of city and county but Judge Samaniego has shown in previous actions that he has no qualms about getting involved with city issues if he sees fit in what he would say is in the best interest of El Paso. However he does not have any problem with all the events that El Paso is hosting and although I cant swear to it I imagine some would fall into his jurisdiction. He has made no mention. Here are some examples. Along with both separate baseball tournaments Megadeth at the Don Haskins center A Juan Gabriel Tribute Concert Minerpalooza was extremely packed back to back for Coolio Pride March On and on. But the real one was this. The rain had made the road up to McKelligan Canyon undrivable and unsafe. Did they think it may be best to cancel it? No. They actually moved it to the convention center downtown. All of it makes no sense and in the interest of fairness and equality seems terribly bias towards those who wished to attend the Freakazoid Robot Festival. I feel that all of this is relevant and shows that the decision he made on this one singular event shows that he decided with his own personal intentions and preconceived notions as opposed to the safety of the citizens and residents that voted for him to speak for represent and make decisions in the best interest of. I understand that this type of music and the people who enjoy it may not be acceptable to some and may be looked down upon by some but the idea that a County Judge would seemingly also use that same bias against them is wrong. He is supposed to make decisions in FAIRNESS and EQUALITY with the best interest of all El Paso citizens. Not SOME El Paso citizens. I want to thank everyone who decided to watch this. I know it is incredibly long and full of great detail but I hope you see that as a positive. I have tried my best to do my due diligence in collecting information regarding what I believe shows that Judge Samaniego was not being fair or equal in this decision. I have tried contacting news agencies reporters local activists and anyone who may have a platform to get my grievances out to the public. I figured for this to have an impact it was a time sensitive issue. I didnt want it to be forgotten or pushed to the side. It not about the festival as some would think. That was just the catalyst that led me to take the actions I have. And after much thought and deliberation ultimately leading to me decide to run for county Commissioner. To be clear I did not wish for all events to be cancelled. Quite the opposite. I believe that El Paso should have been and should be open and not mandated and events and life should go on as normal with every person making decisions that they believe are best for their families and themselves. I just feel that whatever the decision they made it should have been made with fairness and equality and I believe the decisions of Judge Samaniego The El Paso County Commissioners and El Paso City Council show bias discrimination and selfishness. To allow this to happen without having to answer for such bizarre decisions leaves the door open for other decisions made under the same unfair unequal and bias beliefs of these three parties. Think of it like this. If he was a sitting judge and someone who he didnt understand or identify with came into his courtroom looking for a fair trial do these and many of his other actions lead you to believe he would or could be fair or impartial? This festival may not concern you but next time it could be something that affects you or your family. That is why I am running. I want to take care of areas in Precinct 4 that have been terribly neglected for years and years. And I want all citizens and residents to be treated with respect. I want all of our elected officials to remember that THEY WORK FOR US. THEY HAVE A DUTY AND AN OBLIGATION TO TREAT EACH AMD EVERY PERSON WITH RESPECT. And when they make these blatantly terrible and bias decisions singling out one or two or any group of people that doesnt fit their agenda they still have an obligation to do their job and represent the people who allowed them to be where they are. And Im not only talking about the few who own big land contracts. Im talking about hundreds of thousands who voted them in. You are their bosses. They work for you. Allow me to remind them everyday. That is what I mean when I say I AM RUNNING FOR EQUALITY and INTEGRITY through TRANSPARENCY. Let me work for you and demand accountability. Thank you and goodnight to each and every one of you.,political,Facebook
I have been asked why I want to run again. I am running to be reelected because I want to work more for our district. I have strived tirelessly to bring our board to a state of higher transparency in order to make sure we operate with the feedback of all stakeholders. Now that this board is open to this critical input it is a top priority that we stay involved and engaged. Our policies goals and vision statement need to reflect this. I personally hope to achieve this by making sure that every student; without regard to race religion gender economic status and much more can walk through that door and have an equitable school experience that results in a positive move forward. Equally every staff member needs the same employment opportunity with zero stereotypes or stimas and needs to be supported with all the tools and training needed to do the job. As well as a contract and working environment that motivates each staff member to stay. This means keeping informed and proactive as a board member in order to understand and take action on all the needs within our district. Having spent many years working in the district followed by another 7+ volunteering in our schools I have a very clear understanding of the top needs of our districtand how to get things done. My track record proves that.,political,Facebook
Why do I stress the importance of education?  Education is something we can not inherit from our parents. This is why we treasure and invest heavily in our education system. Children have one opportunity to take advantage of the education our public schools have to offer.  Lets face it - what has transpired over the past two years has derailed our educational aspirations for our children. Our children are learning less and many are likely a full year behind where they would have been without lockdowns and the challenges of remote learning. This will undoubtedly have an impact on our children's future and financial well-being.  As the global economy continues to impact our industries at home we have to continuously evaluate whether the education we are imparting is reflecting the needs of our future workforce.  Life skill classes are an integral step in that direction. These classes include but are not limited to: financial literacy computers culinary arts sewing entrepreneurship and communications. Such courses help children tap into skills that they otherwise might never have had a chance to experience better preparing them for future careers.  I am committed to working with the district to create innovative programs that will instill children with the knowledge and the confidence to navigate today's ever changing competitive environment.  #MahwahSchools #MahwahBoardOfEducation #MahwahBoardOfEd,political,Facebook
I've been posting many of these things individually for the past several weeks but if you still have questions about me please feel free to read this post which sums up everything there is to know about me and why I'm running for school board.  Personal Connection -  I've lived in Jenkintown for nearly 25 years. Together with my husband Vincent we have two Jenkintown HS graduates (2019 and 2020) as well as two more children still currently enrolled at the high school.  I'm running for school board because our family has had the pleasure of being involved with the Jenkintown School District even before our oldest was enrolled in kindergarten. Our children have participated in nearly every activity that Jenkintown has to offer from: the After Care Program World Affairs Art Club Reading Olympics and Mini Singers at JES as well as just about every Middle and High School sport Theater Arts presentation music program honors society and extracurricular activity offered at JHS.  In Jenkintown our children have been served by the Gifted and Talented program provided 504 resources and support and participated in Speech and Occupational Therapies throughout the years. I know what it feels like to be a parent advocating for the best interest of their children. My hope is through the Jenkintown School Board that I will be able to continue that advocacy to include YOUR children as well. Whether you currently have children enrolled in the district or not I wholeheartedly believe that a thriving school system is the key to a vibrant community. Therefore I intend to promote the best interest of the school not just for the children but for the benefit of the community at large.  Platform -  My primary objective is to advocate for the best interest of all children served by our district. This includes both academic success (college/career readiness) as well as development of the whole person (social/emotional wellness music/arts development personal growth community support extracurricular opportunity). Success should be personalized to fit the needs of each child. Second I hope to engage the community to support a thriving school district. I believe that the districts mission and vision statements should be prominently displayed on the district website (not buried deeply within) and that parents staff and community members be made aware of the boards intentions and priorities in all aspects of school affairs and have a voice in the consideration of new policies and procedures. Our community is eager to assist the school in the achievement of this vision and I hope to foster those connections in the interest of students. Third I hope to ensure an optimal school environment with fully trained and supported staff and a safe social emotional and behavioral environment for students. This would potentially include expansion of mental health resources anti-bullying campaigns and equity initiatives in hiring and curriculum.  Education and Professional Development -  I have a BA in Psychology from The University of Rhode Island and an MSW from The University of Pennsylvania. As a social worker I have specialized training in multiple areas relating to the provision of quality education services including racism LBGTQIA issues intimate partner violence socioeconomic disparity homelessness mental health child welfare and many others. Most recently my continued professional development includes Implicit Bias training with the CWRC and a series on Confronting Racial Injustice and the Inequities of the Pandemic through The University of Pennsylvania.    Professional Experience -  I have spent most of my career (nearly 30 years) working with and advocating for children and adolescents. I specialized in the investigation of sexual abuse (as well as other types of child abuse and neglect) for many years and later helped establish collaborative systems and organizations in Montgomery County and at the Pennsylvania state level for all child serving systems. Additionally I practiced medical social work at The Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and school social work in Cheltenham School District facilitating groups and providing support to children K-12 receiving special education services. Currently I work in an inpatient hospital assessing the substance use and psychiatric needs of adolescents and adults. In addition I am a trainer and consultant for the PA Child Welfare Training Program educating child welfare case workers and supervisors throughout the state on a variety of topics. I have also developed and researched curriculum for the CWRC and most recently worked on DEI initiatives in child welfare education and service provision. I believe that my knowledge of child serving systems will enhance the Board. Further I believe that my dedication to collaborative ideals will strengthen the relationship between the Jenkintown School Board the school district staff and the community.  Volunteerism -  I have volunteered for many years within the school and have had the pleasure of getting to know most if not all of the teaching and support staff here at Jenkintown. I was a homeroom mother from the time of my oldest child's kindergarten year all the way through my youngest child's 6th grade graduation and everywhere in between sometimes for multiple classrooms at one time. I took over coordination of the Mini Singers trip when it was no longer going to be teacher-led organized every Rec Night that my children attended arranged the 6th grade graduation and pool parties worked back stage for theater events chaperoned every field and music adjudication trip possible cooked weekly spaghetti dinners for the football team served breakfast with the Lady Drakes at Applebee's and most recently coordinated the JHS Honors trips to Dorney Park and planned out the parade route for last year's Color Day Parade. Basically if there has been a volunteer opportunity at Jenkintown I've jumped at the chance to be involved. In addition Ive served as a MDT Board member for Montgomery County Children and Youth and have been a frequent volunteer for The Breathing Room Foundation and Jenkintown Newcomers Club. I am eager to continue this spirit of volunteerism and serve the school community as a member of the Jenkintown School Board of Directors.  Im always happy to chat one on one about your questions or concerns.  Please consider voting for me on May 18th! Thank you for your consideration.    Add to Your Post Boost Post,political,Facebook
We are coming into the final days of the campaign and I have been fielding a lot of questions from concerned parents in the district. Let me put my views out there for the 2 questions everyone seems to be asking. Let me be clear these are my views and may not reflect that of the majority of the BOE.  1). Masking and Vaccines: I am not in favor of masking or vaccine mandates. I am not a doctor and do not feel comfortable giving that type of advice. Parents must have the opportunity to consult with their medical professionals and decide a course of action that is appropriate for their children.  2). Critical Race Theory or CRT has no business being taught in a PreK - 12 school environment. History needs to be taught the good/bad/ugly not from a sole perspective but as a whole.  This Tuesday please get out and vote. I ask that you would cast one of your three votes for me and continue to allow me to be your voice on the Northeastern Local School Districts Board of Education.,political,Facebook
Newton Needs Common Sense Leadership!  We residents have waited patiently hoping you would lead us in the right direction.  Our schools are slipping our police and fire demoralized crime is on the raise. Water bills are out of control city infrastructure is crumbling and bias is rampant in Newton City Government.  Where is our city council leadership - they are supposed to be the voters voice!  The reopening of our schools after covid was an utter disgrace; every other community around us did a better job than Newton - we failed our kids!  Newton once had the highest ranked schools in the state; where are we now?  Newton was once ranked the safest cities in America; now we cant even be found on the list. We are rapidly slipping becoming unsafe.  Our police department is demoralized; what city leader stood strongly beside our police when they were attacked by a Defund the Police mob right next to the police station?  Former Newton Police Chief Howard Mintz emailed the city council on 2/4/2021 saying The following is one of the reasons why the relationship between the police department and the city council is strained regarding Ward 5 City Councilor Bill Humphreys posts: ACAB 1312  All Cops Are Bastards. What has the Current City Council Leadership done about it?  Ask any Newton Police Officer: who in the city leadership has stepped in to support them as they were being vilified?  We ask our Newton Firefighters to run into burning buildings to save our families when we need help; ask them who in leadership has their back?  Roads and infrastructure just take a drive around the city. Its bad really bad. Why cant we do a better job instead of just band aids?  Our Water Bills are out of control; why cant we get accurate readings for our water usage anymore?  Why is Newton leaking and wasting more water than all the communities arounds us? The go-to excuse that our infrastructure is old - doesnt fly. Every community around us has aging infrastructure; Newton should not be the worst Newton should be leading the way on this issue. Invest now to protect the environment save our most precious natural resource: Water.  All claim to be for diversity and inclusion; yet this past week there were more offensive comments and actions at city hall. With the opportunity to lead and address intolerance at Newton City Hall there should have been outrage from all our leaders (not just Brenda Noel) instead they sat silent  their silence is being complicit.  City Council leadership have done too little too late for too long.  Our fellow good citizens throughout the city must say: this will NOT be tolerated anymore   it is time all of Newton stands up and says: no more!  Our community when we come together we matter. We make a difference. We need you to DO YOUR PART Click here to see who to vote to bring common sense back to Newton City Hall: SAVENONANTUM.COM Our Candidates Our Candidates,political,Facebook
"ENVIRONMENT VS. ECONOMY The philosophy that holds the environment and the economy to be in conflict with each other is a misguided farce. It is only major corporations with very specific self-serving interests who posit that the economy and environment are in conflict with each other. The health of the environment is directly related to the economy especially here in Maine where the super-majority of our state's revenue is directly related to ecological tourism and environmentally based industries. It is our national and state parks lakes oceans woods and mountains that stimulate the economy here -- by attracting people to fish hunt hike bird watch snowmobile ski swim boat; by providing a bounty of natural resources to support agricultural and forest industries that yield paper products blueberries potatoes fisheries and more. Without a healthy environment in Maine we have nothing to subside on. Ultimately there are two immediately pressing environmental concerns that are tied together: climate change and the capacity of human culture to adapt (and adapt QUICKLY) to address the infrastructural transformations needed to meet the challenge of climate change. While it may be obvious that climate change is the single most environmental issue affecting Maine the deeper question is ""Do we have the capacity to change society to address the issue?"" The solutions are all readily available. Science has given us a multitude of solutions to immediately combat climate change. The only thing holding back is the political will to start TODAY to implement the solutions we know can reverse our current climate trajectory. The biggest obstacle is political will. Time and time again the major political parties have proven that they do not have the foresight or ability to take initiative swiftly enough to make a difference before it is too late.

"CAPITAL GAINS TAX HIKE  There is much conversation in regards to President Biden's proposed capital gains tax increase. The standard arguments are troped out against the tax hike: it will hurt investment interest rates will rise some guy won't be able to buy a yacht.  A tax rise is not necessary to fund Biden's infrastructure-plus proposals but because people practically have a heart attack whenever the federal deficit is brought up it would probably be wise to close the deficit with a higher long term capital gains tax in order to save people the heartache. But there are other reasons as well.  Currently assets sold after holding that asset for more than a year are taxed at highly favorable long term capital gains tax rates of between 0% and 20% depending on the tax bracket; while assets sold within a year of purchase are taxed at generally higher ordinary income tax rates. The long term favorable rate is to encourage investors to make long term investments rather than to engage in short term speculative trading which arguably has less if any social value. Biden proposes raising the long term rate to 39.6 percent which when combined with the current 3.8% investment surtax on high income investors would create a long term federal capital gains tax of 43.4% on high income investors.  As talked about often on this Page taxes and borrowing are not necessary to fund Federal spending. The U.S. with its own currency can create as much money as it would like it is not dependent on funding sources. Taxation and borrowing are necessary however to take money out of the economy in order to control inflation in the goods services and asset markets; taxation and borrowing are also effective tools for interest rate targeting; also Treasury securities are useful for investment portfolio stability; and taxation is useful to direct capital into socially useful purposes and for wealth distribution purposes.  The effect of the long term capital gain tax increase would be several fold and we will touch upon a couple likely impacts. ""According to the Tax Policy Center the top 1% of households report 75% of long-term capital gains."" (Wall Street Journal April 24 2021). If this report is correct then the tax rise is likely to fall mostly on the top 1%. It is difficult to see how this would be a problem. The top 1% are fabulously wealthy and a tax increase would likely not crimp their consumption patterns. In other words the tax will come out of asset holdings and this is good for a couple reasons. The sale of assets in order to pay the tax should deflate what many argue are inflated asset markets. Less money chasing these assets will deflate overvalued asset prices. This is a good thing. Also the wealthy who pay this tax will consequently be less wealthy and this will beneficially reduce the wealth gap which tears at the Nation's social fabric. That's two good things to come from raising the tax. If by chance the higher tax crimps consumption spending among the wealthy a third good thing would happen: less consumption. The well-off consume too much. This is damaging both to the environment and as stated undermines communal values.  To the extent that the higher capital gains tax filters down to those beneath the top 1% the same arguments can be made only in different proportions as consumption takes on a larger proportion of the consumption-investment mix. There are many good reasons to increase the long term capital gains tax. There are also counter arguments.  The first being that the higher tax will discourage asset sales which will lead to an inefficient allocation of resources. On the other hand the slower turnover of assets would reduce the dynamism in the U.S. economy which leaves many workers often gasping for breath in the rapidly changing job market. The follow-up argument is the depletion of private capital will cause interest rates to rise; this is a difficult argument to make as the Federal Reserve (FED) since the Financial crisis has demonstrated an ability to successfully target interest rates from short to long term rates across the yield curve. Another argument is that higher taxes on the wealthy will create a shortage of private capital for investment. This is similar to the interest rate argument but is somewhat different and there are two aspects to it. There are two types of capital: debt and equity capital--equity being the at-risk capital that owners put-up when they invest in a business.  To the extent that money is borrowed or debt created or derived from the commercial banking sector the argument that higher capital gains tax rates will reduce the availability of debt capital is nonsense. If banks see good lending opportunities the loans will be made. Commercial banks create new money when they lend and this new money creation is limited only by a typical 10% reserve requirement. If banks were to find themselves short of reserves a near impossibility given the current environment in which banks are awash in excess reserves the FED will willingly provide the necessary reserves in order to protect the payments system. In terms of shrinking the pool of equity capital there is likely merit to this argument. But as stated earlier with asset markets likely inflated anything which absorbs excessive liquidity out these markets is a good thing.  In the end the capital gains tax increase represents a transfer of resources from the private sector where much investment is channeled into obnoxious and environmentally damaging consumption production to the public sector for long overdue physical and human capital infrastructure development which in the long term will support the private sector.  While there may be elements of the tax which require scrutiny generally the tax represents an advance forward for a nation which has suffered broad public disinvestment in order to serve the short term profit desires of the private sector during the past 40 years of neoliberal nonsense.",political,Facebook
Why sacrifice public safety to political expediency?  On Tuesday night my opponent as a member of the Hopkins School Board voted to defund their high schools School Resource Officer. Whatever the boards justification at the time or since there is no doubt that their actions have made the students in Hopkins and Minnetonka less safe and added uncertainty at a time when families of school-children are dealing with too much already.  School Resource Officers are an integral part of providing a safe learning environment. They are an important link between the community and our first responders and play a role in letting teachers and administrators focus on their jobs and not outside distractions. But most importantly  and unfortunately  its the job that we hope they never have to do that makes them so important.  Talking about how gun violence is a very real public health threat was a centerpiece of my state legislative campaigns. Nearly alone among my colleagues I spoke out about the need to pass responsible gun control legislation. I want to see fewer guns on the streets and I think there should be more strict background checks in place. But even if all of that were to come to pass tomorrow it wont change the reality that resource officers are necessary to the safety of children in school.  Perhaps as short-sighted as defunding the resource officer position at Hopkins High School has been the rationale repeatedly put forward to justify the decision. Decrying tough budget choices  creating conflict where there neednt be any  and presenting the decision as an either/or proposition between school safety and mental health programs is simply pandering to appease special interests.  For more than 20 years I have worked with mental health advocacy organizations. I have first-hand experience with how mental health issues can affect a family. My campaign has been endorsed by some of our states leading mental health advocates. And during my time in the legislature I authored and testified for bills to increase funding for mental health programs  specifically to reduce teen suicide. Using mental health as the excuse for defunding the school resource officer program reduces the work of mental health advocates to a political slogan and insults the valuable contributions that resource officers make every day in communities across the state.,political,Facebook

Recently my opponent made yet another false and misleading claim about me as a person - suggesting that I have no idea what it takes to create jobs.  In ten years I have never lowered myself to false or misleading attacks as part of a political campaign. I simply won't do it. I believe it is our responsibility as candidates to showcase our records our ideas our principles and what we would actually do if elected. I have always done that and will continue to do so.  However I will also defend myself when necessary.  My bio including my work experience is on my website For the record I have managed several different insurance agencies over the years and have hired and trained dozens of employees -insurance agents and customer service reps. I also work as a recruiter in real estate training and mentoring new and experienced agents alike. I have created many jobs through my investments in real estate and my appreciation for a free market economy.  More importantly in my role as a State Senator I recognize that my job is not to create jobs but rather to create an environment so others can do so. This is why I have worked hard to support policies beneficial to that goal and oppose others that prevent it. I have a 100% voting record from both the CBIA and NFIB the two leading pro-business groups in our state.      It is interesting that my opponent has previously attacked me for my efforts to prevent a premature and drastic increase in the minimum wage to $15.00 and the improperly funded new payroll tax required under the new paid FMLA law.  I urge anyone who is in favor of increasing the minimum wage to watch my remarks from the Senate debate in their entirety. This is an issue that sounds simple but has far-reaching impact.    Those two bills themselves are job killers. I wonder. How does one position themselves to be both pro-business and job creation while supporting more regulatory burdens and accepting the endorsement of the pro-socialism and anti business Working Families party?  If you are curious about what the Working Families Party stands for I urge you to visit this link and read about them and how out of touch they are with our community. I would not accept their endorsement under any circumstances.,political,Facebook
A brief analogy to demonstrate why I decided to run for School Board. Please feel free to share!  A School District is like a hand and the fingers are:  1) Kids 2) Parents 3) Teachers 4) Board 5) Community  If one or more of the fingers is damaged or broken the hand will still function  but usually not without pain to the entire hand or at a diminished capacity.  I believe that is where our School District is right now. Some of the fingers are feeling a bit damaged or possibly broken and with that the school district components have struggled to work in unison together as a whole. This has been demonstrated with the lack of acceptance and frustration in regards to teacher pay increases frustration surrounding the bond measure which built two new elementary schools & remodeled the high school and the failure of two levies with the razor thin win of the third.  I feel drawn to volunteer my time energy and experience in order to help build a team environment and try and get the hand not only functioning but thriving with all the fingers working together as a whole.  Please join me in this endeavor. Together we can help heal this district and help our district move forward in unity for children today and in years to come.  ~ Audra Messegee-Evans,political,Facebook
Grateful to have the endorsement of TFLD Director Bonnie Mccalister. Thank you for the vote of confidence. I promise to continue your spirit of giving and service!  My name is Bonnie McCalister. My husband and I lived in Tanglewood Forest with our 3 daughters since November of 2007. I absolutely loved my neighborhood. It was the perfect location with kind neighbors and a sense of community. We felt like it was our forever home.  I was elected to the Tanglewood Forest board in 2016 with high hopes that I could be a part of making my neighborhood better. I served until early 2020 when I resigned. Although I loved serving my neighbors the board experience with all of its conflict drama and pitting neighbors against neighbors got to be too much for me. My husband and I decided that I should resign so we could regain our quality of life.  It broke my heart but I had accomplished all I thought I could given the very negative environment that the Board was. Something had to change and I knew that it was only a matter of time before the right person came along to make some changes to the board.  I have known Joseph Castille for approximately 3 years. In that time I have attended fundraisers that he and his company have hosted for Homeless Outreach initiatives fundraisers for Veterans Programs and various other community initiatives. He cares about our community and actually puts up his own time and money up to make these things happen.  I have talked several times at great length with him about Tanglewood Forest and his vision to return the District and Board to a positive place that neighbors want to be a part of. He has demonstrated a focus intensity and results-driven approach to anything he puts his mind to. He works non-stop and never runs out of energy for the things that are important to him.  I think he would make an excellent Board member and he definitely has me and my husbands vote.  All our love to Tanglewood  Bonnie McCalister,political,Facebook

COVID AND PLASTIC One negative environmental impact of Covid-19 is the increased production and use of plastic products -- from disposable plastic gloves to the prohibition grocery stores place on use of reusable cloth bags which then results in increased use and disposal of plastic bags. The increase of plastic products resulting from Covid-19 regulations will end up hurting the environment more contributing further to global warming and then contributing to the higher frequency of viruses infecting our species. With so many plastic products in use now we need to urgently look at transitioning from oil-based plastics. There is no reason disposable one-use plastic items need to be made with polymers that take decades to disappear. We should use plastics made from hemp and other plant-based 'plastics' which biodegrade within days or weeks when added to the waste stream. At the least any plastic products made for one-time use should be made from hemp or similar resources. It is absurd to use oil-based plastics that take decades to break down or that send nasty chemicals into the air when burned to use a plastic fork to take a few bites of a cake. This is nonsense! (And selfish of us as a species). It's time to take the opportunity to review what sources are used to produce plastic products in the wake of this pandemic which has increased our reliance on plastics.,political,Facebook

Joyce Shepard recently had a press conference because peaceful protesters came to her home a rare occasion when she was forced to engage with the public.  She wanted everyone to know her position would not be changed on the destruction of the Old Atlanta Prison Farm and 150 acres inside the largest undisturbed greenspace inside the perimeter. It is quite unusual for a politician to take off the mask of pretending to care about public input and tell us she views the public discourse as mere window dressing and an annoyance. The Instagram live video press conference was happening at the same time as public comments so we also know she had no interest in hearing from her public.  She boldly dug in her heels on her corporation first and environmentally destructive agenda. Sheperd mentioned the condition of the current training facilities as having mold and being in poor condition and offered a tour of these facilities. I would ask why the Atlanta Police Foundation has not put any resources into repairing these existing facilities? The APF and Sheperd have a very cozy relationship yet they did not offer any assistance when these facilities were full of mold and undrinkable water? It's especially odd considering that Councilmember Sheperd is the head of the public safety committee she would be in right position to fix these issues but didn't choose to do so.  Who is making decisions in this city? If our Councilmembers have declared they will ignore us do we have a true representative government?  I call on Councilmember Sheperd to recuse herself from any upcoming votes regarding the Old Prison Farm lease proposal since she is broadcasting that she plans on ignoring her constituents and the ever louder voice of the public crying out to preserve our greenspace and to consider other options. There are 14 other members of council and they will answer to their voters depending on what they chose to do from here on out.  The seeds of my run for City Council were planted when I saw that the Gulch development scheme was approved while receiving near zero interest or support from the public. It highlighted how much power a handful of corporations and monied interests such as developers have over many of our elected officials while the majority of voters in the City of Atlanta are ignored.  I'm going to keep fighting for the environment and the people and to return the city to a representative government.  If a city council member is unwilling or unable to listen to their public they do not deserve their office. They are our representatives when they are not representing us they must be replaced. Please vote on November 2nd and consider if your candidate is going to fight for the preservation of our environment or not.,political,Facebook

MODERN MONETARY THEORY: MISREPRESENTED ONCE AGAIN  Recently on a Bloomberg financial podcast a senior executive at J.P. Morgan stated he did not believe in Modern Monetary Theory (MMT). MMT is a controversial monetary theory which offers a description of monetary operations which challenge orthodox economic and financial thinking. Within current MMT reasoning there is a belief there is room for fiscal expansion which when coordinated with the Nation's central bank--the Federal Reserve (FED) will enable public investment in human and physical capital i.e. infrastructure without inflationary consequences. The J.P. Morgan executive argued that in order for MMT to succeed that it would also have to fail: that to accumulate the debt which he implies is acceptable to MMT for public investment then even if the investment proved good for the economy the accumulated debt would then tank the economy.  It was the strangest comment that one could expect from an investment banker and it also misrepresented MMT views. First from an investment banker perspective it is strange to state that debt issuance condemns an institution to failure. Bankers afterall are peddlers of private sector debt issued on the belief that the gains from private investment will generally exceed the cost of capital. Government debt issued in order to facilitate productive investment: physical and human likewise has the potential to create long term gains in the economy which exceed the cost of capital. So it was strange to hear an investment banker ignore the growth potential associated with public debt issuance which finances physical and human capital investment: the type of investment promoted within the MMT framework.  The MMT public sector investment portfolio would include such things as green energy investment in education and most importantly a federal job guarantee program which would offer a job to anyone who seeks a job at a livable wage with health and child care benefits--a near full employment program.  A legitimate concern here should not be the level of debt so long as the associated funds are directed into productive investment but the concern should be the potential inflationary impact of large scale investment which creates individual earnings not yet matched by an increase in the provision of consumer goods and services. The temporary mismatch between increased earnings from new investment and the availability of goods and services may create short to medium term inflationary pressures in these consumer markets. One market concern undoubtedly is the belief that once inflation begins it feeds on itself into an upward spiral of increased inflationary pressure which can only be resolved through monetary and fiscal tightenings i.e. an induced recession.  It is not clear to me whether MMT has adequately addressed the short term inflationary impact of broad public infrastructure investment. MMT definitely recognizes that Federal spending is limited by potential inflationary effects of Federal spending and it seems they differ from the broader market participants in their view of the size and scope of available resources which can be put to work before real resource restraints create inflationary pressure. In other words it seems that MMT believes there currently exists greater slack in the economy than the broader market participants believe and it also seems that MMT believes that increased productive capacity which meets consumer demand can come online rather quickly in order to thwart these inflationary pressures. The latter view is undoubtedly challenged in a trade restricted environment.  It appears that MMT takes the long view and the bigger point is that green energy will eventually be a more efficient source of energy while high tech education combined with liberal arts training will make us both more productive and better citizens. The federal jobs programs will assist in the development of work skills which will further enhance national productivity. Debt used to finance such activity would be a very good use of debt and will not inflict damage on the national economy but rather will enhance long term growth in a noninflationary manner.  Much of the above discussion is premised on a misrepresentation of the MMT view on public debt. The J.P. Morgan Executive's view is premised on the idea that Federal deficit spending must be funded with debt. This is not the MMT view. Federal debt issuance is a policy option not a requirement for deficit spending.  The MMT view is that a sovereign monetary authority such as the U.S. which creates its own free floating currency creates money when it spends and destroys money through taxation and borrowing. Money creation and money destruction need not be equal. Spending need not be fully funded but only 'funded' to an extent and in a manner which prevents inflation in the goods services and asset markets. In other words deficit spending need not be funded with debt: the money for deficit spending is created through the act of spending. An equivalent debt issuance merely destroys an equal amount of money thereby neutralizing any inflationary impact of the deficit spending. Debt issuance i.e. money destruction is a mere tool for inflation control and for other convenient purposes i.e. private portfolio investment stability store of value interest rate targeting . . . .  Furthermore the Executive's narrative ignored debt management techniques discussed previously on this Page such as debt extinguishment the Platinum coin idea which grew out of the 2011 budget ceiling crisis taxation of the well-off rather than borrowing from the well-off and Federal Reserve perpetual holdings of Treasury debt on its balance sheet--which is costless to the U.S. taxpayer. The Executive's brief discussion of MMT was yet another false representation of MMT views.  Generally it is wise to dismiss about 85% of corporate reporting on MMT. Most commentators have not seriously examined MMT; others are in no mood to change the status quo. Large capital interests in the private sector simply do not want to concede additional space to the public sector regardless of the long term growth potential associated with public sector investment.  Undoubtedly the Nation's long term productivity potential would be greatly enhanced by the above public sector investments. But in the long run the current investment class won't be here. Perhaps this is part of the problem. The other part of the problem lies in the short term investment horizon of private sector firms a response to investor demands for short term profits which do not align with the long term investment objectives of the Federal government.,political,Facebook
Letter to the editor of the Granite State News by Carrie Duran and myself responding to John McDonalds and Brodie Deshaiess letter to the editor promising not to raise taxes.  A recent letter from John McDonald and Brodie Deshaies in the Granite State News is very succinct and to the point. It urges people to vote on the single issue of taxes quoting Calvin Coolidge the president who ushered in the Great Depression. It concludes with: A vote for us is a vote against any sales or income tax.  We would like to remind our colleagues that we are in the midst of the worst economic recession since the Great Depression as well as a pandemic that has affected almost 7400 NH residents  not to mention all their families. By July of this year the state had lost 78634 jobs and Wolfeboro lost 680 jobs compared to the same month a year earlier. Many people have lost their health insurance along with their jobs. Hourly wage earners who managed to keep their jobs now have reduced schedules and income and suffer from food and rent insecurity. Students lost almost half a year of school and are facing diminished learning prospects for the coming school year. Parents are experiencing urgent childcare issues due to school closings or partial school openings.  And because state tax revenues are rapidly declining in this environment the state government has accelerated its downshifting of financial responsibilities to our local government budgets. Wolfeboro can expect even less state funding for services than the already low base of the last several years. Even though New Hampshire is #1 in the country in terms of per capita income we rank 50th in terms of state funding for education.  Promising to not raise sales and income taxes is irrelevant when the average persons income has dropped so precipitously. This is certainly not the time to raise taxes. Its like the proverbial squeezing water from a stone. There is no water when incomes and jobs have been so hard hit. Taxes are not the issue: we need to find ways to be resourceful and creative including finding ways to channel to our community any Federal funding that might come to the state.  Given the economic hit the state has taken due to the pandemic continuing the mantra of no taxes is the wrong way to vote for our leadership. It only serves to perpetuate a divisive ideological issue. Wolfeboro deserves representation at the State House who will be constructive and collaborative who will search with open minds for practical solutions to the problems that our town will be facing and fight to bring dignity to all our residents.  This is our pledge to you if we have the honor of serving our town.  Carrie Martin Duran and John Wall Wolfeboro,political,Facebook

"2 Week until Election Day! ***PLEASE SHARE THIS***  ***PROPOSITIONS THAT ARE ON THIS YEARS BALLOT***  NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE VOTING FOR YOU MUST EDUCATE YOURSELVES ON THESE PROPOSITIONS.  This is a direct link to the NYS BOE's website that explains everything in detail. The are 3 CONSTITUTIONAL amendments that are on the ballot. (#1#3#4)   I will be voting NO on all 4 Proposition's and I will explain why below.  PROP. #1 Redistricting Amendment  This weakens the independent redistricting process enacted by Voters in 2014 before it's been allowed to work:  a) Designed to change the redistricting rules on the day the Independent Redistricting Commission must submit its plan to the legislature this year. b) Eliminates the safeguards built into the law that ensures BOTH PARTIES have an equal role at the Independent Redistricting Commission. c) Reduces the voting requirement from 66% to 60% which makes it easier for Democrats (who currently hold a super-majority) to OVERRULE the Independent Redistricting Commission. d) Creates a mechanism for the Democrats to circumvent the independent commission process by refusing to allow a vote on a redistricting plan which would give Democrats in the legislature a free hand to draw the maps.  PROP #2 Right to clean air clean water and a healthful environment.  ""Who doesn't believe in that???"" This bill is VAGUE and I believe intended to be vague. There is no specificity on how any of that is going to be accomplished. This is a BROAD bill that gives the State the ability to cite this ""law"" whenever they want to do something that they will ""claim"" will ""protect the environment"". For example ..... let's say they want to outlaw all gas and oil furnaces or outlaw all diesel vehicles .... they could use this ""law"" as their justification! Again no specificity no plan nothing just fill in the blank.  Before someone try's to pull a political spin on me and say that I'm ""not for the environment"" because I'm voting NO on this prop. Other than my explanation above I have been a vocal advocate for sewers all across Long Island especially in the low-lying areas. This infrastructure improvement will go a long way in cleaning up our water quality. Additionally I have PERSONALLY partook in beach clean-ups KIC clean-ups and clean-ups throughout various waterways during my lifetime. My personal residence EXCEEDS many GEO friendly and pollution reduction recommendations and I built it that way with the environment in mind!  PROP #3 Same day Voter Registration  Eliminates the requirement that citizens register to vote at least 10 days before an election.  a) Enables voter registration at the polling place where poll workers will be unable to properly verify proof of residency and eligibility to vote. b) Newly register voters will vote on the machines instead of affidavit ballots making it impossible to disqualify the votes of those later determined to be ineligible to vote. c) This is an invitation to voter fraud  PROP #4 No Excuse Absentee Voting  ""The legislature may by general law provide a manner in which and the time and place at which qualified voters may vote and for the return and canvass of their votes in any election.""  a) Eliminates the requirement for absentee voting that the voter will be absent from the county or unable to appear at the polling place because of illness or physical disability. b) This can lead to universal vote by mail and ballot harvesting.

Loving our public lands is inextricably linked to protecting our environment. Moving away from harmful practices is one way we ensure pristine outdoor recreation for generations to come. My opponent voted against a bill aimed at protecting workers in the coal industry and preserving our environment.  SB 264 - to revise laws related to coal-fired generation remediation activities. This pro-labor and pro-environment bill will require coal plant owners to pay a prevailing wage to employees working on coal remediation demolition and maintenance. This legislation supports the transition of Montana workers away from coal energy and is a critical step toward reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. LOLA VOTED NO.

Annette Glenn needs to apologize to every law enforcement officer and Black person in our community.  She and her friends chose to knowingly tell lies about me in TV ads to score political points while USING the police and Black citizens as pawns.  She doesn't care if police officers saw these lies and thought I wanted to take their jobs. She doesn't care if Black people saw these lies and felt portrayed (yet again) as dangerous and unwelcome in our community.  What matters to her and her friends is staying in power - no matter the cost and regardless of what is true.  This is shameful.  She owes them all an apology for using them.  And because I know she won't I'll say it. I'm sorry that dirty politics is creating this environment that is shutting down the conversations and the voices needed to find real solutions. I am sorry that the people who claim to be leaders show no signs of actual real leadership or integrity.  Annette prove me wrong. Apologize for your lies and your ads and the hundreds of thousands of dollars you spent to propagate them and all the people you hurt.  Don't apologize to me for lying about me apologize to everyone who has been impacted. ************************ Edited to add: I have always supported our police officers. In fact in 2018 I was one of only a few Democratic Candidates endorsed by the Police Officers Association of Michigan (2020 endorsement pending). Annette was not endorsed by them and yet falsely claimed to have the endorsement in mailers  another lie.,political,Facebook
News to Share... I received this letter from Don Defenthaler who worked in the Martin County Property Appraiser's office for many years.  His letter demonstrates a biased culture that permeates through the office and highlights the need for a fresh perspective and new leadership built on integrity and a strong commitment to treating all employees with respect and trust.  Fields not fit for Property Appraiser Job As a state-certified real estate appraiser I worked for the Martin County Property Appraisers Office as Director of Appraisal Services for 8 years. Unfortunately I made the mistake of mentioning I would be interested in running for Property Appraiser. Big mistake!  I was praised by the Property Appraiser for formulas and procedures I developed the quality of my work and accomplishments but from that point forward I felt like I had a target on my back. Jenny Fields worked in customer service and as manager of data input.  She was promoted to Assistant Director without the experience necessary. Apparently there was a plan in place for Fields to take over the Property Appraiser position. She scrutinized criticized and controlled the work of staff members in all departments. Her leadership style created a toxic work environment with employees feeling stressed overworked and even bullied as was my experience.  Fields did not understand appraisal methodology. She states she has taken numerous appraisal courses but cites only two Department of Revenue appraisal courses (which take four days to complete). She has eight days of coursework under her belt?  Fields came to me with valuation questions and questioned my 30-years of expertise regarding my decision to revalue a property and was adamant that the property should be valued her way. I made it clear I would never intentionally do anything to artificially increase or decrease the value of a property for any reason.  As a four-term City Commissioner Kelli Glass Leighton displays integrity and genuine concern for our community. Glass Leighton has experience creating a work culture of mutual trust listening being well-informed efficiency in operations communication transparency and employee appreciation. Kelli Glass Leighton is a proven leader. She has my vote for Martin County Property Appraiser.  Don Defenthaler,political,Facebook
CLIMATE URGENCY REQUIRES ELECTING GREENS  We are in the midst of a climate emergency whether we declare it so or not -- in Maine the United States and globally. The frustration I share with many is that our government and the way we allocate political power in American democracy -- channeling it through two opposing major parties -- is ineffective and too slow to effect meaningful change in time enough to make the difference that is needed. We do not have enough time to wait for Democrats and Republicans to get their acts together. The parties both of them are so glacial in their responses that the glaciers will have melted by the time they react to the crisis. While it is what it is for now we absolutely need to start allocating political power differently by giving rise to new perspectives new political parties and electing representatives outside of the standard usual two-party gridlock in order to expedite and drive home the urgency of responding to climate change. We have an emergency in place right now and the Democrats are not up for the challenge because they cater to moderate Republicans and overlook the urgency of progressive change. Electing Greens in local down-ticket races is the best thing that could happen to the Democratic Party as it lends credibility and legitimacy to the urgent progressive actions such as addressing climate change that are currently needed. While I support many objectives and premises of most versions of a Green New Deal I am disappointed at how both parties have latched onto the term itself and bandied it about as a rallying cry for partisan purposes either for or against. Regardless of what you want to title any proposal I support any and all proposals that benefit the environment.,political,Facebook

Housing Perspective - Second Foreclosure Crisis Unlikely  There is no doubt that the coronavirus pandemic was an unprecedented shock. However unlike the 2008 financial crisis housing was a bystander as external forces disrupted the macro environment rather than a culprit in building up systemic fundamental imbalances in the financial system. That is an important distinction when it comes to the question of both foreclosures and home prices. Would-be homebuyers who are waiting for a surge in foreclosures and for prices to plunge are likely to find themselves facing even higher prices next year. To add potential insult to injury many forecasts suggest that homebuyers will be facing higher interest rates after the crisis as well. There are many reasons why its not 2008 all over again. First the economic impacts were largely concentrated in retail stores bars restaurants and hotels while workers in high-wage sectors were relatively insulated. This group of high-wage workers not only remained employed at a much higher rate but they had a renewed passion for homeownership because of the nature of the crisis increased flexibility due to remote working and the lowest mortgage rates ever recorded. Housing demand which typically outstrips supply in California became even more ferocious and solid price growth before and during COVID-19 has created a market where 98.9% of homeowners in California have home equity. However the economy also had much better fundamentals coming into the crisis. This was a huge shock but one happening to what was otherwise a relatively healthy economy. Homebuyers since the Great Recession have tended to have higher levels of income above-average credit scores and much larger down payments. In addition the amount of home equity that homeowners liquidated to spend on cars boats RVs and vacations was a fraction of what it was back in 2006 even though prices are much higher than they were back then. This all adds up to a much smaller amount of systemic risk than there was present in the economy in 2008. And better fundamentals have already kept California more resilient. Delinquencies peaked last year at 6.8% and have been falling for the past 4 quarters consecutivelyfar below the 2009 peak of 11.3%. In addition the statistics from the federal forbearance program suggest several encouraging conclusions. Last year nearly 8.5% of mortgages were in forbearance. Now that number is just 3%. According to the exits over 40% never missed any payments missed some but already paid them all back or have since paid their loan off in full. Another 40% have come to a resolution with their banks who seem to be taking more of a were all in this together approach this time around. Taking all of this into consideration it suggests that the number of potential foreclosures in the 20000-30000 range on the high side. This pales to the 1.125 million foreclosures started between 2008 and 2010. Even if every delinquent loan went belly-up at one time there were 350000 delinquent loans in California thats still  the number that were foreclosed on last time. This isnt to say that every homeowner will be able to stay in their home or that every investor will decide to remain in business. Some folks have faced serious financial distress dont have a lot of home equity and will eventually foreclose. However the number of folks this is likely to happen to is a fraction of what it was last time. As such would-be homebuyers may not get the flood of inventory or the drop in prices that theyre waiting for. Depending on how long they decide to wait they may only succeed in paying more for their homes at even higher rates of interest. COPYRIGHT  CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS,political,Facebook

Although I have not seen them I understand that there are comments being made on social media that portray me as being against diversity. I believe they are coming from a place of legitimate concern and these are fair questions. Let me give the best answer I can to the concerns expressed.  I strongly support diversity in the schools. We should strive to have a candidate hiring pool for teachers and administrators that is diverse in terms of race gender career background skills and point of view. All students deserve a learning environment where they have access to resources necessary for them to reach their greatest potential. We must work to see that all students are treated equitably and with respect so they feel included in the BH public school community.  I dont think racial slurs are acceptable in a school environment but I think that removing children from activities and interests in a no tolerance environment simply creates another problem. I believe there are more effective ways of addressing the issue.  I recognize that racism exists. However I have observed the term racism being used in public meetings unjustifiably in seeking to limit speech that does not meet the criteria in my mind of racism. I understand the right to preserve decorum in a public meeting but I am a firm believer in the First Amendment and think speakers should be allowed to express their views.  Lastly I am not an expert on matters of diversity but I have been learning and hope to learn more.,political,Facebook
Recently some in the community have questioned the districts use of Syntero to provide mental health support for our K-8 schools suggesting that theres some vague cause for alarm. Look I get that Syntero sounds like the name of a mysterious corporation in some random Vin Diesel movie. But creating baseless whisper campaigns around mental health is not just wrong  its dangerous it puts our kids at risk and it needs to stop.  To get the facts I have spoken with several school officials (including administrators teachers and counselors) a representative of Syntero and parents whose children have used these services. Our schools in partnership with Syntero provide numerous forms of support to the K-8 community to ensure that student needs are met.  These include early intervention efforts to increase awareness about mental health so that students can understand these issues and when and how to seek help. Such activities are essential to building a more welcoming culture around mental health. Our students need to know that it is ok to not always feel ok and that they wont be stigmatized if they reach out.  Further we offer support services on demand. Sometimes kids are struggling because a parent has been deployed and they miss them terribly to the point that they cant focus at school. Sometimes its that a grandparent has passed and its their first time losing a loved one. Sometimes its anxiety around academics or social issues or something else. Not every student needs additional support but when they do its critical that we have a caring environment in place not one that forces them to internalize instead of reaching out.  And of course there are crisis services. Even young children can go through crises and if our schools arent equipped with experts who know how to respond when they happen trauma can occur.  Is everything perfect? Certainly not. We need to find more creative ways to reach younger children in terms they understand. We have to keep up with needs in the face of a rapidly growing student population. And we must continually improve our processes and communication especially in the handoff from 8th grade to high school and in our discussions with parents. We can and should strive to get better and constructive feedback should always be accepted.  What we cant do though is baselessly question the motivations of dedicated mental health professionals which can chill people from seeking help and stigmatize these issues. If elected I will tirelessly promote a positive culture of mental health awareness and support dispel misinformation and ensure our students teachers and staff have the resources they need. The stakes are too high to do anything less.,political,Facebook
When my children were young I had to close my small business and stop working for a number of years because the costs of childcare actually made it too expensive to work. It's an absurd situation faced by far too many parents.

A universal paid family leave policy leave would create a better environment for businesses parents and children.,political,Facebook

Tell us a little about yourself.  My name is Mariah Hines I am a stay at home mom in Breezy Point with two wonderful kids who are just entering the school system. My family and I just moved here in April from Virginia Beach Virginia. I grew up in Arizona moved to New York and then Virginia with my husband Keagan. After we had children we were really looking for somewhere we felt comfortable raising our children and that is the main reason we are now here in Breezy Point MN.  Why are you interested in serving on the school board?  Having lived all around the country and having family in different areas of the country I have seen things that are being implemented into our schools that is concerning. More and more politics are being integrated into our school curriculum. School boards as well as schools themselves are non partisan organizations and should remain so. I am interested in serving on the school board so that I can maintain the integrity of our schools and keep politics out of the classrooms for my children and the children in our community.  What challenges does the Pequot Lakes district face and what are your recommendations for improvement?  Pequot Lakes is a great school district. I think it is less of an issue within our school district and more of an issue in the school districts across the country. Schools are becoming politicized and not the nonpartisan institutes they are meant to be. I simply want to maintain the integrity of our school district and keep politics away from our childrens education. I intend to remain nonpartisan when it comes to school board issues. I want to hear from the other residents students and parents. Like any elected official I want to be there to represent what the community wants not what I myself wants necessarily. I want to hold meetings and forums to stay informed on what the community wants to see and vote according to those results.  Why should families choose to send their children to Pequot Lakes Public Schools?  I know a lot of people in this area have grown up here but having lived all over I can tell you Pequot Lakes Public Schools is one of the best public school systems I have found. My husband and I spent hours researching schools across the country trying to find a school system we felt could give our children a similar childhood to our own. We left our home of 6 years in Virginia Beach and moved across the country with two young children just who we could enroll them in Pequot Lakes Public Schools. Between the small town atmosphere the caring teachers and the well kept facilities we know our children are very lucky.  What other thoughts would you like to share?  I know I havent lived in the community for long but we feel at home here. We feel that we have found an environment that we are proud to raise a family in. My interests are with my children and my community. I dont want to be sitting on the sidelines disagreeing with things that might happen and impact my community. I want to be able to make a difference and make sure not only my voice is heard but the voice of the community as well.,political,Facebook
So much of crummy politics is explained by our susceptibility to propaganda.  Our defenses to propaganda aren't natural: We have to build them.  Lots of those defenses are institutional like real-time fact-checking or limiting the use of bots on social media.  But they're also personal.  Modern propaganda techniques have evolved so quickly that our personal defenses have not caught up.  Until recently we had never been subjected to an environment in which media social media and elected officials could form a solid circle of misinformation.  If you get pulled into that circle you will experience constant reinforcement from each of those sources that will tell you to believe the others and reject all else.  And it will feel incredibly natural. That's how we form beliefs. We look for validation.  Once you're in that circle the circle can be moved in any almost direction.  You might encounter the occasional relative or co-worker who provides a counter-narrative but they're hopelessly outmatched compared to the level of belief validation you're getting from the circle.  Strengthening our personal defenses to propaganda involves the deliberate inclusion of contrary viewpoints *from sources we regard as credible.*  This is not the same as forcing ourselves to hate-watch the other side's propaganda. That just reinforces our circle.  But even if we don't go that far taking minimal steps - like simply getting a digital subscription *to an actual newspaper* instead of relying solely on ad-supported newsy websites that may be incentivized to link up to a circle - will significantly strengthen your defenses.  And elected officials who very much do not want to participate in propaganda bear special responsibilities:  - Use your platform to actively undercut propaganda by pushing out credible information.  - Act in good faith.  - Don't speak as if you and your allies possess all the truth.  There is no question that we are going to strengthen our defenses to modern propaganda.  The question is how quickly we can do it and whether new techniques will continue to outpace us.  My biggest cause for optimism is new generations that are growing up exposed to exponentially more information than any generation in human history.  My hope is that this will be an extinction-level event for politicians who exist simply to engage in crass manipulation. But it may not.  Until then as a country we are much more vulnerable to this kind of attack than we'd care to admit.  And its impact likely exceeds other pernicious forces like gerrymandering or a corrupt campaign finance system.  So we should learn to speak to it directly.  - Sen. Jeff Jackson,political,Facebook

"Making Art in the Land of Philistines  The other day when the creative fit was upon me I determined to compose a somewhat whimsical poem in praise of Abraham the Father of Many and his nonresistant qualities. I had artistic phantoms whirling like dervishes in my head and I needed to exorcise them. I cracked my knuckles hitched my chair closer to the keyboard and began typing. This is what came out:  Now Abra'm had sheeps and hosses galore and Lot had a lot - but he wanted more. And the har'd hands was scrappin' and fightin' like h--- fer the rights to the water from Abrahams well.  Now if the reader will kindly cast his or her eye over the preceding lines aside from the rather regrettable language the narrator WILL use a few things become more or less glaringly obvious. Number one; Keats it ain't.  Number two it had begun to dawn on me that it wasn't the great patriarch Abraham who dug the wells which fell into such sharp dispute but his estimable progeny Isaac. I WAS CONFLATING TWO STORIES.  At this critical juncture my wife walked in and peered over my shoulder. She KNOWS how I resent it when she does that. I was ashamed and covered the nakedness of my unfinished work with my hands over the keyboard but she outsmarted me by looking at what I'd already written on the screen. ""What on earth are you using language like THAT for?"" she queried severely. (I winced in pain at the misplaced preposition.)  Suddenly and for the first time with understanding I felt like Aaron standing before the fierce wrath of Moses with a golden calf to explain away. One doesn't always have complete control of one's characters after all.  ""I..I..I. I was just putting the words in and this is what came out."" I stammered. ""I wasn't sure exactly where it was going.""  It sounded every bit as lame as Aaron's excuses had in millennia past.  What hope does creative inspiration have to succeed I ask you being surrounded by farmer's daughters of ruthless practicality (regardless of how fetching) and an environment of cold pragmatism and negativity? What hope forsooth?  None at all of course.  I tried in vain to resurrect. I feverishly wrote more verses. They all failed bitterly. The juice was gone. Inspiration had fled.  I once read that the immortal Leonard Cohen wrote 43 verses to his majestic hymne du noir ""Halleluiah"" over the span of several days and then picked the best ones to record. Well Leonard Cohen wasn't subjected to the kind of disdain that I endure around here. That I can guarantee you.  So I will never stand on the poet's podium whilst the Star-Spangled Banner plays. When others declaim their ""breathes there a man..?"" and their ""Out of the night that covers me...!"" Or ""I never saw a purple cow...""

Hello everyone we need to talk about voter fraud and intimidation. I have had a lot of contact from deputies at Kootenai County Sheriffs Office (KCSO) concerning harassment at work. Voting against Bob Norris and the PAC will add yet another point of tension in an already stressed work environment. I hope we all realize that the Kootenai County Deputies Association is not an association for our deputies. They are a registered Political Action Committee (PAC) a big money special interest group. They have so much influence over our deputies that team Norris wants someone from this special interest group on review boards for our public employees. The employees that have contacted me are concerned that if they want to vote against PAC their votes can be looked up and the PAC and KCSO leadership will retaliate against them. Politics dont belong in the Sheriffs Office. Mike Bauer and I have spoken about and agree on that point. Add this to the widespread corruption at KCSO to the backs of our Deputies and its no wonder they leave to more pay. If you had a bad work environment wouldnt you want more pay?,political,Facebook
A Hard Fought Victory for Our Environment  The tabling of the ordinance to lease the Old Atlanta Prison Farm is a surprising and substantive victory for all those who have lobbied against it.  Considering I have been in the fight to preserve this area since before the Blackhall debacle it feels personally satisfying to just get a win. Its not a permanent victory though we only have a few more weeks to turn the tide.  There are only two council members who have come out publicly against this plan and six more who were concerned about the process. I want everyone to come together to find ways to firm up these six council members in the next few weeks or flip an opponent.  Politicians respond to pressure the tabling vote confirms this.  Council will respond to the voice of the people when it becomes too loud to ignore. Do not waver do not rest this is the most pivotal two weeks in this campaign to save the largest undisturbed green space inside the perimeter.

"CLIMATE URGENCY:  The most pressing environmental concern for Maine is the impact of global warming and the climate crisis our planet is facing in the near future. Rising global temperatures are going to impact our environment and economy in many ways. We are on the precipice of whether we can scale back the impact of humanity on the planet's climate and we must act IMMEDIATELY if we are to prevent catastrophic global climate change.  The impact of climate change on Maine cannot be overstated. Soil erosion will make a hugely devastating impact on our state if global temperatures rise. We will see more major storms and high-level hurricanes -- stronger storms and more frequent. Billions of dollars worth of property will be destroyed in the coming decades; significant areas of our current coastline will erode and become part of the ocean.  Everything will be affected by climate change not only the natural environment but human constructs and social structures including the economy.  The philosophy that holds the environment and the economy to be in conflict with each other is a misguided farce. It is only major corporations with very specific self-serving interests who posit that the economy and environment are in conflict with each other.  The health of the environment is directly related to the economy especially here in Maine where the super-majority of our state's revenue is directly related to ecological tourism and environmentally based industries.  It is our national and state parks lakes oceans woods and mountains that stimulate the economy here -- by attracting people to fish hunt hike bird watch snowmobile ski swim boat; by providing a bounty of natural resources to support agricultural and forest industries that yield paper products blueberries potatoes fisheries and more.  Without a healthy environment in Maine we have nothing to subside on.  Therefore ultimately there are two immediately pressing environmental concerns that are tied together: climate change and the capacity of human culture to adapt (and adapt QUICKLY) to address the infrastructural transformations needed to meet the challenge of climate change.  While it may be obvious that climate change is the single most environmental issue affecting Maine the deeper question is ""Do we have the capacity to change society to address the issue?""  The solutions are all readily available. Science has given us a multitude of solutions to immediately combat climate change. The only thing holding back is the political will to start TODAY to implement the solutions we know can reverse our current climate trajectory. The biggest obstacle is political will. Time and time again the major political parties have proven that they do not have the foresight or ability to take initiative swiftly enough to make a difference before it is too late.

Governor Cooper released his proposed budget for the next two years. This proposal presents an extraordinary opportunity to invest in a pandemic recovery that will benefit all corners and people of our state. It helps schools and children increases access to healthcare enhances protection for clean air and water invests in clean energy and invests massively in infrastructure. All of this will bring many new good jobs to NC. It would also almost double our state's savings. Here are some highlights (the link below is to the budget slides with more detail):  Education  Provides K-12 teachers 10% raises on average over the biennium and ensures all noncertified school personnel receive a minimum of $15/hour.  Invests more than $78 million in early education and child development.  Provides $80 million to help school districts hire more nurses counselors psychologists and social workers to support student physical and mental health.  Jobs and Infrastructure  Leverages available state funds as well as the states share of funds from the federal American Rescue Plan Act (ARP) which is expected to provide North Carolina over $15 billion in aid.  Invests to help small businesses thrive and provides funding to prepare rural and economically distressed communities for an innovation-based economy.  Proposes funding to address the disproportionate economic impact of COVID-19 on communities of color through increased support for minority-owned businesses.  Takes advantage of the states low debt and historically low interest rates and recommends placing a $4.7 billion General Obligation Bond on the November 2021 ballot to ask voters to address key infrastructure needs  Access to quality healthcare. It is time to expand Medicaid.  Expands Medicaid to provide access to health care for more than 600000 working North Carolinians keeping rural hospitals open and strong reducing the number of uninsured veterans helping fight the opioid epidemic and injecting over $5 billion in direct investment into the state by expanding Medicaid.  The American Rescue Plan provides an additional $1.7 billion in federal funds to support Medicaid expansion without the state covering any cost share for up to six years.  Clean Energy and a clean environment.  Invests over $100 million in expanding access to clean energy technologies investing in clean energy economic development and building the clean energy workforce pipeline to catalyze North Carolinas economy. Invests $10 million for clean energy economic development and $4.5 million in clean energy grants for homegrown start-ups and small businesses.  Clean safe water and air are essential for the health and well-being of North Carolinians. Includes more than $3.8 million each year for emerging compounds mitigation.  A safer more equitable North Carolina.  The COVID-19 pandemic continues to shine a light on long-standing inequities.

For Immediate Release: Our Response To President Bidens Visit to Idaho.  Mr. President We hope you enjoyed your time in Idaho this week. It must be a good feeling to get out of Washington DC. Unfortunately we were not able to connect while you were here. If we had been able to meet there are a few topics we would have discussed:  As with all things in life there are areas you can directly control those you influence and others you have no control over. As President there are clear boundaries about what you can control. As the 10th amendment says you can only do what is explicitly called out in the Constitution. Everything else must be done by influence. The Legislative branch has the ability to create laws but you do not. EVERYTHING else is owned by the states or individuals.  Over the past nine months of your presidency you have consistently overstepped your authority with states rights. Here in Idaho we believe in self-reliance and independence. Idahoans know what is best for Idaho - not you.  In addition the policies you have enacted are negatively impacting the next generation of Americans that we represent:  - Most small businesses are owned by the under 40 group. Increased regulation tax increases and mandates are suffocating small businesses. Thousands have closed their doors.  - Inconsistencies in your COVID communication is causing confusion and mistrust. Decisions on schools impact our children. Parents are trying to juggle careers with potentially having to stay home due to closures. Vaccine mandates risk the jobs for many young professionals. The federal government has no place in requiring private citizens or businesses to be vaccinated. You have violated your promise to never mandate vaccines when you campaigned. It also sets precedent for a scary future. You are not exhibiting leadership. It is coercion.  - The rising inflation is hitting Americans at a time without much discretionary spending available. Inflation is the highest since the 1970s. Home prices are the highest in history. Gas prices are averaging $2 per gallon HIGHER than just 10 months ago. While it may appear great to have a wage increase in jobs it doesnt matter if the cost increase is higher to do business. Those costs are passed down to consumers or businesses stop hiring as many people.  - Your unwillingness to address crime and homelessness in the country is impacting Idaho. Look at Seattle Chicago New York Portland. Do you really believe things are going well there? We have thousands of people from these states fleeing into Idaho because of the failed policies there. This is placing tremendous pressure on Idaho infrastructure land and energy use and more.  - A really in-depth conversation is needed about your foreign and military policy. We are very disappointed in your handling of Afghanistan to put it politely. The mismanagement cost the lives of young Americans.  - You came to discuss wildfires in Idaho but it turned into statements about global warming. While we all agree in being good stewards of the environment you neglected to the discuss the mismanagement of federal lands that make up about 70% of Idaho. This increases the likelihood of devastating forest fires.  Overall if you look at many of the nations key performance indicators almost all of them are trending worse than just one year ago. You must recognize this. Your poll numbers are lower and decreasing faster than any President during their first year in office.  Please recognize that we arent seeking to condemn. We genuinely want to help. You are the President currently. If you fail America fails. Please let us know if you have time to discuss further. Wed be happy to meet with you.  Oh one last thing It seems like every time you try to take questions your microphone stops working. Wed be happy to buy you a megaphone so you dont run into these technical issues anymore.  Sincerely Idaho Young Republicans    #idpol #idleg,political,Facebook
The need for a Monarchy in Afghanistan.  Afghanistan used to be a Kingdom even before Islam. During the Islamic Khelafat or time of the Khuafae Rashidun Afghanistan though accepted Islam as the new religion but it was in constant war with the Arabs and rejecting to be a province of the Khelafat but to have its own kind of self-rule the Padshahi (Persian word for Monarchy).  After the end of the Islamic Khelafat Afghanistan sooner turned back to its roots again and became a monarchy. At the height of the Ottoman Empire which ruled most of the Islamic world Afghanistan proved itself to be a sovereign kingdom not part of the Ausmani Khelafat of the modern day Turkey.  When the very name of the modern country Afghanistan was introduced and the first Afghan empire was established the land remained a Kingdom again as its predecessors Kingdom of Ariana etc. Although the country had ups and downs in terms of governance territorial integrity but the people still called their timely leaders Kings even whose territory was limited to few square miles even its a norm today that people prefer to use the word king for the president .  This shows the Afghan spirit of having a country under the name which they love and respect the Pachahi (Pashto word). Although the region had turmoils because of the aggression from the outside world super powers but these were short as the people of Afghanistan United to combat a military takeover from overseas but the source of conflict got worse when the mainstream system of the governance the Monarchy was overthrown from inside by introducing a new way of ruling the land and people through a republic coup and Afghanistans lucky days became shortened. This had two problems dividing the people inside creating a chaos and struggling for power grabbing and self-care meanwhile making it easier for outside intervention from the East and West blocks of the world the result being that Afghanistan had to fight its neighbors for its survival or fight East against the West or vice-versa.  The coming of the Taliban which helped nothing more visible than protecting the territorial integrity of the country and holding together the different ethnic groups in one mass in an environment of fear and miscommunication and harsh style of Islam the cultural Islamic country had seen. Another problem of the Taliban was the introduction of the Emirate where the Amir was never in the capital of the Emirate creating a two-folded system of control of that of Kandahar and Kabul. Although the rule of law was harsh it benefited any kind of crime such as child abuse rubbery and the use of the narcotics.  The current day problems of Afghanistan are two-folded  those inside the so called Republic and the ones created by the fighting between Emirate and Republic. The inside story of the Republic which is very clear from its outset getting full power and controllingeliminating the rest of the imagery power pockets both political and social which had a devastating impact on the very human right the struggle for survival making it easier to destroy the society as well as creating a loophole for foreign intervention which got legitimacy at the end of the day because those who had fled the country in the first place was to breath and survive this existed from the time of Dawod to the second term of Ashraf Ghana.  Any leader or Political parties who wanted to get to the top and never had such a background to be accountable to any one especially the leader of the party tried even to start the system of Andiwali ( honest and dishonest friends) inside one political party to weaken and disengage the rest from power which reached to the level of tribe and ones clan. A further issue of the republic was appointing in the police and military services you never knew what happened if you appointed a less trustworthy person  you either ran the risk of a full blown coup in the ranks of the government but if you appointed a trusted one he could kill you in your bed.  Currently the problems of the republic of Afghanistan are the same (government control areas) but of course another headache the Taliban and Emirate who are battling for more soil control and a psychological war against each other. These two groups will never trust each other and of course one joining the other in a peace settlement would be considered a surrender to the other and obviously a problem of the future when it comes to the relationship of the rulers and those being governed. Another issue is that the most influential parties who might get the power had a military violence history against the others and in the absence of a Mashar (King) will repeat the experience of golden opportunity time the elimination of each other. Therefore I believe there is a need for the monarchy system in Afghanistan to hold and control the responsible ruling person or party not to abuse power against the rest of the parties or the nation . A further advantage of the monarchy is that it is a middle ground between the current position of the government as well as the Taliban and both will accept it rather than the victims of one another ego .  Besides the internal stability the Monarchy not only creates trust in the people in terms of being a familiar system of governance it also helps for the regional balance with neighbors. Every neighbors of Afghanistan is worried what will happen to them from Afghanistan after for example 4-5 years when the election is over or what will happen to the people of their ethnicity in Afghanistan therefore interfering and considering interference their rights.  The existence of a monarchy ensures the balance of trust between Afghanistan and its neighbors each other trying for mutual cooperation and the longevity of a peaceful status quo thus respecting each others sovereignty and territorial integrity. In Afghan culture the elder of a family plays the role of a mediator when there is any issue and the monarch can play a very vital role by mediation among all ethnic groups when needed especially in the case of a constitutional monarchy where the monarch has no reason for power grabbing by using one ethnic group against the other therefore strengthening national unity and enthusing confidence in people avoiding and stopping fear from any unknown future government and ruling situation.  As Afghanistan is an Islamic country the name of the Islamic kingdom of Afghanistan will be accepted and loved by many . It will also ensure from a Muslim religious perspective that the head of the country is Muslim and male.  Since certain terminologies are not welcome in Afghanistan such as Mashrota (considered conditional rather constitutional) and people are eager for using their votes too therefore a new system of monarchy (Direct Monarchy ) with electing the prime minister through direct votes will be welcomed by the nation in decision making it will also make it legitimate to vote from an Islamic perspective too since the real leader is considered a king both male and Muslim from an Islamic point of view and the votes can be used for a second person from Islamic perspective even if it is a female therefore accepted by even the Taliban and other religious circles. A direct monarchy system not only helps in terms of people decisions it also creates transparency and accountability since the prime minister can be asked by the parliament to directly answer any questions to give full account of his terms in relation to his cabinet as well as governors code of conduct which is absent in the current republic system of Afghanistan. If the monarch is given the power of being commander in chief of the country or head of the army hence Royal army this will ensure that the king is responsible for looking after the territorial integrity of the country as well as avoid any coup against the Kingdom by the ruling government and create trust and stability. This will also reduce the risk of harsh nationalism mostly created by ruling parties for promising voters and people for foreign gains. Since the monarchy is sovereign therefore all foreign forces should leave the country as well this will not only ensure national pride in the people but also avoid regional and international rivalries on Afghan soil.,political,Facebook

Hi all! SB 84 Community Solar is scheduled in House Energy Environment and Natural Resource Committee TOMORROW! We need to make sure that amendments being made don't undermine the purpose of the bill so please call and email the committee members.  Here is what we need to fix: 1. Get rid of the addition of utility ownership. The point is to diversify not expand monopoly control 2. Get rid of the restriction on who can be a subscriber - cities counties and large businesses are great customers for community solar and have been working to create community solar - they shouldn't be excluded 3. Public Regulation Commission oversight is important to regulate monopoly utilities but isn't necessary for a voluntary market based program. We don't need red tape that'll make it impossible for the little guys to pursue this 4. The utilities shouldn't be able to challenge any proposal they want. Since they get to recover their legal costs by billing ratepayers they do not mind tying things up in legal challenges but that could mean prohibitive costs for solar developers. The utilities will use and abuse this measure to prevent projects.  Heres who to call/email:  Matthew McQueen (chair) (505) 986-4423 matthew.mcqueen@nmlegis.gov  Melanie A.

EMERGENCY IN THE HEAVENS by Arthur Firstenberg  Early on October 6 2020 at 5:29 a.m. Mountain Time SpaceX launched another 60 satellites to join their fellows racing through the ionized layer of air that protects us and gives us life. At about that time a good friend of mine here in Santa Fe was awakened by a severe nosebleed. That evening I told the grocery clerk at the checkout counter that I was feeling unusually tired. So am I he said.  There are now 738 satellites operating in the Starlink constellation. Except for what they can do for us -- connect us faster and faster with billions of people and machines -- everyone pretends that they are not there that we can continue to punch holes in the air with impunity burn prodigious amounts of fossil fuels fill up the stratosphere with black soot litter the night sky with moving lights and alter the invisible electric field that connects us with the sun and stars and circulates through our bodies from birth until death.  In recent weeks on the coast of Australia record numbers of whales committed suicide by beaching themselves. In Botswana hundreds of elephants suddenly collapsed and died. Here in the southwest from Nebraska to Colorado to Texas New Mexico and Arizona to northern Mexico millions of migrating birds have fallen dead out of the sky emaciated starved to death because there are no insects to eat.  Our house is burning down and no firefighters come. The source of the flames is unacknowledged unseen. It is there in the air speeding from phone to phone antenna to antenna satellite to satellite filling atmosphere earth and seas penetrating bones and disrupting nerves of every animal bird insect and tree.  And it is not because we are horrible people. It is not because of a conspiracy to destroy the world. It is because the phones in our hands demand it. On April 11 1862 Henry Brooks Adams grandson of the sixth American president wrote I firmly believe that before many centuries more science will be the master of man. The engines he will have invented will be beyond his strength to control. Someday science may have the existence of mankind in its power and the human race commit suicide by blowing up the world.  That day is here. It is up to us to put out the fire not just to protest and march and blame other people. We cannot stop the earth from burning down until we stop shooting flames from our fingers wherever we go. It is the people without cell phones who are going to lead the new environmental movement to lead the way to a sustainable future.  Other technologies pollute inadvertently. Pesticides are intended to kill pests; the fact that they escape into the general environment is unintentional. Nuclear waste is not intended to go everywhere. Plastics are not intended to end up in the ocean. But with cell phones the pollutant -- radiation -- is the product. Cell phones cannot work unless every square inch of the environment is irradiated. Once this becomes acceptable nature is no longer of value.  This newsletter will be devoted to two of the engines of science that are beyond our strength to control that have the existence of the world in their power: cell phones and plastics -- unless we wake up and stop using them.  ITS NOT LIKE WE DIDNT KNOW  If Neil Armstrong had brought a cell phone to the moon in 1969 it would have appeared from earth at night to be the brightest object in the universe in the microwave spectrum. In the daytime the sun would have been brighter but at night the cell phone would have outshone every star.  There is a reason cell phones are outlawed in Green Bank West Virginia home of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory: even a single cell phone even from miles away would blind the radio astronomers there and make it impossible for them to see the stars. Astronomers measure radio waves in units called janskys. A typical star shines at 10 to 100 janskys. The Sun shines at about 500000 janskys. When you hold a cell phone against your head you are pumping energy at the rate of about 100000000000000000 janskys into your brain.[1]  If we are going to save this planet we have to be able to think and reason. And we have known since 1975 that microwave radiation damages the brain. In that year Allan Frey published his ground-breaking article Neural function and behavior: defining the relationship.[2] In a study on rats he found that low-level microwaves -- one hundred times lower than what peoples brains are exposed to from their cell phones today -- damage the blood-brain barrier. This is the anatomical barrier that keeps toxic chemicals bacteria and viruses in your blood from entering your brain. It is also the barrier that maintains the inside of your head at a constant pressure and prevents you from having a stroke.  At least twenty laboratories in many countries confirmed Freys work over the years. Finally in 2003 neurosurgeon Leif Salford at Lund University in Sweden proved the obvious: that disrupting the blood-brain barrier causes brain damage. He exposed rats to a cell phone once for two hours at very low power and sacrificed them fifty days later. Two percent of the exposed rats brain cells were damaged or destroyed.[3] He later exposed rats to a cell phone again at very low power for two hours once a week for a year and found that they were cognitively impaired.[4]  And in 2020 a study has been published showing that the same thing happens in humans. A team of scientists at Heidelberg University in Germany used MRIs to examine the brains of 48 young adults between the ages of 18 and 30. They found that the more hours per day their subjects habitually spent on their smartphones the less gray matter they had in their brains and the less brain activity was detected.[5]   CELLPHONETASKFORCE.ORG www.cellphonetaskforce.org,political,Facebook
"WAGES vs. INFLATION  So here we go with all of the inflation talk again; one could see it coming from the planet Pluto. Capitalism in the current environment is apparently incapable of providing real wage gains to workers. Wage gains currently reflected in increased unemployment benefits and one time transfers have shrunk the pool of available workers enabling available workers to demand higher wages.  Wage gains create inflationary pressures and the Federal Reserve's job is to maintain price stability--roughly defined at a 2% inflation target. If the rate exceeds this for a period of time the Nation's central bank the Federal Reserve (FED) will target higher interest rates effectively reducing the Nation's money supply in order to diminish both employment and wage demands.  The Federal Reserve (FED) has determined itself to run inflation a little hot above the 2% rate for a while and justifies this for having been unable to achieve its 2% inflation target for most years since the Great Financial Crisis. But a 4.2% annual inflation rate measure for the last monthly period has many analysts speculating the FED will tighten sooner then it had expected. Either way interest rates are going up; either the inflation component of the rate will rise or if the FED tightens the real component of the rate will rise. Higher interest rates mean lower asset asset values.  The general consensus in the markets is that inflation is bad so the FED while it will initially be patient with an inflation rate which exceeds 2% will quickly move to higher rates when it deems inflation a credible threat to longer term financial stability.  The whole point of this process is to slow down the economy in order to reduce employment and wage increase demands. So as stated above a capitalist economy is incapable of providing wage gains. This leaves the worker where the worker has often resided during the past decades in a weekly struggle to maintain housing utilities adequate healthy food and adequate healthcare. Not much has changed.  Is there a way out of this daily struggle for decent existence among the working class? The management class will say yes; productivity gains will enable working class advancement. In another era perhaps this was true; but this has proven false in a world of abundant labor and increased technological takeover of many human jobs. There is an excess of global labor so capital will either flee elsewhere in the face of wage gains and if not flee elsewhere capital will replace the worker with technology or a machine. Consequently the worker is left in a diminished job market with diminished market value.  Wages which equal market value is the problem. Imagine a world where technology leaves half of the world unemployed. What kind of wage will an additional worker to the labor force be able to demand? This is their market value. There must be a recognition that ""subsidies"" are necessary for workers to live a decent life. Subsidies are put in quotes here because subsidies are a very accounting specific measurement. Current accounting measures do not measure broader public gains and losses due to economic activity they measure only gains and losses specific to the private firm or to other corporate bodies. This aside if operating in an inflationary market this subsidy to the worker must represent a transfer of consumption from the upper classes to the lower classes in order to relieve inflationary pressure on production capacities.  This is why we should get nervous over union wage demands. It's not that their demands are not justified they are justified but their strategy for wage gains is very short term cannot last and fails to recognize that capitalism itself based on accounting measures of profits and inflation is incapable of advancing the material requirements of it's working class population.  Capitalism accounting does not account for the value added to a nation through a fully employed and well-educated populace. Both full employment and enhanced educational investment create short term inflationary pressures which lead to fears of an inflationary cycle. Consequently the two things which would advance the working class position: full employment which drives up wage rates and a good education which will advance future earnings are denied to them in order to prevent inflationary pressure.  It is all very structural and the system has little choice but to react in the manner in which it does in order to protect the private firm's balance sheet i.e. in order to avoid default. The tightening is painful for the firm but necessary in order to preserve the system with some level of stability.  Unions would be more effective if they united in a joint force and organized nonunion workers to join them in a mass political movement which demanded national economic policies which will actually improve workers' long term positions.  If wage gains produce inflation which forces the FED to take action which reverses those wage gains then this is a recognition that there is undue pressure on productive capacity. The FED policy makers and other analysts are correct that pressure on these facilities must be relieved in order to reduce inflationary pressures but labor needs to demand that the management class look elsewhere to relieve this pressure. Where elsewhere to look? At those who already consume too much. Why should struggling workers sacrifice their meager consumption in order to deflate inflationary pressures? It would be better to limit consumption among the well-off who already consume too much.  This transfer of consumption from the well-off to the unwell-off is most easily achieved through higher progressive tax rates. Lest we forget all was reasonably well when ""The top marginal tax rate in 1960 was 91% which applied to income over $200000 (for single filers) or $400000 (for married filers)  thresholds which correspond to approximately $1.5 million and $3 million respectively in today's dollars."" (). These higher progressive tax rates eliminated much of the excessive consumption which we see today freeing up resources for greater consumption among favored groups within the working class.  Meanwhile all the hope that the numerous labor disturbances across the globe will generate lasting advances for labor should be set aside. Under the current system with current accounting measures the world's central banks are forced to limit even reverse gains made by the working classes. Broader structural change is needed to serve working class needs. A transfer of consumption from the overconsuming portion of the population to the under consuming portions of the population will relieve pressure on productive capacity to allow greater consumption among the working class in a non-inflationary manner.",political,Facebook
Friends I am asking for your vote to remain on the Tomball ISD School Board because I believe. I believe in community. I believe in family. I believe in tomorrow. And I believe in progress and the human spirit. It is clear in my mind that the intersection of these personal beliefs is education and the future success of our society will be influenced by the investments and decisions we make today.  I live in the district with my wife Avery our two young daughters Rowan and Ellis and our dog Rocket. My career brought us to Texas but the great schools and small town feel brought us to Tomball ISD.  In my free time I love to read and always have. I enjoy reading about history believing there is tremendous value in learning from our past. We should strive to learn from our mistakes not repeat them. I also enjoy traveling with my family. I love visiting our National Parks and real-life places featured in fiction and non-fiction books. My favorite so far was sleeping in a covered wagon on the open prairie just like Laura from Little House on the Prairie.  I have been employed with ExxonMobil for over half of my life beginning when I was 18 years old. It all started at a Mobil service station in my hometown where I accepted a job running a cash register making coffee and cleaning bathrooms. I needed a job and this was one I could walk to from my mother's house. For the next 3 years I worked every weekend and every holiday anywhere I was needed and could help.  Now some 20 years later my professional record will show continual and exceptional growth in a highly competitive and diverse environment across a variety of roles and with increasing levels of responsibility. I have been raised to practice the bedrock fundamentals of ExxonMobil with regards to safety environment controls ethics and financial discipline. It has become a way of life.  My current role is within the Chemicals division as the Global Synthetics Alliance & Revenue Manager. Everyday we are making products that put airplanes in the air keep people and goods moving efficiently and run the machines which are critical to society from hospitals and power plants to the humble school bus. Much like the public school system I am not sure consumers are fully aware of the effort and passion which is required to deliver every time without failure. But yet it is the passion which carries us onward.  Read below for more and thank you for your support!  Justin Unser TISD School Board Trustee,political,Facebook

What do you get when voting for Kenneth Speicher Dear Neighbor and Fellow Citizen of Columbia Township: The most important decision for selecting a candidate is knowing what you are going to get in return. As a property owner and resident of Columbia Township for many years I cherish the rural character of the Township and the goodwill of the residents of the community. Since moving to Columbia Township in 1994 I have witnessed many forms of wrong-doing bias cronyism and nepotism within Columbia Township government as well as violations of laws enacted by the Michigan Legislature meant to protect the rights of citizens to open and transparent government. Most of the unacceptable behavior and actions of Columbia Township Officials have been violations of laws such as:  State of Michigan Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)  violations denying access to public records. The FOIA guarantees you and every citizen timely access to public records.  State of Michigan Open Meeting Act (OMA)  violations denying public witnessing of and participation in government official decision-making. The OMA guarantees your knowledge of knowing how and for what reason government makes decisions on your behalf.  State of Michigan Planning Enabling Act and State of Michigan Zoning Enabling Act  violations denying the protection of your property values and a stable growth pattern for the different District of Land  it guarantees no spot zoning will occur in your neighborhood it also requires comprehensive surveys and studies prior to changes in land uses in the land area you live in. Knowing these statutes and how they protect a property owners constitutional rights to a proper hearing where you can voice your opinion about making changes to the land uses in your area can be easily overlooked by a person who is running for office just to get elected. On several occasions I have sought legal recourse and remedy for such law violations and behavior by Columbia Township officials in the courts including Van Buren County Circuit Court the Michigan Court of Appeals and the Michigan Supreme Court. Every time prior to filing litigation Columbia Township Officials were given the opportunity to take corrective actions and have refused to do so. The last thing I want to do is litigation. The township officials want litigation. It is important for you to know; the law only allows the Judge to refunded my actual or reasonable attorney fees when the Township violates the law. I do not personally gain financially not one penny. My critics will tell you I personally gained financially from my prevailing court decision. My response is there would be no litigation and payment of attorney fees if the township merely followed the law. What is in this for you  I have been attending the township board meetings for many years and I have been voicing my opinion on common character land uses in the districts and the requirement for comprehensive surveys and studies and it seems the officials want to make that decision under their police powers for public health and safety without them understanding what public health and safety means. You are entitled to having notice to a hearing where you can be heard by impartial individuals to get a fair and meaningful hearing. You have a right to have issues before the township placed on the ballot instead of five-board members making the decision for you. There is a reason the laws require a lot of deliberation and discussion before decisions are made in government. It is to force the right decision to be made. You lose the selection of the right decision when elected officials use their authority without notice and hearing. Do you think the citizens of the township should be able to vote on the following items or allow the Township elected officials make the decision for them? 1. Spending $430000 of Township Road Fund money generated for roads other than County Roads? The current township board made that decision for the first time ever to spend our local tax special assessment on a County Road. 2. These Township Board Members voted for huge increasing their wages and the wages of their deputies in April 2020 Election Candidate Linda Norton (Supervisor) Candidate Christy Case (Clerk) Election Candidate Rhonda Collins (Treasurer) and Election Candidate Beverly Sherrer (Trustee) 3. Changing the character of the agricultural district by allowing retail businesses as part of the agricultural area. (A farmer has the right to sell his produce products of his produce and engage in agritourism activities to draw customers to their farm market. It is allowed by the Right to Farm Act but there are restrictions to prevent a full blown retail business operation occurring at a farm market.) Is it time to say 'enough-is-enough' with the reckless decision-making of the Columbia Township Board -- decision-making that harms our environment and the quality of our rural way of life? Neighbors and fellow citizens of Columbia Township we have an opportunity to improve the rural character and good-will of the Columbia Township community. Your vote in the August 4 2020 Primary Election will determine how successful we will be in achieving such improved rural character and community good-will. Your vote matters! Your vote to support my candidacy as Supervisor of Columbia Township will greatly improve the likelihood of our success in making Columbia Township a good place to reside and raise a family. I possess the experience in Columbia Township government and industry (see the attached Brochure) and I believe success is a matter of leadership. I commit to you that if elected Supervisor I will put an end to the long standing wrong-doing bias cronyism nepotism and violation of laws within Columbia Township government. I commit to you that if I am elected Supervisor I will put you first and foremost and value your opinion and direction you seek for the future of our township. Thank you for your time in reading this letter.

In rural Missouri heath care services are spotty while accidents and injuries can be high. A total of 41 counties in Missouri dont have a hospital. Of the 68 hospitals that are located in rural communities many have very few beds. Most rural residents have to travel great distances for medical help. In rural Missouri where agricultural-related accidents happen often (700 reported in 2016 alone) that trip could make an injury more serious more permanent or even lead to death. Addressing these issues would require a multifaceted plan that includes access to better primary and preventative care a more stable economic environment and better equipped and resourced first responders. Broadband access overlaps with this issue as telehealth services have replaced regular visits to the doctor. No Missourians heath should be affected by their choice to live outside a city and Outstate MO is advocating to ensure they have as equal access to healthcare as those who live in the urban cities.,political,Facebook
I dont want to bore everyone with too many details but to those of you who may be interested I want to give a little more detail and history about how my version of the work program that I started was developed and implemented in Harrisburg.  Here are two facts that Harrisburg taxpayers need to know up front:  (1) Harrisburg Township is mandated by Illinois law to provide general assistance to its needy residents as are all Illinois townships. (2) Harrisburg Township was spending just under $ 1 Million per year on its General Assistance Program when I was first elected.  After I was first elected and took office I inherited a serious general assistance over spending problem at Harrisburg Township. Spending just under $ 1 Million per year was a disproportionate amount of money to spend for general assistance in a community our size.  But before I even decided to run for Supervisor and participate in the caucus process where the candidates are nominated I became aware of the general assistance overspending and spent some time thinking about how I might try to solve this issue if I were in charge. All of the recipients received their general assistance benefits each month with no obligations whatsoever to our community or to the taxpayers who were footing the bill for general assistance. I thought there has to be a better way to manage this.  I wanted to reduce the amount of money that was being spent on general assistance but at the same time I still wanted to continue to help the truly needy residents of our community. After a lot of thought on this subject I finally concluded that having the recipients work for their general assistance benefits by performing community work made a lot of sense for both the taxpayers and the recipients. A work program like I was thinking about had the potential of reducing the overspending by reducing the number of recipients on our general assistance rolls by giving them a push in the right direction into the real working world that the rest of us live in. We would accomplish a considerable amount of community work projects with the large recipient work force that we would have initially. The recipients would feel more like they were earning their assistance which would help their self-esteem. Putting together the community work sites would be a challenge. I would have to convince the possible sponsoring entities (City of Harrisburg Saline County Park District Housing Authority Hbg Twp Road District etc.) that it would be worth it to them with the free labor to accomplish work that they would never have the time or the work force to address otherwise. I also knew that I would need to assure them that I would handle any problem child situation that might emerge from those ranks whereas a recipient would try to resist the work program by being disruptive. Now having a work program concept that I felt good about I decided that I would venture out into the world of local politics and run for Supervisor to start a work program to correct the general assistance over spending problem along with tackling any other operational problems that I might find at the township along the way. I made a campaign promise to the taxpayers of Harrisburg Township during my campaign that I would start a general assistance work program if I were elected to the office of Harrisburg Township Supervisor.  After I was elected I had the ability to look into this problem deeper. I found that most of the general assistance recipients did not have a past working history. I was further convinced that the best solution was to start a work program. I felt (especially due to the job climate that existed at that time) that a large number of the recipients once exposed to a working environment would determine for themselves that getting off of general assistance and getting an actual real job would open their eyes to a whole new world that already existed for people who wanted to work and get their piece of the American dream. I would still extend a helping hand on behalf of our community to the recipients that remained on the general assistance rolls who truly needed the help and couldnt quite make the transition into the real world working environment. But I was hopeful that those numbers would be more in line with what they should be for a community our size.  While doing research on this subject I discovered that there was a past work program called workfare that had been used in the past in Illinois townships. This workfare concept although was not all that popular with the townships and had been dropped by a lot of Illinois townships who had made the decision to try to implement workfare because this concept was structurally flawed more difficult to manage put more operational burdens on the townships and wasnt really that effective in producing the desired results. So I determined that I needed to start from scratch and develop my own work program concept with different operational rules.  After I had developed my new work program concept into a detailed plan I contacted Glenn Poshard to ask for some help with my project. At that time Glenn Poshard was an Illinois State Senator and chairman of the then Illinois public aid committee. I met with Senator Poshard a few times to explain my version of a work program that I wanted to start in Harrisburg Township. Senator Poshard thought my work program was a good concept. He told me that he would help me accomplish my goal by getting approval for me to start my work program as a pilot program for Harrisburg Township. A few weeks later Senator Poshard contacted me to inform me that my pilot work program had been approved. I was finally very close to starting my work program in Harrisburg.  I had already gone through the plan with our general assistance staff and they were ready to implement the new work program procedures. Once I worked out the community work sites with our sponsors and we had all agreed on what we wanted to accomplish throughout our community by defining the different projects we set the work program into motion.  The policy of my work program basically states that a general assistance recipient has to perform community work to keep receiving general assistance benefits or be removed from the rolls with no benefits for a time period. After that time period had expired a recipient that had been removed from the rolls for failure to comply with the work program could reapply for benefits. If the recipient then complies with the work program the recipient continues to receive general assistance benefits. I demonstrated that my new work program concept could work in Harrisburg and accomplish benefits for both the taxpayers and the recipients.  (1) Our local governmental units used this work program labor to accomplish tasks that they could not afford otherwise. (2) The General Assistance recipients who had little or no working history were reintroduced into a working environment which helped many of them gain permanent employment. (3) General Assistance spending was cut. (4) The resulting reduction in the General Assistance rolls also decreased the office work load to a point that I streamlined our General Assistance office staff by more than 50% to match that reduced office work load which further cut spending. (5) The less fortunate of our community that remain on the rolls are still provided a helping hand (6) The end result was over a 90% reduction in our general assistance spending. This was a big success for the taxpayers and our community.  My work program has worked very well. The general assistance expenditures have been reduced from just under $ 1 Million per year down to $90000 per year. We have achieved over a 90% reduction in spending. After my work program had operated successfully for a while and started achieving the desired results thereby proving itself as a viable alternative my version of the work program became the new model for township work programs in Illinois. The success of my work program led to former State Senator and former Congressman Glenn Poshards public statement: I am strongly in support of this project. It will provide needed opportunities for general assistance recipients and thereby benefit taxpayers. It will help relieve some of the economic burden on the Township the County and the State.,political,Facebook
Whats Wrong With Our Eyesight?  Perception is the state of being or process of realizing something through the senses. It gives us the ability to discern what is a reality comprising substance and form against that which is a figment of objects familiar that have substance only to find out it was only a semblance of something familiar. We do this often realizing that what we see sometimes may indeed be not what we encounter.  Why then do we see on one hand the character of one person whom we mistrust because some have said they are untrustworthy and another person whose character reeks with all the evidence of no allegiance to truth in any form and we give our assent to them for what they say is for our own good only resulting in dangerous consequences for us and for those whom we claim to love.  The result: we hurl down the road not knowing if it will take us to where we desire only to discover too late that the road has a dead end with a concrete barrier that stopped us from moving ahead to where we were led.  The tragedy: on most roads under construction there are warning signs that show that the road is out and to make a detour yet we plow ahead ignoring the construction crews the earthmovers the huge ditches to wind upside down hurt or wounded.  Who are you still listening to? If their life is a road map a life of excesses with overwhelming stresses you cannot find relief. What's it worth?  What do you have to lose? Nothing but your life your rights hopes your dreams and the lives of innocents who have crossed paths in history with you.  When will you learn what you have between your ears? It's not just for wearing a hat. Let no one tell you what to think. Think for yourself.  Where are your senses taking you? What do you perceive on your horizon? Ground yourself in the truth and weed out the innuendos and suspicions that do not have proven facts and your integrity will be protected as well as your life.  How are you going to show your own thinking? Agreeing without investigating shows just how gullible we are and how easily we can be led anywhere. You wouldn't take the word log a used car person about a car for sale without looking it over and test driving it around outside of the car lot. Why would you give your Will over so easily without knowing what you are getting? That's what we do now. We let others do our thinking for us and we suffer the consequences.  We have no one to blame but ourselves.  We've been sold a bill of goods that has no value.  Take your receipts back and demand a refund.  1. Contact your Representative and Senator and ask what are they doing for you not on your behalf. Why? Because they will take your will and confirm it into their plan knowing that you will never know the difference. Require more of them than what they deliver. That's why we voted for them.  2. Seek to understand the position of others who you do not agree with. They have as much right to express their concerns peacefully as you do. If you cannot find a common ground upon which both can agree agree to disagree.  3. Seek to be a blessing than to be a thorn. The model still holds true that to do unto others as you would have them do unto you. should be our norm. No one should beat us doing this in our current environment.  4. Find a need and meet it without seeking to be praised. We or honored. It demonstrates genuineness rather than generosity.  5. Make your aim to heal in any circumstance and you will find out the true meaning of humility. You will find that for the grace of God go I.  6. Lower the volume of your discussions and you will be able to be heard. Loudness is only beneficial in a sports arena where everyone is yelling together for the same purpose: to cheer their team to victory.  7. Rise each morning with an appreciation that you have one more day to do something good with your life. Don't waste it on frivolous pursuits that will not stand the test of time. Most of the memorable people in history are remembered because of what they said and what they did. How will history remember you?  8. Start with number 1 again but take it up a notch.  See you next week ,political,Facebook

"In April the League of Women's Voters of Ann Arbor sent out a survey to local candidates on three questions - their third question was ""What are the most serious problems facing the township and how will you work to solve them?""  Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) Citations from State of Michigan EGLE  In January 2020 the township was cited for permit violations due to increased infiltration and inflow into the Waste Water Treatment collection system. During high storm water levels and winter thaw during the spring the plant experiences higher capacity to bypass unprotected waters into nearby streams. The State of Michigan EGLE notified the plant that our facility needs to resolve the discharge peak flows from the facility during higher water levels at the discharge points ensuring that our facility will not be bypassed and the facility is protected against unacceptable risk.  For 30 years the townships engineering firm has recommended an Equalization Basin to prevent unacceptable risk.  Northfield Township does not have the ability to meet their obligations for REUs issued on North Territorial Road (SAD) Green Oak Township Donna Lane (SAD) and most recently Whitmore Lake Road (SAD). In addition the areas in the Master Plan identified for residential development (Leland Farm Kelly Farm Seven Mile Road and the south end of Wildwood Lake) would be impacted by the limited capacity within the WWTP.  Until 2012 the WWTP was able to manage the higher water levels. With the WWTP experiencing 1 to 3 incidents of higher water levels per year the plant is no longer able to maintain a band-aide approach. To date in 2020 the plant was over the limits two times within 3 months  both times cited by the state.  In 2002 the circuit court of Livingston County ordered a judgement against Northfield Township requiring and granting the expansion of the plant to resolve the wastewater disposal and environment issues.  Since the WWTP is located in Green Oak Township an equalization basin has been approved by the Township Board and by the Green Oak Planning Commission. The bonding of the equalization basin is being threatened with a potential referendum in the election come November.  Stagnation of Growth and Development: Since 2002 Northfield Township has had stagnant growth within the township  the number of residential building permits started dropping in 2002 and continued through 2012. We are seeing a small uptick in residential building permits but not in viable levels. The Downtown Development Authority (DDA) receives a percentage of tax dollars for new development within the downtown district. Since 2002 there has been very limited funds to help with the improvements to the district as well as plan for future growth.  Revitalization of the Whitmore Lake Downtown District  In 2017 the Downtown Development Authority drafted a revitalization plan that identifies the key attributes of the downtown and steps needed to identify market niches. For downtown Whitmore Lake to thrive the district needs to become a destination that capitalizes on its proximity to the lake and attracts visitors. The creation of niche markets is a key component of the national main street model for revitalizing downtowns. The Township would likely benefit from businesses that have a unique character and could capitalize on marketing to commuters traveling between Ann Arbor and Brighton. Part of the revitalization plan is the sale of 75 Barker which is the center of the downtown district and development of public parking to support the future growth which the sale is currently pending.  North Village  In 2014 the township board acquired the Van Curler property consisting of 23 acres with 90 feet of lakefront property. Between 2016 and 2019 the township board received several proposals for development that consisted of residential and commercial venues which will also encompass a lakefront park center. The property has been off the tax rolls for six years and vital to the restoration of the Downtown District. The mission for North Village is The North Village development shall complement the surrounding neighborhoods historic architecture and traditional character of Downtown Whitmore Lake. Development shall be phased to address public amenities lake views and natural features desirable connections to Downtown parking site access community vitality.  Budget shortfalls from the State: Currently our townships state revenue sharing allocation decreased by over 6% providing a shortfall in the General Fund budget. With the States deficit at $6.8 Billion the township board is projecting that the Fiscal Year 2022 budget will possibly have deeper cuts. Its the fiduciary responsibility of the township board to manage the budget within the township. Northfield Township has always been conservative with the General Fund budget having an 80% reserve (fund balance limit). With a possible economic downturn the township board will need to adjust the fund balance limits closer to 40% (which is still in good standing) which means managing the tax dollars even closer.",political,Facebook

I am the Libertarian candidate for NYS Assembly from the 107th District and the reason I am running is because government has become like the tail wagging the dog. Most people these days look to government to solve all our problems and to protect us from everything we don't like. I believe that a legitimate reason for government to exist is to protect citizen rights however we appear to expect it to protect us from emotional hurt and what we consider offensive also. Instead of looking to each other for support and to resolve differences we look to government and then wonder why we are such a divided nation.  It is us vs. them. D vs. R. Blue vs. Red. Blue vs. BLM. As a Libertarian I would love to crack open this duopoly. Start real dialogue once again. There is a third candidate for US President Jo Jorgensen who will be on the ballot in all 50 states and DC and should be considered a viable third option. However the D/R duopoly and the mainstream press ignore her because a third option doesn't work well with us vs.them and keeping us divided.  There is also a third option in this Assembly race and that is me. I pledge to you that I will listen to and work with constituents to solve problems and not just push a divisive agenda.  Over the next several weeks I plan on posting statements on particular issues such as COVID-19 and government response policing and criminal justice the environment the second amendment drugs mental health and political discrimination.  I encourage you to exert your individuality in thought over the next 2 months and not let any group try to put you in a box. Vote you. Peace to you all and thanks for listening.,political,Facebook
Good morning everyone! Here is a good article about the property value increase.  Copied from the Newnan Times Herald. Saturday July 25 2020  LOCAL  County to take 'rollback' millage rate  BYSARAHFAYCAMPBELL  sarah@newnan.com  The Coweta County Commission will be adopting the rollback millage rate for property taxes or possibly something even lower. But exactly what that millage rate will be is yet to be determined.  The rollback rate is the property tax millage rate that will bring in the same amount of revenue on existing properties as last year's millage rate did.  A rollback rate is lower than the previous year's millage rate if property values have increased.  Under state law if local governments plan to adopt a millage rate higher than the rollback rate it's a tax increase ? even if the millage rate is staying the same or going down.  If a tax increase is proposed there must be three public hearings before the vote.  If a governing body plans to adopt the rollback rate one public hearing is required.  The public hearing will be Aug. 18 at 6 p.m. and will be held during the regularly -scheduled commission meeting. The millage rate will be set later during that meeting.  With the current economic impact of COVID-19 'we think it is incumbent on the board and staff to present something very favorable on behalf of the taxpayers' County Administrator Michael Fouts said after Tuesday night's meeting. 'And we're trying to do that.'  Coweta's tax digest ? the total value of all taxable property in the county ? is up significantly following a countywide revaluation of residential and agricultural properties.  Though the assessment notices property owners received in the mail show an estimated tax increase no local government has set its millage rate yet.  The overall digest is up 17 percent though 6 to 8 percent of that is new construction Mike Marchese Coweta chief appraiser said last month.  Many Cowetans saw dramatic increases in their property value particularly land value with some seeing increases of hundreds of thousands of dollars. Other residents saw more modest increases and a few saw property values decrease.  Many Coweta residents have submitted appeals of their new property tax assessments. The appeal deadline is Aug. 10.  The annual property tax assessment and the digest are based on the value of property on Jan. 1 of each year by law.  'A lot of people are saying how ow dare the board adopt the rate given the environment?'' Fouts said referring to the economic impact of COVID-19.  But the new assessment values don't reflect COVID-19 because they are as of Jan. 1.  Fouts said county staff received a preliminary digest late Friday.  The county always has to set a millage rate based on a preliminary digest before all appeals are completed. But this year there are a lot more appeals than normal.  Despite that  'we've run the numbers and feel confident in the rollback number' Fouts said following Tuesday night's commission meeting.  'If we are able to dial it back even more that is our goal.'

ICYMI-Heres who we are. Thanks for your consideration.  Andrew Seltzer for Ramsey Board of Education  When my wife Rachel and I moved to Ramsey in 2011 we were amazed at how friendly and welcoming the Ramsey community was. We chose Ramsey largely because of its excellent school system the quality of life we observed around town and to be close to family in Bergen and Westchester counties. Over ten years later and we are still grateful for our good fortune and good decision.  Since 2011 time we have watched our two children Henry (14) and Samatha (9) thrive under the nurturing and challenging environment provided by the Ramsey school district and the larger Ramsey community. I believe that a public school district is a direct reflection of the communitys standards culture and character. Based on my personal experiences I am a wholehearted supporter and proponent of our districts staff administration curriculum and governance.  I am a product of a similarly outstanding public school system in Westchester New York. This strong early educational foundation contributed to my subsequent academic achievements that include a BA in Art History from Skidmore College an MA in Art History and an MBA in Finance from New York University.  During a 20-year career at Christies auction house I filled a series of senior leadership positions including International Business Director. When I left Christies I founded a consultancy that provides business management services to art galleries auction houses art fairs and artist studios. My work helps these companies to improve existing and develop new administrative financial and operational capabilities that reduce costs and increase revenue.  My experiences communicating and coordinating across cultures perspectives and functional areas of expertise are a tremendous asset to the Ramsey School District. I believe that my balanced academic and practical achievements and appreciation for both the creative arts and the nuts and bolts of complex organizations will continue to contribute value to the Board of Education.,political,Facebook
An Important Message to those we serve:  Recently the 2021-2022 budget was approved by the Board of Fire Commissioners and presented to the public for a vote of acceptance. Unfortunately this budget did not pass approval by those that came out to vote. While many people would not advocate for the raising of taxes to support governmental needs it has proven to become necessary in the interest of continued improved public safety and delivery of water services a vital need to all residents and businesses. It is also probably likely that misinformation has been spread including some suggestions to cut money made at the last budget meeting on May 24 by the sole commissioner who opposed accepting the budget. We would like to share some of the experiences our members deal with daily in support of the mission of the Cromwell Fire Department our brothers and sisters of IAFF Local 4662 the Fire Marshal Office and the Water Division. In this business we know that even if your opinion is not in the majority you must stick together to support the mission you are tasked with overall. If is often easy to put the needs of these services at the bottom of the priority list because most people live their entire lives unimpacted by the need for emergency services however much like the insurance policy you have on your home or car it is certainly there when you need it most and werent planning on it. As the cost of apparatus infrastructure upgrades and equipment continue to rise we ask you to consider the impact of this budget to the overall mission of protecting lives and property and delivering a quality water service. We are fortunate to work with the Commission to help them deliver quality services to those that live and work in Cromwell.  The Fire District Board of Fire Commissioners has spent hours upon hours vetting and discussing the budget for the upcoming year much like the local government does. There has been meeting after meeting open to the public totaling well over 15 hours to try to come up with a budget that works for all. For years the District has prided itself in keeping rates for its taxpayers low. From our members attending this years budget process meetings it is clear there is nothing else to trim from the budget that would not directly impact the safety of the public in a negative manner. They have gone back to the drawing board and approved a slight modification to the original budget presented that will be voted on for approval on Monday June 7.  Due to necessary changes in staffing plans in the Fire Department two years ago the town is now served by a fire department fully on duty 24/7/365. In addition to the staff on duty the fire department utilizes a small number of part-time and volunteer personnel that can be recalled for larger emergencies and like many communities the department struggles with the availability of these personnel. Prior to that our Dispatchers would alert responders to calls and wait upwards of 5-10 minutes for someone to try to respond. You now have Fire/EMS responders that are responding from their location in the firehouse within seconds and arriving on scene within minutes of the call. In comparing the mill rates of surrounding agencies you will see that the increase proposed remains lower given what is provided to those in Cromwell. Additionally those agencies are utilizing entirely full-time employees while Cromwell uses part-time personnel to offset costs. Grants have been awarded to the Department to offset the costs of this staff and it is time to plan responsibly and invest in the future of the Fire Department as the demand for service grows with the growth of the Town of Cromwell as a whole. Kicking the can down the road is no longer a viable option and will prove to be a dangerous gamble in terms of life safety.  From May 2020 to May 2021 the call volume within the District has risen by 8.51%. This is before we even discover what the addition of the new Missionary Road complex Field Road developments and Nike Site condos will bring to the demand for services in additional call volume. There are currently 6 FF/EMTs staffing one BLS ambulance and one fire suppression piece around the clock attempting to adhere to NFPA standards regarding fire protection response and safety standards. When a second medical call occurs the Dispatchers must tone out off-duty personnel to respond and hope that someone answers the call within two minutes. If not the call is transferred to a mutual aid transport agency to respond which can add minutes to the response times if they are even available to take the call. The average time to acquire a mutual aid ambulance was 5.57 minutes utilizing this system. This is the time it takes for the Dispatcher to locate a service in the area that can respond to Cromwell to assist with the call. This does not include the time it takes them to arrive on the scene which showed an average total of 18.42 minutes from the time of call made. The longest time for an ambulance to respond was 44 minutes. Imagine you are waiting nearly 20 minutes or more after calling 911 for an ambulance to show up to transport your loved one. We cannot explain to you what it is like to answer a phone call from someone who has already called 911 asking if the ambulance is on the way while trying to do the best you can to comfort them and assure them that help is on the way given the resources you have at hand.  During the COVID pandemic the District implemented a 7th Firefighter/EMT responder on duty during peak times to provide for the ability of the 2nd Ambulance to respond by on-duty staff. The staffing allows for one fire suppression piece and two staffed BLS ambulances. The 5.57 minutes to acquire an ambulance for the second call was cut down to 45 seconds to dispatch our own resources that are available. The average response time was cut from 18.42 minutes to approximately 7 minutes with our own staff able to respond. There is no question that this staffing is a benefit to those that rely on services in their greatest time of need. The minimal proposed increase to the fire district mill rate includes covering the cost of this ability to staff two ambulances during identified peak times of call volume which during COVID is something that was unanimously approved by ALL Commissioners. Relying on Mutual Aid agencies for every day calls is not a viable answer. It is an expense to taxpayers in other communities paying for those services and they are often unavailable in a timely manner. Furthermore the use of mutual aid services means that another organization receives the money generated by EMS transport leaving a void in the Cromwell Budget.  The 7th Firefighter/EMT position also does not exist solely for EMS response. On-duty staff provide fire protection when available as well. The 7th Firefighter adds to the amount personnel available to respond to ALL Calls. Using emergency dispatch protocol our members gather information while taking emergency calls to determine the most appropriate response. Our system will determine the correct response and dispatch services appropriately. According to NFPA 1720 the standard which dictates the Organization and Deployment of Fire Suppression Operations by Combination and Volunteer Fire Departments the Fire Department in a suburban area shall strive to have a minimum of 10 personnel to respond with a response time of 10 minutes from notification. The 7th on-duty responder helps to meet this goal by raising the total staff on duty a guaranteed response. This staffing model also creates a safer working environment for the firefighters responding to emergencies who are already tasked with trying to do more with less which can be extremely dangerous. The Cromwell Fire Department averages a total of 2500 calls for service annually. When the primary ambulance is unavailable the 7th FF/EMT will allow the second ambulance to be staffed or the remaining 5 personnel on duty to mitigate other emergencies thus again reducing the reliance on Mutual Aid services being paid for by other communities.  Closing the West Street Fire Station as a cost saving measure as was ridiculously suggested proves as a useless means as a cost saving measure. The location and use of three fire stations in Cromwell allows for a reduced insurance rate for fire protection. The Insurance Services Office (ISO) provides ratings that consider many factors including 50% that comes from your fire departments staffing and firehouse locations. The proposed small mill rate increase would be minimal compared to the reduction in ISO rating that would skyrocket homeowner and business insurance rates. This location also not only provides home to the District Offices but also to the Fire Marshal Division and is the home to the marine unit near the Connecticut River.  The Water Division is also a vital service to the residents and businesses of Cromwell. For years they have been an understaffed division trying to manage as best they can. After keeping rates low to users for many years the time has come to provide better service. We urge you to compare the rates of surrounding communities to see that the rates paid currently are the lowest around. They are in dire need of an additional set of hands and the means to hook up connections to the north and south to prepare for any emergencies to our own infrastructure. Our Dispatchers not only answer every emergency call for Fire/EMS services but also monitor the facilities and alarms for the Water Division. During non-business hours all calls related to water division emergencies and inquiries are received in the Communications Center. Water Division personnel are on call 24/7 to answer calls and repair equipment. Calling for your Cromwell Fire District Water personnel cannot be compared to the level of service of any other utility. This is a local service meaning a quick response and the customer service is invaluable. The increased water rates may seem extensive at face value but the water division requires many infrastructure upgrades to better serve you the ratepayer. A portion of the upcoming budget is set for a pre-engineering study to prepare to connect services to the South (Middletown water) and to the North (MDC). Currently the Districts 4-million-gallon tank is required to undergo draining inspection and maintenance making the interconnection project necessary. The interconnection is also vital in the event of an infrastructure failure allowing water service to continue to residents and businesses. The Water rates have not been raised in 13 years in Cromwell and the proposed rate increase is less than $12/quarterly bill on the average water bill. Please consider the need of water service and delivery in your understanding of this budget proposal. In addition to the 50% of the ISO rating mentioned previously 40% of the scoring criteria comes from the availability of the water supply. The infrastructure upgrades to the water division will also aid in keeping your home insurance rates low.  In closing we wish to thank the 8 Fire Commissioners Executive Director and Department Heads for doing what is best overall in the interest of the taxpayers in Cromwell. While trying to keep the desperately needed increase low they have taken a stance to better protect those that live work and visit here and plan for the future. Through their fiscal responsibility rates have been kept extremely low in comparison to other communities and utility companies. At the next meeting for the budget on June 7 from 6pm-8pm we strongly urge those who may need us for services in the future to consider the approval of the proposed budget to protect themselves their families and their friends.  Sincerely The Executive Board of AFSCME Local 1303-475 Cromwell Professional Emergency Dispatchers,political,Facebook

"Critical Theory Critical Race Theory Education and Law Enforcement in the United States (publication pending)  Critical race theory although new in the popular vernacular began in the 1970s when some lawyers activist and legal scholars across the country realized that the heady advances of the civil rights era of the 1960s had stalled and in many respects were being rolled back (Delgado et al. 2021).  According to Delgado the critical race theory (CRT) movement is a collection of activists and scholars engaged in studying and transforming the relationship between race racism and power (Delgado et al. 2021). Delgado stated the significant propositions of CRT: (1) Racism is ordinary not aberrational; (2) white-over-color ascendancy serves important purposes both psychic and material for the dominant group; (3) the ""social construction"" thesis holds that race and races are products of social thought and relations and correspond to no biological or genetic reality; and (4) the dominant society racializes different minority groups at different times in response to shifting needs such as the labor market (Delgado et al. 2021).  Critical Race Theory  an analysis  In Delgado and Stefancic's seminal book on Critical Race Theory first published in 1999 with the most current 3rd edition published in 2017 the authors make no mention of the origins of Critical Race Theory. However it is material to a complete understanding of the concept. Critical Race Theory is but one of the many subfields of Critical Theory. These theories view society and politics with a Marxist worldview.  Critical Theory and Marx  Critical Theory (C.T.) is a Marxist approach to social philosophy that reflects and critiques society and its culture to uncover and challenge power structures. The modern C.T. theories have exchanged Marx's view of class conflict for race conflict. Other significant contributors to Critical Theory were Emile Durkheim and Max Weber.  In the postmodern era critical theorists deconstructed the breaking apart of cultural identities challenging the modernist era while viewing social problems as political problems with political solutions. While proponents praise this radical approach to reconstructing United States society critics of Critical Race Theory argue it lacks supporting evidence and has a worldview that reality is a social construct and relies on storytelling instead of scientific evidence.  Critical race theory became a hot topic of discussion in the public square since the mid-2020s and continues to the present. The two largest sub-domains to receive the public's attention are education (K-12) and law enforcement (Defund the Police).  The problem for the person-on-the-street is translating this academic debate into a public debate results in confusion and half-truths. Rufo opines ""Critical race theory is fast becoming America's new institutional orthodoxy yet most Americans have never heard of it  and those who have many don't understand it. (Rufo 2021)  Critical Theory  the foundation of Critical Race Theory  To tell the true nature of a tree one cannot examine just the tree branches but must study the root structure. Likewise to understand Critical race theory one must review the philosophy of Critical Theory.  Critical Theory is a Marxist approach to reflecting on the nature and purpose of how and why individuals in a society behave and how their individual and group behaviors impact other individuals and groups. Individual and group behaviors rarely occur in a vacuum but collectively they use social institutions to express the individuals and groups' decisions. These decisions are described in a political legal and moral context. What makes these Marxist theories troubling is advocates have removed them from the scholarly domain and put them in the public square with an activist approach to social change. The primary purpose of these theories is to reveal and challenge and change power structures between and among individuals and groups. Some favor a mob approach to change instead of rational political change.  In sociology and political philosophy ""Critical Theory is defined as the Western-Marxists philosophy of the Frankfurt School developed in Germany in the 1930s which drew on the ideas of Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud (Buchanan 2018).  The Marxist Approach  Marxists would decry the need to study the individual psyche and behaviors and family relationships because they believe that what creates human experience are the economic systems that structure human societies (Tyson 2014). For Marxists gaining and holding on to economic power is the motive behind all social and political activities including education philosophy religion government law enforcement the arts the media etc. (Tyson 2014).  While Critical Race Theory puts on the robes of theory and scholarship its advocates supporters and radical activists whose goals are aligned with Marxist views use pseudo-scholarship and conjecture to support their ideas.  For Marx and his followers ""economics is the base on which the superstructure of social/political/ideologies realties is built"" (Tyson 2014). The vehicle for gaining economic power is capturing social and political power  at all costs. In Marx's (Marx. Engles and Tucker 1978) critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right (1843) in advocating for revolution he stated  The weapon of criticism cannot of course replace criticism of the weapon; material force must be overthrown by material force but the theory also becomes a material force as soon as it has gripped the masses. The theory is capable of gripping the masses as soon as it demonstrates ad hominem and it demonstrates ad hominem as soon as it becomes radical. To be radical is to grasp the root of the matter.  Class vs. Race  Marxist analyze the behavior of humans their interactions and social interactions focused based on socio-economic classes. Marx theorized that differences in the socio-economic class divide people more than religion race gender and ethnicity (Tyson 2014). Critical theorists and by extension those who follow the ideas of Critical Race Theory embrace the philosophy and beliefs of Marx. But while Marx focused on the 'haves' (bourgeois) and 'have nots (proletariat)' the neo-Marxist have focused on the perceived struggle between the races. While acknowledging Native Americans Hispanics the LGBTQ community feminists and other persons of color the focus as evidenced by the prominence of Black Lives Matter is on conflicts between Black and Whites. The advocates and their followers (especially those who have no understanding of the rationale behind Critical Race Theory seek to create an environment of 'race conscious' instead of uniting society for the benefit of ALL. Posing as scholars they interject their arguments with words and phrases designed to divide and inflame  not to connect people. They use whiteness white guilt the 1619 project (Magness 2020) all steeped with false analogies and fallacious reasoning to stir discontent.  Instead of teaching history and letting mature students reflect on its consequences for the present CRT advocates reimagine the past as the reason for all evil. The lens through which everything is evaluated is the Marxist view of Critical Theory. Subfields of Critical Theory include environmental family gender health medical political knowledge law etc. Two prominent subfields populating the conversation of many individuals business leaders politicians and the media are Education and Law Enforcement.  Capitalism  Marx thought capitalism was part of the stage of economies that would eventually end. In many countries he and his followers advocated and fought for a revolutionary overthrow of capitalist counties that would lead to socialism as a prelude to communism. Even though critics of Marx's philosophies point to the failure of the Communism Bloc in Europe and other parts of the world neo-Marxists point out that none of these countries completely follows the principles outlined by Marx (Tyson 2014). Instead of accepting these failed ideologies Neo-Marxist uses Critical Theory to understand these failures to achieve their ultimate goals and promote an anti-capitalist agenda.  The Family  For Marx and by extension those who believe and follow his tenants the family is not the source of the individual's reason for existence. The family and its members are merely products of material and historical circumstances (Tyson 2014). Marx saw the family unit as a means to promote the values and maintenance of capitalism (Marx et al. 1978a) and therefore it was anathema to his goal of eliminating capitalism. To encourage an anti-capitalist agenda within the United States advocates of CRT think set about to teach this philosophy in schools (K-12).  Critical Race Theory  a branch of CRT  The prominent branch of Critical Theory for the general populace of United States Citizens in 2021 is Critical Race Theory (CRT). CRT advocates push an activist agenda and view human activity based on race instead of class. These advocates use the lens of race to see the past present and future. Some advocates (Delagado Stefancia 2021) question foundational liberal concepts such as rationality legal equality and Constitutionality neutrality. In their view they believe the world is Black or White - literally. Many of these advocates criticize much of the civil rights law and anti-discrimination laws i.e. Brown v. Board of Education. Some foster more radical views of Critical Race theory for non-white cultural separatism and reparations (Delgado Stefancic 1993). Ideas developed in CRT are based on personal experience and storytelling as opposed to empirical evidence. For Delgado and others ""It's about righting wrongs not just the quest for knowledge"" (Delgado Stefancic 2021).  Education  the entry point - indoctrination  An essential question to students' parents and is the purpose of education and the role of schools in 21st century America. The answers have changed over time and continue to change. One example of the past is a statement by Elwood Cubberley Dean of the Graduate School of Education (1917-1933) ""Our schools are in a sense factories in which the raw products (children) are to be shaped and fashioned into products to meet the various demands of life (The Historical Purpose of American Public Education n.d.)."" Current views are revealed n in a 2018 report in which stakeholders gave their ideas about the purpose of education (K-12): (Silliman & Schleifer 2018). The reported findings were:  Although preparing students academically is the most often cited goal of public education Americans also believe that schools should prepare students to be good citizens and prepared for work. While about half 45 percentof Americans believe that the main goal of public education should be to prepare students academically 26 percent believe that the primary goal should be to prepare students to be good citizens and 25 percent say it is to prepare them for work; Preparing students academically may encompass a range of goals including ensuring their success in college or providing the academic skills they need for the workforce.   Significantly no replies indicated that the purpose of American schools was to indoctrinate children with any specific philosophy or belief system. Indeed nowhere within the scholarly literature or their reports or surveys indicating that indoctrinating children in grades K-12 is a legitimate educational goal. Yet there are numerous accounts within the media and other sources that schools indoctrinate K-12 students either directly or indirectly emphasizing Critical Race Theory and other racial constructs.  In reaction to school systems forcing a particular belief system on impressionable children many states passed laws restricting the ideas espoused in Marxist Critical Race Theory. It is worrisome to many that while the philosophy of CRT may not be explicitly stated the reaction of some school administrators is to circumvent the laws through concealment or outright disobedience to both the letter and spirit of the law. Administrators do this through teacher training and masking the curriculum as History lessons. A review of literature on Critical Race Theory shows that the goal of CRT is not teaching history but promoting the concept of racial division.  Marx in speaking about philosophers in his Theses on Feuerbach said ""The philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways; the point however is to change it (Marx 1975. P.620). This change was to be done through 'anti-capitalist classrooms and lecture halls where teacher-designed curriculum to change society including the constitution and operation of schools. (Rikowski 2004)  Law enforcement and Education  Critical Theory and Critical Race Theory both rooted in Marxism reflect their activist roots and radical change goals through organizations such as 'Black Lives Matter and movements such as 'Defund the Police.' These activities impact the Educational System when administrators and teachers modify standard academic lessons to teach radical theory.  Through the daily actions and behaviors of tens of thousands of law enforcement officers associated with thousands of local state and federal agencies the laws of local state and federal governments are enforced. For most people the focus is on the local police agency and their officers since they are likely to view or interact with them regularly.  Constitutional Basis  Police Powers are granted to the various states by the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution - ""The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution nor prohibited by it to the States are reserved to the States respectively or to the people.""  Legislative bodies within the various states enact laws designed to govern behavior and enforce order to improve the safety and security of its citizens. With these laws police are granted the power to compel compliance with these laws as long as their actions do not infringe upon rights protected by the United States or State Constitution. Some critical protections deal with due process and other protections granted by the ""Bill of Rights.""  Over time the phrase ""serving the police"" became attached to the mission of police organizations. In 1963 the Los Angeles Police Department adopted the motto ""To Protect and Serve"" (The Origin of the LAPD Motto - Los Angeles Police Department n.d.) which has been adopted in some form by many other police departments throughout the United States. This duality and mixing of protecting and serving creates conflict among citizens police officers legislators and executives. The fruits of this conflict stem from the actions of various organizations ranging from Black Lives Matter to Defund the Police.  Confidence in Law Enforcement  For the first time in Gallup's surveying public attitudes toward the police its survey found that most American adults do not trust law enforcement (Brenan 2021). The survey showed that confidence in the police had fallen five-point to 48 percent from 2019 to 2020 (Ortiz 2020). The problem is that police officers and administrators are caught in a political firestorm of debate surrounding their role as peacekeepers of community behavior. The discussion is highlighted when looking at the political divisions within the survey results. ""The survey found that Republicans' confidence in the police had risen seven points to 82 percent while Democrats' faith in law enforcement dropped six points to 28 percent"" (Ortiz 2020).  While the survey did not ask any questions about group membership or work status the survey found that 56 percent of white adults said they had confidence in the police while only19 percent of black adults had confidence in the police. According to the Gallup survey this 37-point gap is more significant than any previous survey results.  ""One of the starkest metrics in this year's poll is that 11 percent of Black Americans express confidence in the criminal justice system Mr. Younis editor in Chief of the New York Times said. ""That means nine out of 10 Black Americans in this country do not have confidence in a process built on the theory that all citizens are equal before the law.  This compares with the extremely low number of 24-percent of white Americans which shows an overall lack of confidence in the criminal justice system.  While there is no evidence of a causal relationship between the 'low confidence in the police' as reported by the respondents to the survey and the 'actions of organizations such as Black Lives Matters or incidents of fatal shootings of blacks by the police Dr. Goff co-founder and chief executive of Center for Policing Equity and a professor of African-American studies and psychology at Yale said (Ortiz 2020):  Dr. Goff said that the racial gap in trust in the police could be attributed to the ""kind of law enforcement people from different racial groups tend to receive in this country"" and that ""none of these things are mysteries. It is exactly for the reasons that you think it is.""  But what Dr. Goff found most noteworthy is that now a majority does not have confidence in law enforcement. That's ""unprecedented in this country"" he said and it creates a problem for public safety because compliance with the law ""begins with trust in it and not fear of it.""  It remains to be seen if this year is ""merely a low point for this institution or if confidence in police will continue to suffer beyond 2020"" Mr. Younis said.  Conclusion  Education and law enforcement and under attack by the activist-advocates of Critical Race Theory. The great majority of police officers see their job as protecting and defending the Constitution of the United States and the specific Constitution of the state in which they serve. Most teachers have goals of developing students to be successful in whatever careers their students want to pursue.  Our future as a free country is at risk  and how we educate our children is critical to the outcome. Education is at a crossroads and the future will be decided by the choices citizens make by electing leaders who choose the path of preparing students ready for a career or college. The other path leads to division and discontent with students parents teachers and all citizens and business leaders who desire students who are prepared to be happy and productive community members.  The outcome lies in what political philosophy the United States and the various state Representatives and Senators will follow. Will they choose through legislation the Marxist ideas and goals of Critical Theory Critical Race Theories in which the proponents of these theories advocate radical change or will they choose the path of ""One nation under God indivisible with Liberty and Justice for all.

Top Reasons to Vote Yes on 4A!  4A is a smart and targeted use of tax monies without raising taxes.  Pueblo District 70 earned a Prestigious BEST grant of $4million dollars. The grant requires a match from the district - 4A would be that match.  Our districts school roofs are in bad need of repair and replacement some are over 30 years old. 4A will fix the roofs.  Every school in our district will benefit from the passage of 4A.  Pueblo District 70 does more with less resources than almost any other school district in the State. 4A will be a big boost to our schools our children and our community.  We are all aware of the need for clean air to combat the spread of viruses. 4A will improve the air filtration system in every school.  4A is a boost for our Community. The Bonds will benefit students homeowners local businesses and teachers.  Students - Better and safer learning environment  Home Owners - Good schools are the number one external driver in home values  Local Businesses - A large percent of the work will be done by local companies  Teachers - Upgraded classrooms are a key part of a learning environment,political,Facebook
Our state parks alone (not including Acadia National Park) bring in more than $100 million to Maine's economy. Maine only conserves 20% of its land while other New England states conserve much more. Maine's entire economy is based on our environment. Investing in the environment is a return that keeps on giving. We're leaving a lot of money at the state border by failing to keep pace with our neighbor states on conservation. Research shows there is untapped potential in our environment in Maine: hundreds of millions of additional dollars could flow into Maine's economy -- and in areas that need it the most in our poorest counties -- if we increased conservation with public access. I support funding Land for Maine's Future. PROTECTMAINE.ORG protectmaine.org,political,Facebook
The public health emergency of Covid-19 exposed vulnerabilities in the United States' educational system. The need for remote learning unveiled the neglect of the diverse learning styles of children. The one-size-fits-all format of online learning has done a disservice to the education and socialization of this demographic. Additionally it revealed parental organizational and time management deficiencies in assisting their children in the remote learning environment. There is an expectation that the children will suffer educational and social skills regression.  The SELAH Project recognizes the insufficiencies of the educational system and offers individualized family solutions. These solutions range from remote classroom setup to social skills/youth leadership programs to supplemental education offerings.  Let us help your child thrive during this public health and educational crisis.,political,Facebook
Mayors Message on BOE Choosing Virtual-Only Learning  I have gotten many questions and seen many comments online about the BOEs decision to start school as virtual-only learning on September 14th a decision based on the inability of our schools current HVAC systems to use the States recommended air filters.  Yes I am disappointed that the student in-school option is off the table at this time but I support the decision not to send our children teachers and administrators into what the State has declared to be an unsafe situation. If we wouldnt ask our children to use playground equipment or eat school lunches known to be below the recommended safety standards we can hardly choose to put them in a potentially unsafe environment during a pandemic. The safety of all our residents is my highest priority and I dont believe we should ever compromise on that.  Im also sympathetic to those families who will be under enormous stress while trying to juggle virtual learning and work. But what I have learned from this pandemic is that our community responds to needs of its neighbors. All throughout the crisis this spring and summer we supported food banks provided meals and assistance to shut-ins and looked out for our most vulnerable. I know we can find a way to safely help each other through this latest challenge. Im confident we will.  Whether you agree or disagree with the districts decision I implore us all to speak and act responsibly and with kindness. Having gone through so much and come so far together this year lets not tear ourselves apart when we need each other the most.  Lets act like residents of the town we wanted Scotch Plains to be when we moved here. Despite our divisions and disagreements we are one community.  I believe I speak for everyone on the Council when I say that we will all do whatever we can to help get us through this situation and come out a stronger and more caring town.,political,Facebook

Tonight candidates for Southgate City Council were given the honor of participating in a Meet and Greet at the Southgate VFW. Prospective candidates were given a forum to deliver a 2 minute speech about who they are and why they deserve your vote.  I have to say that I was not completely satisfied with my presentation and since some of you were not able to attend. I would like to provide the background I shared and some additional sound bites.  A little about myself I have been a Southgate resident for almost 25 years. I moved here with my son for better schooling a better environment and more recreational opportunity and I was familiar with the area through my now husband who is a lifelong Southgate resident. Im a graduate of Wayne State University with a Bachelors degree in Criminal Justice. I have almost 30 years of professional experience working for companies such as Comerica Bank General Motors and presently Ford Motor Company as a Program Analyst. My roles over the years have varied but I have excelled in the areas of Operations/Project Management and Project Implementations. My son graduated from Anderson after attending NorthPointe Gerisch and Davidson. He participated in multiple sports throughout his school years concentrating on football and basketball in high school. That loss to Devin Gardner and Inkster in the regionals with one of Andersons best football teams in somewhat recent history still hurts. Everyone remembers me as Frankies mom  which is a lifelong appointment that Im still proud of.  Present Day! I have reached a point in my life/our lives where I am ready to give back more and in a more meaningful and direct way then I have previously. Life is about changing priorities and opportunity; whether it is delaying the completion of collegiate pursuit for family or changing my career goals due to a changing world or in this case refocusing my service goals for community. I have the opportunity I know I have the ability and I am making my service to this city as a prospective member of this city council a priority. My professional experience and life experience make me a stand-out candidate in the following ways:  I believe in innovation  and can leverage all of my change management and implementation experience to put action to ideas and words.  I believe in being responsive to and an advocate for all of our citizens. Our citizens and the betterment of our community should always come first and that makes their point of view an absolute priority; my career experience has taught me without question that an assortment of opinions is always superior to a top-down approach. This involves our citizens directly and providing them open and transparent avenues for their ideas to be heard.  I am skilled in all of the areas of project management. I have been a project lead in an Operational capacity for a variety of projects in scope and depth and have participated as a key contributor in many others. I thoroughly understand project budgeting scope creep forecasting time and resource management and overall implementation strategies at an expert level. I believe these skill sets are invaluable in one of the only Downriver cities that is required to have a balanced budget and requires unique and differing perspective to keep that budget in balance while maintaining improving and adding to the variety of programs that make our community great. Ive been endorsed by the UAW Region 1A longtime resident and legend of the city Mrs. Anna Renaud and former Southgate Fire Chief and fellow Rotarian Stephen Ahles. I come to you as a resident that wants to do her part and be of service with the mindset of How Can I Help?

As your Mayor my job is to advocate for everyone. Virtual Learning unfortunately has left so many working parents in Linden in Limbo. Many of these parents I found out opted for the hybrid model because of their financial situation they had to return to work . I will continue to work to find a solution for them. I also understand that Board members are not only the watchdog for our children but for also the taxpayers. This is why I offer the Board an alternative plan that will satisfy the taxpayers working parents and help the furloughed employees . I have learned that the Board's decision was based on the District having to switch abruptly from a hybrid model to all virtual as a result of teacher shortage. With the school buildings empty with no children to service in the classrooms cafeteria and playground certain positions were no longer applicable in a remote learning environment and for them to keep employees on the payroll with nothing to do many felt uncomfortable. Although I understand but I believe this could have been handled with compassion and empathy.  With so many parents having to return to work and in need of a safe place to leave their children I am suggesting that we allow the district to use our city buildings and any available space up to and including the Linden Board of Education and additional properties if needed to accomplish such an endeavor and adhere to social distancing guidelines. This is one possibility where the Board can utilize the furloughed staff to supervise these children to ensure that they stay focused during online lessons. We cannot ignore the fact that in an all virtual educational setting some children will be left behind and we must do everything in our power to make sure this doesn't happen. This alternative plan is a win win situation for everyone. I feel strongly that this qualifies as a COVID emergency . I will be reaching out to the Governor as well to discuss this situation.,political,Facebook
Weekly Post!  Why vote for me for school board?  Being a police officer will provide great insight as a school board member as we make decisions that are best for ALL of our children!  I believe wholeheartedly that one priority should be safety for our schools and community. I chose public service as a career because I believed in helping and serving others. This career has given me many opportunities to be a better policeman. I have attended and successfully completed the National Association of School Resource Officers (NASRO) class this year in March! This training provided me with great information on what an SRO is and their responsibilities inside of our school buildings. Communication between an SRO and the school staff is very important and critical for a successful and safe environment. I am happy to say that I have a close and positive relationship with all of our SROs. Being able to assist in some of our Emergency Evacuation Drills for our schools has been very informative and allowed me an opportunity to see how each plan differs from school to school.  As a police officer I was privileged to attend the Boone Delaware Henry and Wayne County Collaborative Steering Committee Meeting. This meeting was a review of results in reference to the programs affiliated with; Policing The Teen Brain Resilience For Youth and the Why Try Organization. These training opportunities were organized by a LOCAL Mrs. Jean Gaha! This program was wonderful and provided great insight into how to understand the mindset of our children in todays world.  I would love to earn your vote this upcoming election please Vote Trey Hendrix For School Board!  Great Schools Build Great Communities!,political,Facebook

Dear Friends I am running to make a difference in the Governing Board of the Berryessa Union School District. I am passionate about education and other issues that affect our children and our community. Those with whom I have worked in the North Valley Council PTA Sierramont PTSA Cherrywood Home & School club Berryessa Music Boosters and Berryessa District Advisory Council know about my dedication towards the betterment of our schools.  I feel that it is time for some fresh ideas and new thinking to help with a challenging educational environment for our students and educators alike. I will bring to the BUSD board everything that I have learnt by interacting with parents students and educators over the past several years to make sure that we have all the necessary tools to help our students succeed.  Please support me in my quest to make a positive impact in our community.,political,Facebook
I find it disturbing that an inherently apolitical position such as School Board has been hijacked and transformed into the gateway for larger political maneuvers.  The charter of a School Board is simple -- with the input of parents and teachers create an environment that best educates the most students in the most efficient manner.  We all suffer from political bias but let's check that at the door and get down to the business of teaching kids how to read write and do arithmetic.,political,Facebook
"I support shifting the financial burden of managing recyclable waste from the taxpayers to the producers of recyclable packaging. Large corporations need to fully account environmental impact into the cost of doing business. Taxpayers have for far too long had to pick up the slack in cleaning up environmental messes left behind by profiting corporations. The cost of ""fixing"" the environment needs to be incorporated into business models not left to the public to fund. They can profit well enough after helping to leave the environment as healthy as it was before they manufactured and packaged their products. It is a social responsibility for corporations to fund our management of the waste they create. PROTECTMAINE.ORG protectmaine.org",political,Facebook
After 4 terms (8 years) of serving the the residents of Minneola I have decided not to run in the next election. I appreciate the support I have received over the years and look forward to serving my community outside of the government platform. There are 3 candidates for Seat 2 and I wish them all luck in the race.  I am endorsing Daniel Smith in this race. Daniel has been attending council meetings since moving to Minneola from Orlando a few years ago. He shares his thoughts and perspectives and has presented good ideas and valid points on a number of issues. He understands growth will happen and also believes in protecting the environment and creating habitats for the wildlife that lives in the area. I am confident that Daniel will be a strong voice for all of Minneola and will work diligently to ensure Minneola continues to thrive and provide a brighter future for us all.,political,Facebook
The New Mayor of St Pete? As the mayoral Primaries are nearing us BodyCams4StPete spent time with some of the candidates running to be our next Mayor on November 2. Some of these times were spent privately and others in public forums simply observing the campaigns without interacting with the candidates (our preferred scientific method by the way).  The BodyCams4StPetePD approach: We do not accept money for our findings. We spend countless personal hours analyzing the ecology in which we operate in order to come up with the best observation.  We conduct endorsement research according to these rules: 1. We consider personal statements only when they are backed by verifiable past actions. 2. While past actions are indicators of future actions we account for personal growth. 3. We consider a candidates environment and its influential on their future decisions.  As always some of you will quickly comment What does BodyCams4StPetePD have to do with the Mayoral campaign or any political campaign as a matter of fact? My answer is the police accountability and police reform movement dubbed BodyCams4StPetePD started with a chance encounter with StPetePD. As a military veteran and citizen of St. Petersburg for over 20 Years this encounter opened my eyes to a broken policing system that was neither protecting nor serving and badly in need of proper supervision. I wanted better for my son and daughters and their sons and daughters. Since then StPetePD responded to the many critiques and brought some much needed changes and updated processes to the department. I am not saying that they are cured and totally healed I am simply saying they are on a better course. During these two years of operation I discovered that some elected officials and local leaders were responsible for this state of affairs. So with that discovery we strategically evolved to mean unbiased accountability of all public figures. I believe if we could always have unbiased accountability in our professional lives we would be better at our primary civic job which is to take care of one another.  This article is based on face-to-face meetings with Vincent Nowicki and Darden Rice attendance of a Youth Summit by Ken Welch and multiple anonymous attendances at local events. I also postponed this article a couple weeks to consider the entry into the race by Councilman Blackmon. Michael Ingram and Marcile Powers are not the subject of this article. We deal in statistical probabilities of winning the race or probabilities of affecting the outcome of the race.  First the disruptor candidate: Vincent Nowicki. I first met Vincent on a beautiful spring day when he was canvassing door to door in my neighborhood. I was impressed with his dedication to his campaign. He is smart and charismatic and carried a good political conversation with my son and me. According to Vincent his focus is on the youth sewer and affordable housing. Also he is not a fan of the current Mayor and called Rick a corrupted politician. I asked for a second meeting to get to know the candidate better. After all its not every day that we see a candidate campaigning door to door. Even Aaron Burr found it exhausting in the 1800s. I watched Vincent going down my street and knocking on every door. For intellectual curiositys sake or for better political understanding I had to find out more. We met at a locally owned restaurant Salty Js on Fourth Street. The meeting was pleasant but cold and the back and forth became robotic. I walked away from the meeting thinking that he left Baltimore to escape the same issues that he wants to fix in St. Pete. Why not stay there and make a difference? When asked about several of his published positions and statements Vincents brief residency in the Sunshine City was clear. He was unaware of the citys history both long past and recent and the impact it continues to have today. He showed little to no regard for the views and needs of huge swaths of this city including anyone over 40 and city employees. His derision toward other local politicians and the idea of being one of several on a city council instead of mayor left me to wonder how much this campaign was about the people of the city or himself.  Next I will address our serial political runner: Wengay Newton. He does not have a path to win and he knows it but he is happy to take away votes from the South Side political machine. Bless your heart Sir!  Speaking of the South Side political machine I gave great interest to Ken Welchs campaign. I am accustomed by now to the narrow focus of District 7 politicians which was adequate so far for the representation of South St. Pete. The mayoral political winner will represent the entire city and not just the far south of the city. Regardless of my past experiences with S. St. Pete politicians and everything Ive learned so far about their involvement in the sad plight of my fellow African Americans who do not reside on the sunny side of the South Side I reset and put it aside and approached Kens campaign with an open mind. I followed and observed his campaign from afar until an opportunity to have a closer look presented itself. The candidate in focus here facilitated a Youth Summit and I thought it would be a great opportunity to see his approach in an equitable and inclusive way to solve the problems that the youth face in our city. This particular youth summit was by the south side for the south side made up by mostly Lakewood high administrators teachers and youth. It was a Lakewood estate affair. If you need to hold a summit to figure out the need of your youth that reside in your own well-to-do community I believe that you are out of touch. When a young man  outside of the bubble - in search of mental health stated his needs he was greeted with the slogan here in South St Pete we take care of our own while being tone deaf to this childs mental health issues. This staffers completely misguided approach to a young person in obvious distress gave me pause to consider who Ken Welch would be surrounding himself with and how they would twist the voice of his constituency. A mayor is representing the entire city and it seems that Mr. Welch is incapable so far of moving on from the us vs them mentality. As mayor he will no longer represent just the South of St Pete but everyone from every part of the city. I am not convinced that this simple task of being everyones representative registered yet with the candidate.  I wish I could have sat down with councilman Blackmon to get his input for entering the race. We are acquaintances on Facebook since his run for councilman and we occasionally debate the peoples business on there. I would have loved to have heard his reasons for entering the race so late. We could not get together. My observation is Blackmon is just too new to St. Pete politics to be Mayor. A few more years on the city council could change things for him but now today the city needs experienced leadership to take control.  I had the privilege to sit down with Darden Rice to discuss her background platform and vison. This chance meeting only happened because of a Vincent Nowicki statement in regards to breakfast at the Kraft Kafe. Bottom line upfront: I believe that Darden could have done more to get a more accountable body cam system for our police department that the citizens of St Pete deserve but how can I lean on Darden for her choice to go along with the African American Chief of Police to spend 6.76 million dollars on a bodycam system that would not have even captured George Floyds murder. We have two African Americans and NAACP members on the city council and a prominent African American as Deputy Mayor and City Administrator refusing to hold their employees accountable? Our so-called own is not advocating for what is best for us. This issue of bad policing is now on us. BodyCams4StPetePD is endorsing Darden for Mayor because our movement believes that Darden understands the role of the mayor is non-partisan and represents all of the people of St. Pete. Her campaign is a well-oiled machine but she is available and accessible to her constituency. Just like the other candidate I met with one-on-one Darden met me at a local restaurant Torianos. Darden graciously listened to the concerns that face my family and families like mine in our neighborhood and general concerns for the city. She spoke genuinely about working collaboratively with people from across the city to find solutions that are equitable and honor the citys past its unique culture in the present and building toward the future. She clearly works to educate herself on topics she may not experience personally and has a balanced view of the importance of home rule while maintaining constructive relationships throughout the county and the state for the benefit of all St. Petersburg residents.  This race is by design going to a run off. The black and the white votes are clearly divided. Once the primaries are over I expect to see two formidable candidates going toe-to-toe for the prize. This is where alliances will be forged for better or worse. This is where political character will be tested and reputation established.  By:,political,Facebook

ICYMI-Heres who we are. Thanks for your consideration.  Laura Leonard candidate for Ramsey Board of Education:  I have lived in Bergen County for the majority of my life graduating from Northern Highlands Regional High School. My husband Derek Landel also graduated from Northern Highlands. Together we chose to move to Ramsey 18 years ago and raise our family here. We were drawn to the strong sense of community and couldn't be happier with our decision. Derek and I are proud to have two daughters currently attending the Ramsey Public Schools. Both Ella and Madigan began their public education at Hubbard progressing to Dater then Smith and now attend Ramsey High School. I have been fortunate to volunteer at our childrens schools in a variety of capacities throughout the years. This afforded me the opportunity to support the staff who are providing our children rich and varied learning experiences.  I received a Bachelors Degree in Psychology along with a certification in Elementary Education from Clark University. I then chose to pursue my Masters Degree in Library and Information Science from Rutgers University. Fostering curiosity critical thinking and life-long learning while creating connections between people and information is my passion. This passion clearly aligns with the goals of the Ramsey Public Schools.  For the past twenty years I have committed my professional life to service community and education through public librarianship. My career began as a specialist in Teen and Reference Services focusing on information literacy school collaboration library collections and programming. In 2015 I took on the role of Library Director. In this capacity I am responsible for personnel budget and strategic planning in collaboration with the librarys Board of Trustees. I firmly believe in professional development and to that end I have served on or led numerous professional committees at the county and state level in order to grow my personal knowledge and facilitate learning among my colleagues. I held leadership positions as the President of the New Jersey Library Association Young Adult Services Section and co-chaired the New Jersey Library Associations conference for multiple years. I am committed to progressing projects and solving problems whether as a committee member or as a chairperson.  The success of our schools is of the utmost importance to our Borough. First and foremost schools educate our children so that they may make a positive contribution to society and grow as individuals. Schools anchor our community providing avenues for students and parents to create connections that enrich the lives of all residents. Excellent schools continually attract new residents to Ramsey by offering engaging curriculum a welcoming environment and diverse extra-curricular activities. This allows all our children to reach their greatest potential while discovering their authentic selves.  As a member of the Ramsey Board of Education I would focus on the responsibility of supporting students staff and administrators as they work towards advancing the goals set forth in the Profile of a Graduate. I have specific and relevant experience that qualifies me to serve. If given the opportunity I will apply my experience and knowledge to the benefit of the Ramsey community.,political,Facebook

Many are relieved and supportive of Friday's action by the Board of Education to postpone the Plan B blended learning model for Pre-K EC and Elementary School students; however my daughter an ABSS third grader was disappointed. My wife and I are also disappointed. Like all families who chose to participate in the blended learning model our family was looking forward to it and planning on it.  Ashlyn gave me a fake punch in the gut and a big frown and asked me why daddy? Every parent knows that face and the fake punch was deeply felt by this particular school board member.  I used different language speaking to my own kid an 8-year-old but my message to her was simple: Like others Im committed to returning students to school buildings as safely as possible and as soon as it is wise to do so. To do that our community health indicators need to be pointed in the right direction and the transitions need to be timed to minimize educational and operational disruptions.  For those reasons I voted in favor of the limited phased return during the school boards October 5 meeting; however the variables changed significantly since that time. Focused on the same set of priorities I supported the postponement for three primary reasons:  1) Health: County regional and state health trends related to Covid-19 are demonstrably worse than three weeks ago. Last week The White House Task Force and Governor Cooper named Alamance County a county of concern. The Superintendent and majority of the board determined the established October 28 (pre-K and K-2) and November 18 (grades 3-5) start dates were no longer prudent to keep students staff and the broader community safe.  2) Clarity: As a result the consensus question in front of the board became whether or not to again reconsider new start dates a few weeks from now in an upcoming board meeting putting everyone in state of limbo or to make a decision now to delay until the new term begins in January. Providing clarity to everyone as opposed to a very likely series of emotional start-and-stop decisions provides the opportunity for families teachers and employers to plan to organize and to support each other through execution.  3) Instruction time: The district has worked hard to establish the parameters of the plan B blended learning model. However many people rightly point out its biggest drawback  the amount of synchronous live instruction provided to students each week whether in person or virtual. A delay of three weeks would have put the new timelines (in a best case scenario) as November 18 and December 3 leaving 6 and 8 weeks remaining in the fall term respectively. Combining Election Day Veterans Day Thanksgiving Break and Winter Break there are 15 scheduled days off school (assuming no inclement weather days) during that time. Transitioning to a new learning model that reduces instruction time immediately before all those scheduled days off is problematic when compared to finishing the term as strong as possible under stable and established routines.  As we now focus on navigating the rest of this fall term Im confident ABSS will review what is working well under the plan C what is not and make adjustments. Additionally I will strongly advocate for the district to reaffirm the commitment to and supports for EC students families and educators.  Looking forward to hopefully returning all students to buildings in January it will be important for ABSS to continue refine its Plan B blended learning model. Specifically ABSS should do everything possible to 1) increase the amount of live synchronous instruction and 2) reduce classroom teacher assignment changes.  I believe in ABSS educators. Due to good planning providing them necessary technological resources and their effective work they are delivering substantially more than in the spring when everyone was thrown into an emergency situation. They will continue to get better and better in this remote environment. We see their hard work professionalism and their passion for students every day.  I believe in our district leaders and school administrators. They are balancing so much as they execute one set of plans and build others with ever-changing guidance and divisive political leadership all around them.  I believe in our students the one in my house and children across the district. I know too many are struggling emotionally socially and academically while many may also continue to thrive. Im confident our leadership and educators will do their very best to mitigate issues in advance identify them when they happen and intervene to help.  These decisions continue to weigh heavily on my heart and on my mind. As a member of the Board of Education I take full responsibility for them. But we must all take responsibility to limit the spread of this virus. That is the most direct way to return students to the classrooms. Please wear a mask wash hands and practice distancing. Failure to do so fails our kids.  Thank you for reading. ###,political,Facebook

"The Tale of Discriminations Retaliations Conspiracies and Cover-up at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton Washington State.  Part One  Although these events took place decades ago I was unable to start writing this story until the spring of 2018 because I could not relive the horrible memories.  Decades ago I used to work at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard (the Shipyard) in Bremerton Washington as a GS-11 Contract Specialist (1102). My primary duty was the administration of the four-million-dollar janitorial contract.  I was the only racial minority employee in the office. Beginning in the fall of 1991 I faced many years of hostile-work-environment in which three supervisors had labeled me a GS-5 worker and attempted to force me to quit my work. They barred me from attending staff meetings and in-house training. They also isolated me in the Telephone Office for two years during which they promoted the other 1102s to GS-12s. As a result I suffered from major depression and PTSD for decades. I continue to struggle to this day.  My former supervisors blatantly lied to the Shipyard EEO counselors and investigators. They had conspired and lied extensively with their friends during the EEOC Hearing on July 22 1999.  To conceal an illegal act of abolishing my veteran position by Mr. Hicks Ms. Stephanie Pappas the Shipyard Assistant Attorney blatantly lied multiple times to MSPB Judge Sidney Farcey in her document of January 19 1999.  Also to cover-up the illegal act she withheld two crucial documents from the judge. Further she had deceived my attorney and I firmly believe she misled the mediator and the Justice Department attorney as well.  After more than seven years of issues the Shipyard had falsely charged me with aggravated assault which they later dropped.  Examining my notes and the various documents Affidavits court records etc. that I had received from the Shipyard I compiled this story. These are some of the key events in ""The Veteran's Story.""  In November 1991 after I had raised a minor complaint Ms. Cheryl Reaume my immediate supervisor falsely accused me of awarding two contracts without funding. She and Mr. Kyle Hicks the Contracts Director labeled me a GS-5 employee for good. They had then assigned me to Mr. Tommy Horton an engineer in Contracts and disallowed me to attend weekly staff meetings and in-house training for the contract specialists (1102s).  Only after Mr. Horton had given me an unsatisfactory performance rating in May 1992 Ms. Reaume allowed me to participate in the meeting. However as her note of June 3 1992 indicates Sally will include Ken in all 1102 training sessions. (It is not required to include Ken in 462 staff meetings only if 1102 training is provided) she did not let me attend unless there was an in-house training was involved.  In December 1991 Ms. Reaume gave me a marginal performance rating which consisted of nothing but lies and exaggerations. In this rating she again accused me ""You awarded two contracts without funding."" I did not and I could not have awarded any contract as I was not a contracting officer. She was the one who awarded the contracts without checking for adequate funding.  In the letter she stated On 11 October 1991 I met with you to discuss your minimally successful performance.  That was when she accused me of awarding two contracts without funding.  Many times Ms. Reaume and Mr. Horton blamed me for other workers' mistakes.  For example I prepared a contract solicitation document. The staff members including Ms. Reaume had reviewed and approved it. She then forwarded it to the Navy Engineering Field Activity Northwest (EFANW) in Poulsbo WA for a bid process.  The EFANW returned it to her saying the enclosures (1) Specifications and (2) Quality Assurance Plans had too many errors for a bid. Someone in the Plan Estimate Office and Dale Blattman in Contracts prepared the enclosures respectively. However in her memo Ms. Reaume said ""Because of Ken's errors the bid process had to be rescheduled and I had to redo it at night.""  She accused me of altering the Government estimate saying This was a direct violation of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and of the Procurement Integrity Act.  I only changed the Government estimate to compare to the contractor's proposed number in the same unit. Also according to the Justice Department Website the Procurement Integrity Act prohibits the release of source selection and contractor bid or proposal information. If I violated this law she should have called the FBI as she did on Mr. Deven.  She did not even talk to me about these allegations before she had given me the marginal performance rating.  Because my performance rating had fallen below the satisfactory level the Shipyard instruction 12430.4A dated August 27 1991 required Ms. Reaume to provide me with a performance improvement plan (PIP). However instead of doing it she had assigned me to Mr. Horton and began scrutinizing my work for an unsatisfactory performance rating for May 1992.  Realizing how Ms. Reaume was treating me Ms. Dolores Pommier suggested talking to a former GS-11 supervisor who happened to be a Hispanic-American. One day Jerry Neve who had worked for the man took me to his home.  According to Mr. Mel Deven he walked off his job in disgust because Ms. Reaume had called the FBI and reported he was getting kickbacks from a contractor. She did this cowardly act when Mr. Deven bought a car.  Ms. Reaume listened to the other workers' complaints but she could not accept the minor queries from the racial minority employees. Her actions speak louder than words.  My notes would reveal that every 1102 made some mistakes. Some 1102s had ignored the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and skipped required item (s) in their contract documents because of the extensive contract regulations rules and time constraints. However Ms. Reaume scrutinized only my work. I had once told her you know the others are making mistakes too! but she said Dont worry about the others!  Not expecting Ms. Reaumes lies to snowball the retaliation for escalating and last for so many years I did not start taking notes until January of 1992.  Because of Ms. Reaumes blatant lies and differential treatment between the other 1102s and myself I had contacted my Union representative who suggested contacting the Shipyard EEO Office.  January 15 1992. As my Union representative suggested I called the Shipyard EEO Office to make an appointment.  January 28 1992. Tommy (Horton) informed me of an EEO appointment at 0900 on January 30 1992.  Working for Mr. Horton was nothing but frustrations. My notes would show that almost every day I reminded him to process my paperwork so that I could meet my deadlines.  On January 28 1992 I attended Dale Blattman's meeting with a contractor. In March Mr. Horton accused me of allowing Dale Blattman to make an unauthorized commitment. He did not. Because I did not stop Dale from making the unauthorized commitment Mr. Horton used this reason in my unsatisfactory performance rating in May. He did nothing to Dale Blattman. Many of Mr. Hortons employees made unauthorized commitments but he did nothing to them.  January 30 1992. EEO meeting with Cathy Higdon. As she suggested to ask my supervisor in writing I gave Tommy a note asking how I could improve my performance from minimally successful to a satisfactory rating. I also gave Kyle a copy. However they never responded to my requests.  January 30 1992. After my Union representative had met with Ms. Reaume and Mr. Horton I asked her What did they say? She told me You have four letters of complaint. I said What letters? She was surprised that I did not know about them. I never heard or saw any letters of complaint at all. My Union representative also told me that Tommy said 99% of my work is defective. Being an engineer he did not know much about contracting.  On February 3 1992 Mr. Horton had given me a note that said ""Ken. You have a meeting at 8:00 February 5 1990 (1992) w/Cathy of EEO at her office."" Ms. Higdon ridiculed me saying ""they are shaken up because you came to the EEO Office.""  Mr. Hicks said that I filed several complaints with Union but none have resulted in action. He also stated ""... he did not accurately describe the events in 1991. His union grievance failed to gain the relief he was seeking. He then converted the complaint to an EEO complaint. This complaint also failed to provide the relief he requested.""  I had talked to my Union representative but never filed any grievance.  February 7 1992. I heard a rumor that the management is going to give me an unsatisfactory performance rating and get rid of me. This rumor came from Jim Bowron who is a very good fishing friend of Dale Blattman's. Dale is Ms. Reaumes brother-in-law.  February 25 1992. Ms. Reaume told my Union rep that I threatened her by saying Ill get you! If I threatened her I wonder why she did not call the Shipyard Police or the FBI?  February 27 1992. Busy day. I had to finish the post-negotiation memo so that Tommy and Kyle can sign.  Tommy wrote remarks on my post-negotiation memo and I had changed it right away and resubmitted it.  Mr. Horton wrote in more info on the post-negotiation document that I resubmitted. I said I would redo but he said he would submit it just like that. I said OK. Im very sure hes documenting my work now. (I was correct)  Although Ms. Reaume was no longer my supervisor she and Mr. Horton asked Dale and me for the meeting minutes to add another fake reason in my unsatisfactory rating.  Because they were documenting my work for an unsatisfactory performance rating in the upcoming annual performance evaluation I decided to leave Contracts for another shipyard job.  March 17 1992 I had asked Mr. Horton for a supervisor's supplemental performance appraisal that I needed to apply for the job. Immediately after I had left his office I saw Mr. Horton talking to Ms. Reaume and Mr. Hicks.  March 20 1992.  Cheryl (Reaume) is very friendly but I know (I see often) she is telling Tommy what to do about my error or work performance.  March 24 1992. The supervisor's supplemental performance appraisal that I received to apply for another shipyard job said I was a GS-5 level worker. I could not use it. I told Mr. Horton ""I guess I know what I'm getting for the performance rating in May?"" He told me he's documenting all the things since February.  He said I never talked to him about my performance problem. I said you supposed to tell me if Im not doing good enough. He said ""Don't you know by what I'm getting?"" He told me that I didnt prepare a pre-negotiation position (PNP) for equitable adjustment and let Dale negotiate the prices during the meeting on January 28 1992.  To refute Mr. Hortons baseless allegations:  On January 30 1992 I gave notes to Mr. Hicks and Mr. Horton as Kathy of the EEO Office suggested me to do. In my notes I had asked them how I could improve my work performance from minimally satisfactory to fully satisfactory but I never heard anything from them.  As for the pre-negotiation position (PNP) the post-negotiation memo of February 27 1992 indicates The Government Pre-negotiation Position (PNP) enclosure (5) was prepared and approved on 12 February 1992.  Dale did not make an unauthorized commitment as Mr. Horton blamed because Dale had stated ""All the items discussed are subject to approval by the Contracting Officer"" in the meeting minutes.  Anyone especially those who completed the contract law class to think this was an unauthorized commitment is ridiculous. If it was an unauthorized commitment why not discipline Dale? This fake accusation was just another reason to give me a bad performance rating in May.  March 26 1992. 07:42 This morning I had to remind Tommy of FXs 91 and 92 and PNP for P00034. I told him that I needed them this morning especially FX91 because the new Childcare Center wants strip and wax done tonight. He understood.  March 30 1992. 07:37. I asked Tommy about a PNP. I told him I needed it and that I have today and tomorrow to finish negotiation and to prepare a modification. He said he was going to do it on Friday but didnt want to give it to Kyle who was in a bad mood. Also I told him I needed FX92. He said hell do it this morning. I received the PNP FX92 and others this morning. It was about time he gave them back to me. I need all the others as well.  On several occasions I had to go through a pile of documents on Mr. Horton's desk with him so that he could process my papers. In one instance there was a schedule of deductions document that I had given him three months ago. It was very frustrating and I wondered whether he was delaying my documents on purpose.  April 20 1992. Mr. Horton also told me that he is setting up a performance improvement plan (PIP) for me. The PIP was to comply with the Shipyard Instruction for the marginal performance rating that Ms. Reaume had given me in December of 1991. It was the first time ever anyone mentioned it. (However he never showed it to me.)  I then asked about my WGI (within-grade increase). He said Im way below what Im doing. I said Union Agreements require a 30-day written notice in advance of denial. He said No. Five days before denial. I did not argue. I talked to my Union representative about it. Subsequently she had found I was correct and spoke to Mr. Horton.  Because he did not submit the paperwork to deny my step increase on time the Shipyard overpaid $41.60 and I had to pay back this amount later.  Citing my poor performance he denied my participation in the Asian/Pacific Islander EEO Committee.  April 23 1992. Ever since my Union rep talked with Tommy about my WGI denial Tommy is very busy documenting my work. Every time I go into his office to ask a question he abruptly hides something. I dont understand why he does not discuss it with me if I make a mistake. Other 1102s are making mistakes too but nobody is documenting their mistakes as Tommy does mine.  May 6 1992. Dolores told me that she could not take stop-work-order deductions for Oct-Dec from the contractor invoice because a (contract) modification has not been signed. I asked Tommy again to process the Modification P00036 right away (so that Dolores could take the deductions). He said nothing.  On May 14 1992 Joan Willa 1102 who had attended a staff meeting that they did not allow me to participate told me that the new janitorial contract would be given to someone else.  The staff asked what Ken Kenmochi was going to do? The management told the staff that they could not tell yet. At the time the management was planning to establish two GS-5 positions in the Plan Files Issues in Building 443. I believed that the supervisors intended to downgrade me and force me to take one of the two billets.  On May 15 1992 Mr. Horton notified me of an unsatisfactory performance rating. Among others he told me ""till February you were performing satisfactorily"" and ""December through January no discrepancies."" He suggested a GS-5 position in Bldg. 443 far away from Contracts but I did not accept it.  On Monday May 18 1992 Mr. Horton and I met again. He again told me ""from December - February my work is though some mistakes satisfactory. However overall rating through December - March is unsatisfactory."" He told me ""You took a nosedive beginning in February 1992."" I told him I should be treated like anyone else. He said ""Am I treating you differently?""  Instead of complying with the Shipyard Instruction to provide a performance improvement plan (PIP) the management had spent a lot of time to document my work for the poor performance rating in retaliation that had began when I contacted the Shipyard EEO Office on January 28 1992.  Dated May 18 1992 I received the official letter of unsatisfactory performance rating. I was shocked to read many lies in this poor performance rating.  Despite documented as enclosure (5) in the post-negotiation memo of February 27 1992 Mr. Horton accused me of not finishing the pre-negotiation position document on time.  He also said that the negotiation had to be delayed to the last workday on the 25th of February. That was because I did not receive the funding until the 24th. Also the last workday of February 1992 was not the 25th! It was the 28th!  Instead of providing me with a required PIP Ms. Reaume had assigned me to Mr. Horton an engineer and at the same time disallowed me to attend the staff meetings and in-house training. The management then began documenting my work for an unsatisfactory performance rating for May 1992. They also denied my wish to leave Contracts for another shipyard job by giving me a poor supervisor's supplemental performance appraisal. Furthermore Mr. Horton had told me he was documenting all the things since February when I contacted the shipyard EEO Office.  Despite the above the following is what they said to me in the unsatisfactory performance rating.  ""If you fail to demonstrate at least Minimally Successful performance during this trial period or if your performance deteriorates again action may be taken to reassign you to another position demote you to a lower grade position or to remove you from the rolls of the Shipyard.""  ""The Shipyard has an Employee Assistance Program to assist employees whose job performance may be affected by some personal problems. If you would like I will arrange for an appointment for you with a counselor.  This disgusting performance rating was almost a mirror image of the marginal performance rating that Ms. Reaume had given me in December 1991. She had the propensity to make up stories and these gross accusations made me sick to my stomach. I had to break away and rest.  As with Ms. Reaume Mr. Horton never talked to me about these allegations before May 15 1992.  The Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) period was for 60 days from May 18 1992 but after the second or third PIP session I had to remind Mr. Horton of the meeting.  May 20 1992. Tommy had come over and told me to sit in the C/462 staff meeting. I said Am I invited? He said Yes. Youre a contract specialist (1102).  Now that they had given me the unsatisfactory performance rating they allowed me to attend the staff meetings but still Ms. Reaume did not allow me to participate unless they involved an in-house training.  May 29 1992. This afternoon Cheryl Reaume sat at Wes desk and called the EEO. She talked loud enough for the others around to hear. She then made an appointment with the EEO and went there (Terry drove her). Soon after (Ms. Reaume returned) she called Xxxx into Kyles office and talked with Kyle and Tommy present.  June 4 1992. Eddie and I had lunch in the 850A cafeteria. I told him that Tommy had written me up for Dales unauthorized commitment in my unsatisfactory performance rating. He told me Dave G Don E and Dee Bush did unauthorized commitment many times. They promoted Dave G to GS-11 about a month ago. They had all worked for Mr. Horton but Tommy did nothing to them.  June 5 1992 Kyle Hicks told us at all-hands meeting that he will not sign any more unauthorized commitments.  June 15 1992. Dale Blattman agreed with the janitorial contractor to use an old schedule of deductions which resulted in a $3000 loss to the government. His agreement was an unauthorized commitment.  On this day Mr. Horton had hit his desk hard and yelled at me ""Go to the EEO Office or Union if you wanna talk about Dale's unauthorized commitment!"" I asked him politely ""What did you say?"" He had hit the desk again and repeated it for me.  June 30 1992 13:15. Reminded Tommy of a weekly PIP meeting. I said Tommy are we gonna have a meeting? On? he said. A weekly meeting. We didnt have it yesterday. Oh yeah. Yesterday was Monday. At your convenience I told him. OK. I have five things going on now He replied.  All he wanted to know was to find out what I did and what Ill need to do. These meetings benefited him more than me.  The subsequent meetings consisted of Mr. Horton asking me Are there any questions and me replying No."" These meetings took less than ten seconds. There was no PIP schedules written guidelines instructions or any other plans to improve my performance or anything that shows the results of the PIP meetings. Once I quit reminding him of the weekly PIP meeting nothing ever happened.  Ms. Reaume nor Mr. Hicks could not have expected Mr. Horton who had completed only Contract Law class to retrain me who finished all the required training and more. I scored 97s on Contract Law and Cost Price Analysis Classes. I know someone who had to retake and someone else who had to have a remedial class to graduate from the Cost Price Analysis Course. If my performance was an issue why would they assign me to an engineer and bar me from attending the staff meetings and in-house training? Because I did not take a GS-5 position they continued to scrutinize my work.  As the Contracts Director Mr. Hicks was supposed to prevent the hostile-work-environment from happening but instead he participated in it.  After I had received the unsatisfactory performance rating I filed an EEO complaint about retaliation and discrimination in June 1992. However thinking that they received my message I withdrew it. I was wrong.  The following is the management response to the EEO Counselor before I withdrew my complaint.  "" but the complainant continued to demonstrate poor performance. Management attempted to work with the complainant by moving him to a different supervisor (Mr. Horton) but there was little change. The difference between the complainant and other specialists is considerable. The complainant makes fundamental mistakes and fails to learn from the errors. ...""  In their Affidavits of January 28 1997 Ms. Reaume and Mr. Hicks testified that my EEO complaint ""was dismissed"" when in fact I withdrew it.  Ms. Reaume disallowed me to attend the staff meetings and in-house training. She was the one who gave me the marginal performance rating which contained nothing but lies. Ms. Reaume was the one who had called the FBI and reported Mel Deven was getting kickbacks when he bought a car. Also she blocked my desire to leave Contracts for another shipyard job by giving me the lousy supervisors supplement performance rating  Below are excerpts from Ms. Reaume's January 28 1997 Affidavit.  ""In my opinion Ken does not have the business acumen to perform the duties of a contract specialist. ...He does not have the personnel skills to deal with contractors and co-workers. He did not demonstrate an ability to make sound business decisions. He also had difficulty learning from mistakes and refused constructive criticisms.  In my opinion his performance was closer to that of a Purchasing Agent or a Buyer GS-5/7. The telephone contracting that Ken accepted in 1993 (1992) was well within his capabilities.""  Around the middle of September 1992 Ms. Reaume and Mr. Hicks approached and asked me whether I was interested in a contracting officer job in the Telephone Office. I asked ""What grade?"" ""GS-11. Otherwise I wouldn't be asking"" Mr. Hicks said.  I was delighted to leave Contracts and told her I would take it. In no way was I going to refuse the offer knowing I would face more hostile treatment possibly worse than what I had experienced until this time. After all I had tried to leave Contracts for another shipyard job but Ms. Reaumes poor supervisor's supplemental performance appraisal prevented me from applying for the job.  Interestingly Mr. Horton my immediate supervisor did not come but Ms. Reaume did. Mr. Hicks looked guilty and let Ms. Reaume talk. He then left without saying a word. She told me that the GSA wanted a warranted (certified) contracting officer to administer their contract and that I was most qualified.  On July 22 1999 during the EEOC Hearing she testified she was not directory involved in offering the telephone contracting job to me.  Because I did not take the GS-5 position far from Contracts nor walk out of the gate as Mel Deven did this was her last retaliatory action to get rid of me from Contracts all because of a minor complaint in the past fall and my EEO activity in February 1992.  At this time all 1102s were GS-11s. I had no idea Mr. Hicks was going to promote the other 1102s hire more and then eventually promote all of them to GS-12s while I was in the Telephone Office alone or soon after I returned to Contracts.  On October 20 1992 Mr. Horton gave me a fully successful performance rating. He also authorized the step increase as well as the participation in the Asian/Pacific Islander EEO Committee.  As I waited for my contracting officer certificate to arrive I worked the telephone contracting in Contracts for about a month without any problem. Therefore Ms. Reaume did not have to isolate me in the Telephone Office.  In November 1992 Ms. Reaume came over alone. She had given me the contracting officer certificate and told me spitefully ""Move to the Phone Office!""  The letter that came with the Contracting Officer Certificate said not to be issued to an employee who received an unsatisfactory performance rating. It also said the Certificate was to be rescinded upon a transfer. Ms. Crystal Corey who signed the Certificate did not know the facts that I had received the poor performance rating and that the management was reassigning me to the Telephone Office. Additionally I was supposed to report to an 1102 supervisor.  Mr. Hicks' testimony: ""Ken had performance problems and was on PIP prior to accepting the telephone contracting. He also seemed to have strained relations with his former supervisors. The telephone contracting appeared to be solution to some of his problems.""  The Telephone Office was approximately 100 feet away from Contracts. Reporting to electrical engineers I spent two years in the Phone Office alone. My primary responsibility was to procure new telephone systems to replace the leased AT&T telephone equipment for the Shipyard and others. I also issued many other orders to move the existing telephone equipment and other communication equipment. My work was very demanding and my orders amounted to more than a million dollars. Eventually I developed CTS and tendinitis.  Ms. Reaume left Contracts in February 1993 for EFANW. To fill her vacant position Mr. Hicks hired Ms. Audrey Fitzgerald who arrived in June 1993. Mr. Horton returned to the Public Works Engineering Department sometime before I returned to Contracts in October 1994.  In 1993 while I was in the Phone Office Mr. Hicks promoted the other GS-11 contract specialists (1102s) to GS-12s. He had hired more 1102s and eventually promoted all of them to GS-12s. I was more qualified in experience and had a higher level of education than most if not all of these 1102s. Mr. Hicks nor Ms. Fitzgerald told me anything about these job openings. I was upset but I did not want to go back to Contracts so soon after the horrible treatment between November 1991 to November 1992.  One day John Duncan came to see me. Without greetings the first thing he said was Audrey is terrible! in a disgusted voice.  John had told me he was leaving because of how badly Ms. Fitzgerald had been treating him and said he had gone to the EEO Office to complain. The reaction by the EEO Office staff he told me was Not Kyle Hicks again. I was glad he went to the EEO Office because it is there for everyone. I told him Im glad Im here.  A GS-12 contract administrator on the east coast until his office went through restructuring; he took a downgrade to GS-11 at Contracts. He had a master's degree and was a gentle person.  Here is what Ms. Fitzgerald told an EEO Investigator on January 28 1997.  John Duncan left shortly after I arrived. I believe that I may have contributed to Johns decision to quit. He was incompetent. He had a bad temper and did not give me the respect due a supervisor. He had difficulties dealing coworkers. He was unable to keep up with his workload. Prior to his decision to quit I had told him that I was considering placing him on PIP.  After he left Jim Bowron and Marv Emmons told me that Ms. Fitzgerald had forced him out because he had a master's degree.  In October 1994 Mr. Steve Houser the Telephone Office manager and my supervisor asked me to return to Contracts because the Phone Office was moving downstairs. There was not enough space for all the Phone Office staff to occupy.  When I told Ms. Fitzgerald I'm going to have to come back to Contracts she had flatly said ""There's no place for you to sit in Contracts!"" as she walked away. The desk which I moved to later was readily available.  While Ms. Fitzgerald was in a Seattle hospital to remove a tumor from her head Mr. Hicks told me ""Its illegal for you to report to a non-contracting officer. You need to come back to Contracts because theres an audit team coming from Washington D.C. in November. They want to know who the contracting officers reported to."" He told me to take that empty desk on the other side of Audrey's office.  Regarding Ms. Fitzgerald's comment ""there's no place for you to sit in Contracts"" Mr. Hicks testified ""It's true that when we had advised him that he would be reassigned to contracts there was not a vacant desk in that area. We did not have a physical location for him at that time."" Ms. Fitzgerald testified ""There was no vacant desk for two to four months until we received new furniture.""  So where did I sit until the new furniture arrived seven months later in May 1995? Instead of denying her comment they lied in cahoots. Subsequently they both testified that I moved back to Contracts in October 1994.  Dated 17 February 1995 Commander Gross the Assistant Public Works Officer had issued an order to  transfer the Facilities and Maintenance Department Telephone Management Office from Code 992.3 to the Contracts Division less Steve Houser and Ron Cammers.  Since work performed by the Telephone Management Office is predominantly contractual in nature this transfer will ensure proper oversight and management of this function.  The other 1102s worked with Quality Assurance Evaluators (QAE) or inspectors. I was the only 1102 without an inspector. Despite CDR Gross order and my requests they never assigned an inspector. Instead Mr. Hicks and Ms. Fitzgerald testified that the inspector for the telephone contracting remained in the Telephone Office. Because they failed to assign an inspector the Telephone Office staff accepted whatever the contractor billed the government.  Despite CDR. Gross memo Mr. Hicks testified I was never given written delegated authority.  Because of my CTS and tendinitis I often visited the Shipyard Clinic and then-the Group Health Cooperative. Although Ms. Fitzgerald and Mr. Hicks were aware of my medical issues they failed to accommodate for my medical problems.  In February 1995 I received a letter of appreciation from Commanding Officer Naval Legal Service Office Northwest. Dated November 28 1994 she submitted the letter to the Shipyard Commander who then forwarded it to Capt. Knoll then-the Public Works Officer. Capt. Knoll had endorsed the letter on January 30 1995 and sent it to Mr. Hicks.  In February 1995 someone left Capt. Knoll's endorsement letter in my in-basket. Two small yellow stickies attached to it said ""Ken. Good job. Kyle."" Subsequently Ms. Fitzgerald tossed the original letter of appreciation on my desk saying ""here you go"" and left.  She had sent emails to other employees and congratulated them on sick leave they saved. She also formally presented gifts to the other 1102s at a staff meeting.  Both Mr. Hicks and Ms. Fitzgerald initially denied seeing the letter. However during the EEOC Hearing when my attorney showed it to Mr. Hicks he said ""I'm sure I saw it but I just don't remember it.""  Ms. Fitzgerald testified ""I did not know about its existence until he brought it to my attention."" I did not. She blamed ""The public works officer's secretary would bring up letters directly and supervisors would not get copies.  This was not the only episode that we had. There were others as well. And then she was talked to and it was agreed that it would go through the supervisors. And it just wasn't with contracts. It was with engineering and the other groups in public works as well.  Ms. Fitzgerald also made up a lie using Jim Bowron as the person who had made a derogatory comment towards me.  Sometime before the summer of 1995 Dale Blattman GS-12 supervisor placed coffee grounds in a fan in the wall between Ms. Fitzgeralds office and my desk. After the August incident it blew the coffee grounds again in October. As I found out later Brent told Ms. Fitzgerald to turn the fan on. I did not care about this childish prank but because Brent Hardin and Ms. Fitzgerald lied in cahoots I included the October incident in my complaint.  Ms. Fitzgerald testified ""Brent meant to target Marv Emmons who was standing at Ken's desk. However missed Marv and hit Ken.""  Having been through the hostile-work-environment and knowing Mr. Hicks and Ms. Fitzgerald were promoting all the other 1102s to GS-12s I was not in the mood to laugh as Ms. Fitzgerald and Brent Hardin testified. I did not know Brent was watching me getting rid of the coffee grounds from my hair. There were no other people with me and Ms. Fitzgerald did not come over as she testified she did.  Around November 1995 there were rumors of a RIF coming in February 1996.  On November 7 1995 I found out the management promoted the last GS-11 Contract Specialist to GS-12. This individual had less than three years of experience as 1102 compared to more than ten years of mine. Unlike myself she had not completed all the required contracting classes.  On November 9 1995 after the end of work I sent Ms. Fitzgerald an email regarding my promotion. In my email I indicated that I wanted to keep our communication open so that we could solve this promotion issue within Contracts.  Before I left Ms. Fitzgerald had seen the email and called me in her office. When I asked about my promotion she told me Youre doing a GS-5 level work! I protested. She then told me she couldn't do anything because I was in the Phone Office. When I asked ""What about my previous experience as a GS-11?"" She snapped ""I don't know! I wasn't here!"" I could not believe what she had told me and how she said it. Her tone of voice was very demeaning.  On March 7 1996 Julie the new GS-12 said I made stupid mistakes and they are not catching them.  She had sent the funding request and asked to backdate it to match her modification date. It was April 14 1997 and she did not establish the contract until April 3 1997 although its effective date was April 1 1997. Her action was a violation of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  Regarding Julie's promotion Ms. Fitzgerald testified this way. ""She was performing beautifully. She had what -- She had some past experience that dovetailed very very nicely with the existing position. She had a past history with the financial group so she fully understood numbers and reconciling things and trends and things along those lines. She wrote beautifully absolutely beautifully."" Mr. Hick also testified similarly.  I withdrew my last EEO complaint about retaliation that I had filed in June 1992. This time I wanted to hear from Ms. Fitzgerald so that we could solve my promotion issue within Contracts. However because I did not hear anything from her for almost a month I had gone to the EEO Office on December 4 1995 and initiated a complaint.  On February 23 1996 I filed a formal complaint. However I had no problem withdrawing my complaint anytime if they offered some solution.  On December 6 1995 there was a weekly staff meeting for the Codes 910C.1 and 910C.2 in the Public Works Conference Room. One of the topics discussed at the meeting was the recreational funding for Contracts. Initially the staff decided to allocate the funding to four different codes within Contracts based on the number of employees in each section.  Subsequently there was a discussion about whether to combine the recreational funds for Codes 910C.1 and 910C.2. However we could not decide on this issue and Ms. Fitzgerald suggested we take a vote. We agreed. Before the voting she said something I did not understand and so I asked her to repeat. In her reply she said Ken. You're the only minority. Your vote doesn't count anyway.  Shocked I wrote down what she said in my notebook. Although I had felt very awkward to vote because she just told me my vote does not count I chose a yes. Jim Bowron the fund custodian who sat next to me was the only no vote. Ms. Fitzgerald was aware I went to the EEO Office only two days ago.  On December 15 1995 I was faxing my orders to a contractor. Cindy Lingel 1102 had approached and without checking complained that I used all the memory in the fax machine. Because I was sensitive to Ms. Fitzgeralds repeated verbal abuses I just had pulled my documents out of the device and told her Why cant you use a fax machine in Engineering? She did not like it and an argument ensued but it lasted only perhaps 15 to 20 seconds. As I argued I retreated to my desk and Cindy took over the machine.  Mr. Hicks gave a mongoose picture (the second one) to Cindy. He typed on it ""Recognizing Code 910C's obligation to provide excellent customer service; Ms. Lingel shares a few thoughts with Mr. Dick Grant.""  Along with Dale and Brent Cindy was one of the few who had access to Ms. Fitzgerald before her first cup of coffee every morning. Cindy also went to see Ms. Fitzgerald when she was in a Seattle hospital to remove a tumor from her head.  Hearing the argument Ms. Fitzgerald came out of her office. She and I then had gone into her office where she checked my documents. Telling me I should not use the fax machine because my orders tie up the fax machine she told me to mail my orders. I said I dont know why Im being treated this way just because I do the telephone contacting. If I see somebody using the fax machine I will go to the Engineering Office to fax.  During the argument I asked her what she meant by saying you have great potential to be a valuable team member in her email dated November 29 1995. She told me Youre not a team member because youre not doing things other contact specialists are doing! If theres a desk audit youll be downgraded to GS-7! I said Please do it! Please! She did not respond. Mr. Hicks who was on the phone in his adjacent office came in. To calm me down he said Ken. Audrey came to me about your business clearance.  Because of her relentless verbal abuse I demanded to go on mental distress leave. I wrote ""due to discrimination!"" on my leave request.  Before I left work she wanted to know where the taxi service contract was which was on my desk. Later I learned she gave it to Cindy Lingel who awarded the contract.  The following month was the most challenging time emotionally that I had ever had in my entire life. I spent most of my time in bed without much sleep. I still struggle to get over the abusive experiences today.  The following is an excerpt from the interview report of Ms. Carolyn Jenkins the Shipyard Deputy EEO Officer regarding the fax machine incident:  ""In regards to the allegation in paragraph 1 b your supervisor (Ms. Fitzgerald) said your co-worker Cindy's contract (Hazardous Waste) was a priority and needed to be faxed out ahead of yours. Your supervisor said you had 37 pages to fax and that half of it was not time-sensitive. Your co-workers' contract was extremely time-sensitive.""  Ms. Fitzgerald nor Mr. Hicks checked Cindy's documents before I left work. I was already using the fax machine as Ms. Fitzgerald testified ""I became aware that there was a problem when I heard Cindy the female employee was saying you've maxed out the memory. You're always doing this.""  Dated August 3 1995 Capt. Yount issued Harassment in the Workplace a part of which stated: Threatening or harassing conduct is to result in immediate administrative and/or disciplinary action and include removal and criminal prosecution""  After making derogatory and threatening comments repeatedly Ms. Fitzgerald sent me to a two-day ""Developing Good Working Relationships"" class at Submarine Base Bangor because of my rudimentary interpersonal skills according to her. Lesson learned. Ms. Fitzgerald should have attended this class.  Regarding Ms. Fitzgerald's derogatory remark at the staff meeting ""Ken. You're the only minority. Your vote doesn't count anyway"" I met with Ms. Carolyn Jenkins the Deputy EEO Officer on December 19 1995. I had given a letter and asked her to include the comment in my EEO complaint which I initiated on December 4 1995.  After she had read my letter Ms. Jenkins said ""There's a problem. She registered as a (southeast Asian.)""  Sometime later Brent Hardin told me ""Her (Ms. Fitzgerald's) father was in the Air Force and stationed in the Philippines. Every Christmas she goes home in Sacramento.""  While examining the documents I discovered someone altered Ms. Fitzgeralds race from Asian/Pacific Islander to white.  On January 28 and October 10 1997 she testified to the EEO Investigators her race as ""white"" and ""Caucasian"" respectively. She also falsely testified ""no prior EEO complaint activity"" even though I filed a formal complaint against her on February 23 1996.  Because I went on leave on December the 15th Mr. Hicks assigned Marv Emmons to the telephone contracting in January 1996. Although Mr. Hicks and Ms. Fitzgerald had testified that they assigned Marv in November 1995 to help me the telephone order log shows Marv started on January 5 1996. Marv also told me ""sometime in January '96"" when I asked him ""When did you start helping me?""  I did not know Marv was working on the telephone contracting until he called me at home. He had told me ""you made your point"" and asked me to return to work. I could not believe it because he was GS-12 and had been doing nothing until now.  Because of my CTS Marv Emmons GS-12 typed the orders for me to sign. Until this time Mr. Hicks did not give Marv anything to do although he could have helped any 1102 who had heavy workloads. As a result Marv sat around all day long doing nothing. Mr. Hicks and Ms. Fitzgerald falsely testified Marv eventually took over the telephone contracting. My notes show otherwise.  As a part of the upcoming Shipyard RIF Mr. Hicks and Ms. Crystal Corey of the EFANW established the ""Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) whose negotiation began in November 1995. Except for Marv Emmons and me Ms. Corey and Mr. Hicks agreed to take all the 1102s to the EFANW in Poulsbo WA. Physically they remained in the same office at the Shipyard.  In retaliation to my EEO activity and because my veteran's rights would have RIFd another 1102 that Mr. Hicks had wished to take to the EFANW he abolished my permanent veteran position illegally in January 1996.  According to the MoA Mr. Hicks and Ms. Corey completed identifying which 1102s to transfer to the EFANW on January 25 1996. This list excluded Marv Emmons and me but There were two (2) vacancies in the 1102 numbers.  On the same day January 25 1996 Mr. Hicks sent an email to Ms. Fitzgerald saying See attached. I also put it on disk for your enjoyment. I suspected this attachment had the names of 1102s going to EFANW without Marv Emmons and me.  According to the EEO Counselor Report of February 20 1997 Mr. Hicks stated ""... the complainant (Ken) was a Contract Specialist at that time. He (Mr. Hicks) did not have anyone who was performing Contract Administrator work and when he saw this position he targeted it for abolishment.""  This contract specialist billet Mr. Hicks referred to was a temporary position. Since the RIF targeted only the permanent positions this temporary billet would not have been on the list of jobs subject to the RIF.  Additionally my exceeds fully satisfactory performance ratings of July 1995 and May 1996 showed Contract Administrator. Mr. Hicks and Ms. Fitzgerald signed both ratings. He was aware of my veteran status but he did not know what my job title was?  According to Mr. Hicks' Affidavit of October 10 1997 ""Ken was the only veteran with veteran retention rights on the C/910C staff for 1102's with the exception of myself. Abolishing his position specifically would have made no sense because it would set up a bump and retreat situation. What I am getting at is that I am accused of doing it but I am smart enough not to have done this because it would have only set up this chain reaction.""  According to Mr. Hicks ""Abolishing his position specifically would have made no sense because it would set up a bump and retreat situation."" Not true. The truth was that If he did not abolish my billet it would have created the bump and retreat condition which affected Jan Everheart's position.  Like Mr. Hicks and Terry Tallman I am a Vietnam Era veteran. Enlisting in the USAF was one of the best decisions I had ever made in my life. Serving under the great supervisors and commanders was one of the most privileged and memorable experiences. I am proud of the fact that I received an Air Force Commendation Medal when I was E-3. If I could serve in the Air Force again I would do it without any hesitation.  Capt. Ben Winters and I had organized and trained the Spangdahlem Air Base Ski Team which won the second place in a USAF Europe Ski Championship. I also placed first and second places at several events. Competing in Hintertux Austria I was on the US Air Force Europe Ski Team as well.  February 14 1996. ""Something was going on this morning. I have never seen Audreys face as it was this morning. ... Rumor has it that Dales position is being abolished. Looks like Kyle Audrey and Dale are scrambling about this in the conference room. Later I found out that the Public Works is going to combine the two Compliance Evaluation Branches in Contracts and have one supervisor for the newly combined branch.""  Dale Blattman a very close friend of Mr. Hicks' and Ms. Fitzgerald's became a target of the RIF. To save him from the RIF they had made Terry Tallman Dale's counterpart 1102 and taken him to EFANW along with the other 1102s.  Because Terry Tallman was not qualified to be 1102 I learned he returned to his inspector job after he had gone to EFANW. Mr. Hicks and Ms. Fitzgerald had conspired and testified that Tallman was qualified for 1102.  Regarding the qualification of Terry Tallman Mr. Bob Fojtik testified on October 10 1997 as follows.  All I can comment on are facts that I know. I do know that Terry Tallman was not an 1102 up until just before the transfer out to EFANW. He was made an 1102 and transferred to EFANW with the other I102's except for those performing the telephone function.  November 20 1997. Marv Emmons again said that Kyle told everybody in Contracts how proud he was to save Dale Blattman from losing his job. Jim Bowron also told me Kyle bragged how he saved Dales job from being RIFd at a staff meeting. He told me this at the Lowes in East Bremerton. I believe Jim worked there briefly.  After Marv told Bob Fojtik that Terry Tallman was converted to 1102 before they went to EFANW Bob said ""you guys are really screwed.""  On February 23 1996 less than two months before the RIF that became effective April 14 1996 Ms. Fitzgerald called Marv Emmons and me into Mr. Hicks' office. He told us effective Monday (February 26 1996) we'll be on Bob Fojtik's payroll. He stated that EFA told Mr. Hicks that they only took so many 1102s (and two 1102 openings).The Telephone Office will be under Bob Fojtik's control. . He then said ""I'm sorry I couldn't take all 1102s because I had to take Terry to save Dale"" As soon as he said this Ms. Fitzgerald interrupted ""Shh you can't say that!"" They then started to whisper.  Everyone in Contracts knew I was working the telephone contracting alone until this time. Brent urged me to ""retain a lawyer and fight because they had to know the phone contracting work could not support two employees.""  Many times Mr. Hicks and Ms. Fitzgerald said the phone work was a GS-5/7 level responsibility. Now they assigned Marv Emmons a GS-12 employee and me to perform GS-5/7 level work? If they wanted they could have taken Marv and me as they had two 1102 vacancies. Soon after the RIF became effective on April 14 1996 Mr. Hicks and Ms. Fitzgerald hired Karen Smith.  I thought I was safe but I was wrong again. On March 19 1996 in less than a month after the transfer Mr. Fojtik the new supervisor RIFd me even though I had four years of experience contracting officer certificate and was a vet. Marv Emmons who was a Contract Analyst had less than three months of experience in typing my orders because I had CTS. Additionally the Navy would have saved more money by eliminating the GS-12 position rather than mine.  I also wondered how Brent had obtained this list of the positions to be abolished before anyone else knew and why he showed it to me when Mr. Fojtik my supervisor should have talked to me about it. (I suspected Ms. Fitzgerald gave the list to Brent to find out my reaction.)  Mr. Fojtik had to know that I worked the telephone contracting alone. I filed a complaint about Riffing me instead of Marv Emmons. Because of Mr. Fojtiks retaliation to my EEO activity I ended up as a GS-5 Accounting Technician. Who wants to hire or keep anyone who filed an EEO complaint? I did not believe Mr. Fojtik was aware I was a vet and had a college degree also.  Excerpts from the Shipyard EEO Counselor Report of February 20 1997.  Robert Fojtik stated that when the Complainant and Mr. Emmons were assigned to him he had two contract specialists to do the telephone work. He did not feel that the workload supported two positions and he knew he needed to abolish one. The Counselor asked Mr. Fojtik why he would abolish the Complainant's position when the Complainant states that he has the experience and certifications for performing the telephone contracting. Mr. Fojtik stated If I knew then what I know now my decision may have been different.  Mr. Fojtik explained that when he stated at the meeting he would be abolishing the Complainant's position he was looking to Mr. Hicks for a sanity check"" to make sure he was doing the right thing. Mr. Hicks said nothing. Mr. Hicks was utterly aware the telephone contracting had been my sole responsibility since late 1992.  On April 1 1996 Mr. Fojtik sent an email to Mr. Runquist in Human Resources. He said Code 910 would like to remove from the RIF list the following positions. Mr. Fojtik had reversed four positions and said I will call you tomorrow and explain. I do not want to make a mistake on these. Sorry it has taken so long to get this info.  However riffing my position rather than that of Marv Emmons was not a mistake?  After the RIF and while I had worked in the Business Office as a GS-5 employee I had received several emails from Ms. Pappas the Shipyard Assistant Attorney. Initially they led me to believe the Shipyard was willing to negotiate my EEO complaint. However in one of the subsequent emails she said ""One complaint is enough. You don't want to jeopardize your complaints."" She was suggesting me to drop my complaint about the RIF.  To continue reading click on the link below.",political,Facebook
My name is Bryan Bliss. I am a pro-family candidate announcing my intention to run for the USD 475 School Board. My decision to run is based on my concern about the curriculum being taught to our children across all 50 States of this Great Country.  I have been married to Colleen Bliss for 30 years and have three adult daughters one son in-law and another son in-law in August. I am a career firefighter and live on a small farm east of town that I grew up on. I am a product of the Junction City School District.  I will defend against the advancement of Critical Race Theory 1619 Project excessive political correctness and ideas that look to rewrite our Nations history. As a father of 3 daughters who all competed in school sports I will stand against biological males participating in female sports. It creates a negative atmosphere and takes away self-esteem and opportunities from every girl in our district.  I will stand up for the morals and values of our educators who feel like they must compromise their beliefs to keep their job. My goal is for staff members to know they are backed by their school board so they can come to work feeling appreciated. In turn that change produces a better environment for our students to grow and learn.  I am looking forward to hearing from you and serving our community. I would appreciate your vote this November.

"GREEN NEW DEAL  There is no universally understood definition of what ""the"" Green New Deal proposal is specifically. Broadly we understand it to be a government initiative to invest in jobs and infrastructures that will clean our environment and reduce carbon emissions. The term ""Green New Deal"" was first penned by Green Party activists decades ago and later co-opted by the Democratic Party as a title for several different legislative proposals that have been presented. First it is important to acknowledge that there is no one specific Green New Deal that we can all agree on as the reference point. There are many varying proposals initiatives and concepts identifying themselves as a Green New Deal. With that important distinction acknowledged I wholeheartedly support the general objectives and goals of most Green New Deals that have been proposed. Without necessarily having to proclaim support for an amorphous interpretation of ""THE"" Green New Deal I readily and willingly support any government initiatives that regulate actions that impact the environment that invest in infrastructure jobs and policies that will reduce carbon emissions reverse global warming and protect and clean our environment. Whether a comprehensive package some iteration of a Green New Deal can be passed or whether certain components must be passed individually in piecemeal as a Green Independent I support any and all efforts to improve our environment and protect it from further degradation. In addition to being an advocate for any proposal that is a benefit to our environment there are also some non-environmental topics included in some versions of a Green New Deal -- such as living wages and universal access to health care -- that I also support.",political,Facebook
A citizen recent sent me a list of questions. Here is the list and my replies.  1) What is the identity of Pickens County in your eyes?  Pickens County is a storybook small AMERICAN hometown with a close knit generous and compassionate community. Most everyone is connected and everyone knows each other.  2) What are your goals to further define or change the identity of Pickens county?  I have no interest in changing the identity above. I truly desire to keep it small town without an increase in population. WE need to develop this county in a controlled way and with quality community-based needs. We need to make sure economically we are hiring locally. We need community events and connection opportunities that give off that vibrant & exciting small-town feel. Id like our main entry points to give our community a more rustic look as visitors enter into the North GA Mountains.  3) If you could pick a city as a role model for the future of Pickens county which Georgia city would you pick?  LaGrange. They have gardens parks breweries a first-class amphitheater grassy community space etc. The feel is energetic & exciting while still giving off that small-town feeling. The merchants and small businesses are thriving. Their intergovernmental agreements anti-litter campaigns and comprehensive plans are impressive.  4) How do you plan on implementing your vision for Pickens county with a budget that is limited how do you plan to free up cash or bring more cash in?  I dont think we are as limited as we think. We just need to use the money we have responsibly. Working with the current department heads to trim any fat just as I do now is priority. We need to think outside the box. One way is to become a destination area through Parks and Recreation and other amenities. Little league sports tournaments/complexes are cash cows. You have good people traveling and spending lots of money. Its good for local businesses as visitors need food drinks hotels VRBO rentals. This really capitalizes on SPLOST. Look at Hoover Alabama they are making a fortune off their sports facilities. I really like the RV Park incorporated into their park design. They paved a big area and made 170 spots available to RVs at $30 a night. They saw something similar to what we have in Pickens. A lot of people traveling through and needing a stopping place to stop and refresh. They stay at 25 percent capacity even when events are not taking place which is 400k in revenue. They also eat out and restock on groceries which brings in more SPLOST revenue. Look at the Tri-State Exhibition Center in McDonald TN. This type facility for car shows horse shows dog shows etc bring people that spend money! I can negotiate and arrange these revenue producers without raising our taxes!  5) What are your top three project goals for the board of commissioners during your term in office?  Wow! Thats a hard one as there is so much to improve on. These are not in order as they are all important. Again there is so much more to make better. First it isnt a project but a must is the transparency fairness and flow of county business. Our local government must be open honest and fluid with our citizens. Every last one of them is our employer. We also have to simplify government and it starts local. Getting a building permit should not be a hard process to figure out. Requesting a pothole to be filled should be a simple click on a computer or smart device. Everyone must be treated equally. 1  Roads Infrastructure and Public Services  We need an inter-city agreement with Jasper regarding sewer if not we might just need to build our own. We need a reservoir TRUMP has relaxed EPA requirements enough to do it now that doubles as water source and recreation area. We have serious road problems in the county needing addressed including some private road issues that need worked out. We need emergency responders in each Fire Station with ambulances. Grandma or little Johnny cant wait 30 minutes for an ambulance. ALL our workers need paid appropriately as we cant afford turnover. Happy employees are key to our success. I consider the animal shelter in this category. We need a new shelter with better areas for the animals to exercise. ABSOLUTELY no kill unless medically warranted and recommended by a vet. 2 - Amenities - Parks and Recreation was already discussed. Our children are going to Cherokee County for aquatics. An aquatic center would be used by or elderly citizens and could be a revenue generator for events. Kids arent playing other sports or they are going to Cherokee or Cobb to play. We need to incorporate activities for non-sports players and citizens with disabilities etc. Greenspace amphitheater dog park and Ag area are all part of my amenities plan. Again I can pull this off without a tax increase. The Pickens County Airport is a huge amenity and asset to this county. It could be the driver of economics. We have heavily invested in an unfinished project. FBO fences lengthen the runway needs to happen. This can be through grants. I am a huge supporter of General Aviation. 3. Economics  If we create the right environment to attract businesses that hire our citizens with career jobs we change our landscape. There are segments of industry that build out of site out of mind but employ a hundred people with top pay. UPS FedEx US Cold Storage are all looking for homes in North Georgia. These buildings are built on a track of land behind landscaping and only need water for their restrooms and dont pollute. This automatically fixes the housing situation as citizens being paid well can all of the sudden afford the house they cant now.,political,Facebook
PASS Parents and Friends Katie here!  I want to introduce PASS to anyone new (welcome!) and to reaffirm our commitment to our core mission for those who have been with us over the years.  WHAT IS PASS? PASS is a 501(c)4 non-profit corporation incorporated in Virginia and located exclusively in Shenandoah County. Its very small budget comes from private contributions. It has a Board of Directors of about 16 people  most of them parents of kids in SCPS at all three campuses in a wide a variety of grade levels to bring division-wide comprehensive perspectives and experiences together.  WHY WAS PASS CREATED? In 2015 a group of parents were concerned with the chronic underfunding of our schools. Our per-pupil spending was the second lowest in our region and our teacher salaries had fallen behind our neighbors. Intensifying matters was the organized and motivated movement actively opposed to spending on the schools that had gained a foothold on the Board of Supervisors the body ultimately responsible for making funding decisions for the county. Year after year our schools were being asked to do more with less. PASS was created to cut through the political narratives and misinformation to educate parents with facts about the budgetary realities of the schools in order to make them better advocates for local education funding and more informed voters at election time. As such PASS does seek to inform voters about how incumbents voted and about where candidates stand on matters related to school funding and the state of local education. While the hard work of getting accurate factual information to the public is our urgent priority our greatest joy is celebrating good news (there is so much good news!) about our schools our kids and the amazingly dedicated people working for SPCS!  HOW BIG IS PASS? PASS does not have formal membership other than our board members. We have almost 1400 people who follow our Facebook page and about 1000 on our e-mail list (we do assume there is overlap between the two).  IS PASS AFFILIATED WITH SCPS THE SCHOOL BOARD OR THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS? No.  DOES PASS ENDORSE CANDIDATES FOR SCHOOL BOARD OR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS? No. PASS could do so if it wanted to but it chooses not to. The corporation does not raise money for candidates though its board members are individually politically active.  DOES PASS TAKE POSITIONS ON EVERY EDUCATION ISSUE? No. We do not take positions on state or federal issues because we feel that those issues divide parents and detract from local focus. We take positions on issues related to local school funding teacher and staff retention and high-impact topics like when we called for additional in-person days last spring. We only take positions when there is consensus among our board members.  We hope this gives you a little background about PASS. We also hope this serves as a reset in the way we move forward on this page. Its easy to get sucked into the destructive environment that persists on social media. That is not what PASS is about. We will move forward with respect in the best interest of keeping you our neighbors in community factually informed about education in SCPS not to add to the already overly hostile environment that is social media. The future of our community depends on quality education. We cannot lose sight of that.  We are more alike my friends than we are unalike.  Maya Angelou  Katie Freakley,political,Facebook
"BEFORE EMBRACING AMERICA-FIRST AGENDA DAVID PERDUE WAS AN OUTSOURCING EXPERT  (Share if you believe that Georgians should know the sad truth about their Senator DA2020)  Mr. Perdue who faces one of two runoff elections in Georgia that will determine control of the Senate built a business record that shifted manufacturing and jobs overseas.  By Stephanie Saul Richard Fausset and Michael LaForgia  Jan. 1 2021 Updated 1:24 p.m. ET  The biographical video from Senator David Perdues first campaign in 2014 celebrated a narrative arc that many fellow Georgians either related to or have aspired to: the story of a humble boy from rural America whose hard work catapulted him into a global business career navigating free markets and faraway lands all the while gathering stores of wisdom and wealth.  The embrace of global commerce has been a hallmark of modern Georgia showcased in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics dissected by the novelist Tom Wolfe and promoted by among others Mr. Perdues Nafta-loving cousin Sonny Perdue governor from 2003 to 2011. Three years later in his maiden run for office David Perdue would boast of his international experience as a consultant and chief executive while speaking to a gathering of Republicans in Bibb County close to his middle Georgia hometown.  Theres only one candidate in this race thats ever lived outside the United States Mr. Perdue said. How can you bring value to a debate about the economy unless you have any understanding about the free-enterprise system and what it takes to compete in the global economy?  Now facing one of a pair of Jan. 5 runoff elections in Georgia that will determine control of the Senate Mr. Perdue has continued to make his global business experience the essence of his brand. But that has highlighted the contradictions that emerge  in his career and in his character but also in his party and his region  as he embraces the populist America-first strains of Trumpism.  The man who has lately voiced support for some of President Trumps signature tariffs built his career as an unapologetic free-trading practitioner of the outsourcing arts. As a top executive at companies including Reebok Sara Lee and Dollar General he was often deeply involved in the shift of manufacturing and jobs to low-wage factories in China and other Asian countries.  A review of that business record shows a man who achieved significant successes making millions managing complex periods of corporate growth and change and creating domestic jobs particularly at Dollar General. But there were also disappointments like the failed trucking business he ran with Sonny Perdue and his fruitless effort to rescue a company called Pillowtex that brought heartbreak to a North Carolina mill town. And while the senator often speaks of having led the Reebok turnaround as president of the companys flagship brand in the early 2000s he moved on from the company after a rival who today questions Mr. Perdues contribution to the turnaround was installed above him.  The man who spent much of his life broadening his horizons took to the stage at a Trump rally in Macon before Election Day and mocked Senator Kamala Harriss first name mispronouncing it with an exaggerated stumble that to critics amounted to crude racism. His campaign has called it an innocent mispronunciation.  The man who dons a faded denim jacket to reinforce his connection to everyday Georgians has a record of aloofness with an aversion to holding town hall meetings and a thin skin for tough questions. Now he has chosen a further withdrawal declining to participate in additional debates after one in which his Democratic opponent Jon Ossoff called him a crook for his prolific stock-trading while in the Senate.  Mr. Perdue did not respond to requests to be interviewed for this article. In response to written questions his campaign issued a statement that said in part Throughout his four decades working in the real world before being elected to the Senate David Perdue led American companies that saved and created tens of thousands of American jobs.  As when he first ran for office six years ago Mr. Perdue who is 71 regularly invokes those decades in business to style himself the ultimate Washington outsider though it was his cousin the former governor who gave him his entree to politics and helped nurture his ascent.  Taking aim at his 33-year-old opponent who runs a London-based documentary film company and has never held public office Mr. Perdues campaign has fixed on a $1000 payment from a Hong Kong media company to charge that Mr. Ossoff had a two-year working relationship with the Chinese Communist Party.  In its statement to The New York Times most of which dwelled on Mr. Ossoff the Perdue campaign called it ridiculous to compare the senators leadership in American companies with Jon Ossoffs foreign-owned company with shady ties to the Chinese government. (Mr. Ossoffs spokeswoman dismissed that claim as one of the most laughable smear campaigns in Georgia history.)  Mr. Perdues campaigns biographical video meanwhile has been refreshed for 2020. Edited out is a section that showed the senator posing with his wife on Chinas Great Wall.  From a Watermelon Patch to the World Mr. Perdue grew up in Warner Robins a small city about 100 miles south of Atlanta home to Robins Air Force Base. Airmen coming and going from foreign deployments connected the city to the wider world.  But life could still move to rural rhythms. Mr. Perdue traces his roots back to nearby Bonaire a farming community where Perdues settled in the early 1800s. Mr. Perdue recalls picking watermelons on a family-owned farm alongside Sonny who would become Mr. Trumps agriculture secretary in 2017.  While farming was a family pursuit Mr. Perdues parents followed a different path  education. David Perdue Sr. eventually became county schools superintendent.  Mr. Perdue would later go on to extol his fathers leadership in desegregating the countys schools but the historical record provides a different picture revealing the school system employed delay tactics until the N.A.A.C.P. sued and a court ordered it to comply.  The future senator graduated from high school in 1968 two years before the schools were fully integrated. Standout student varsity athlete and class president he was awarded a coveted appointment to the Air Force Academy.  David has those personal traits that cause him to be recognized as a person of worth his high school principal Milton Sutherlin wrote in a recommendation letter. His character is that always of a gentleman and he holds high those Christian ideals that speak well of his home training his school and his community.  But while the Air Force would prove a good fit for his cousin Sonny who served three years and was promoted to the rank of captain it was not so for David. He received Bs and Cs in a brief stint at the academy and by early 1969 let it be known that he wanted out.  I have realized that I have made a mistake and I do not want this type of career he wrote in January 1969 to Jack Brinkley the congressman who had sponsored him. His plan was to attend the Georgia Institute of Technology and try to play basketball.  His basketball career never materialized but Mr. Perdue would earn undergraduate and masters degrees at Georgia Tech. And over the next three decades he would position himself on the winning side of a seismic economic shift sweeping the South.  A Global Man of the New South Increasingly and inexorably the regions apparel and textile industry was turning to foreign contractors to manufacture its products. The disruption which meant thousands of layoffs for low-skilled workers in Southern mill towns was Mr. Perdues ticket to the world. He became an expert in outsourcing.  I spent most of my career doing that he would later say in a deposition.  His apprenticeship in outsourcing began while he was still in school. In 1972 he joined Kurt Salmon Associates a consulting company that had earned its reputation sending bright young engineers into Southern clothing factories to solve technical problems and boost efficiency. The company had a large Atlanta office and by the 1970s was aspiring to a more-global footprint.  The city was too. Born as a regional railroad hub Atlanta had begun adding international flights to its growing airport creating yet more opportunities for a metropolis that had already rocketed past its Southern rivals fueled by relentless civic boosterism and a reputation for racial moderation.  William Sand an engineer who worked in the Atlanta office with Mr. Perdue recalled that in the 1970s as Southern factories were beginning to close new ones were opening in Mexico and Asia. Kurt Salmon he said became experts at helping companies source product from overseas.  Mr. Perdue left in 1984 and worked at a few other places before ending up at Sara Lee which was best known for its baked goods but was also an apparel manufacturer. He was hired in 1992 to open a headquarters in Hong Kong where he lived for two years establishing operations throughout Asia from the ground up he would later say.  The ripple effects reached home. In 1994 the company eliminated thousands of jobs including 230 at its Spring City Knitting plant in Cartersville Ga. Most of the workers were women who earned $4.25 an hour sewing garments.  By that time Mr. Perdue was globe-trotting with yet another company Haggar Clothing which had chosen him to lead its international operation with one aim  increasing foreign sourcing. Within three years he had done just that boosting international production from 60 percent to 75 percent. As company plants were closed in the United States workers in Mexico performed the job for $1.50 an hour.  By 1998 Mr. Perdue was headed to Reebok which ultimately promoted him to lead its main division as it forged licensing deals with the National Football League and the National Basketball Association. Major league teams with their star power and marquee players burnished Reeboks cachet leading to its acquisition by Adidas in 2005. The manufacturing of most of the companys products was outsourced primarily to China and elsewhere in Asia.  The 2014 video produced by Mr. Perdues Senate campaign  in which he discusses licensing agreements  portrays him as the architect of Reeboks turnaround. Even in the wake of improvements in the companys business though Reeboks chairman Paul Fireman passed over Mr. Perdue for promotion to the companys No. 2 job.  In December 2001 the company announced that Mr. Perdue who as head of the Reebok brand had reported directly to Mr. Fireman would instead report to Jay Margolis who had formerly headed other brands for the company but was suddenly named chief operating officer.  Paul Fireman decided he wanted one guy to run it all from a C.O.O. point of view said Kenneth Watchmaker Reeboks chief financial officer until 2006. Thats where the two of them competed and Jay got the nod and David left after a period of time.  Mr. Margolis says that he and Mr. Fireman actually pushed out Mr. Perdue who has characterized his departure from Reebok as voluntary. I look back on David. He couldnt make decisions. He was so indecisive he couldnt move the product forward Mr. Margolis said.  As for the licensing deals Mr. Margolis said those were the brainchild of Mr. Fireman.  Mr. Fireman reached by phone said I dont remember firing him. He added: Im not challenging Jays recollection; I just dont remember myself.  Mr. Fireman did not address a question about the extent to which Mr. Perdue was involved in turning around the brands. A long time has passed since then he said. David was a good solid employee for the four or five years he was with me at a high level Mr. Fireman said. And I knew him as a good person.  Within months of Mr. Margoliss promotion Mr. Perdue was in discussions with a headhunter seeking an executive with the know-how and experience to turn around Pillowtex a troubled sheet and towel manufacturer with well-known brands in its portfolio including Cannon Fieldcrest and Royal Velvet.  Leaving behind what he would later describe as $5 million worth of in-the-money unvested Reebok stock options Mr. Perdue agreed in spring 2002 to take the job as chief executive of Pillowtex.  The company was just emerging from bankruptcy and thousands of workers at its home base in Kannapolis N.C. viewed Mr. Perdue as a potential savior according to Scott Shimizu a former executive vice president. Looking back though Mr. Shimizu said he believed Mr. Perdues inaction led to the companys demise.  The company needed to sell off assets quickly and outsource production to survive  with the possibility of retaining part of its United States work force  but Mr. Shimizu says Mr. Perdue took few steps to do either.  He didnt really help us said Mr. Shimizu. We were waiting for him to bring the Ten Commandments to us. They never came.  Mr. Perdue would later say he had been misled about the depth of the companys financial problems including a badly underfunded pension plan. He became embroiled in a dispute with Pillowtex over its failure to live up to the compensation agreement he had negotiated.  The company imploded and about 7650 people lost their jobs most of them in North Carolina. The Charlotte Observer called it the largest mass layoff in state history. The hard feelings toward Mr. Perdue were rife in Kannapolis and in 2014 his Democratic Senate opponent Michelle Nunn would release an ad set there highlighting the bitterness.  Mr. Perdue who had been at Pillowtex less than a year soon found a new opportunity that would also touch large numbers of working-class people: at Dollar General. The company boasts that 25 percent of its products retail for less than $1.  As chief executive Mr. Perdue oversaw the opening of a Hong Kong office in 2004 increasing the global sourcing that helps to provide the low everyday price our customers count on according to a company announcement. Among the global sources were manufacturers in China records show.  Low wages were another way the company controlled costs. Store managers sued the company complaining that they were not paid overtime even though they took on nonmanagerial duties unloading trucks and stocking shelves after hours. Some of their claims as well as legal complaints from female workers who said they were inequitably compensated resulted in payouts.  Dollar General flourished under Mr. Perdues leadership adding more than 2000 stores and expanding the use of coolers to stock more grocery items. Former colleagues who visited Mr. Perdue at the companys Tennessee headquarters said it was apparent he was preparing Dollar General for acquisition. In 2007 Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company announced it would purchase Dollar General for about $7 billion. It was later reported that Mr. Perdue walked away with a $42 million payout.  The Perdue family had lived in Nashvilles tony Belle Meade section but it was time to head back to Georgia where Mr. Perdue would ultimately settle on Sea Island a wealthy sanctuary on the southern coast.  The Outsider In 2010 as Sonny Perdue was finishing his second term as governor he named his cousin David to the board of the Georgia Ports Authority.  About a year later records show the cousins formed a company called Perdue Partners which in December 2012 acquired Benton Express an Atlanta-based trucking company that had operated as a regional family business for nearly 80 years. They renamed it Benton Global and pledged to reinvigorate the business by drawing on overseas connections and especially David Perdues ties to Asia according to press reports and interviews with former employees.  The Perdues installed two loyalists of the former governor in top management positions and oversaw the purchase of new tractor-trailers. But the promised new international business never materialized and the company already suffering from flagging revenues struggled to pay its bills. It closed abruptly in 2015 leaving more than 500 truck drivers clerks and terminal workers unemployed.  As a member of the ports authority board Mr. Perdue voted repeatedly on infrastructure improvements that might have benefited his trucking business The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. A spokesman for Mr. Perdue said at the time that none of the votes posed a conflict of interest or aided Mr. Perdue financially.  In 2013 Georgias senior senator Saxby Chambliss announced that he would not stand for re-election the next year. In David Perdues telling he drove to see his cousin and tried to convince him to run. Well he told me he didnt feel led to do so but then he said I should consider running Mr. Perdue later recalled in an interview.  When Mr. Perdue decided to run he recruited top aides from his cousins campaign staff. Davids team was Sonnys team said Jack Kingston a longtime Republican congressman who also sought the vacant seat. Sonny Perdue he said was very instrumental in his cousins campaign.  For all that David Perdue branded himself the outsider the man with the real-world business savvy needed to effect change. The Republican primary was crowded with well-known and seasoned politicians and Mr. Perdue attacked them for their seasoning portraying them in ads as ineffectual mewling babies.  ""We were hoping that we could find an Achilles heel  hes lazy hes going to say something stupid Mr. Kingston said of the campaign. We found him to be pretty disciplined and hard-working. I have to give him good marks.  After defeating Mr. Kingston in a primary runoff Mr. Perdue went on to face Ms. Nunn an executive at a nonprofit whose father Sam Nunn was a former Democratic senator from Georgia. Though both candidates benefited from famous family names Ms. Nunn thought she might gain the upper hand by focusing on the negative effects of Mr. Perdues embrace of globalism.  A month before the election a transcript surfaced of a nine-year-old deposition in which Mr. Perdue said he had spent most of my career outsourcing. Questioned by reporters Mr. Perdue replied that he was proud of that record. This is a part of American business part of any business he said adding People do that all day.  Ms. Nunn pressed the point in her ads and on the debate stage. But she was the underdog and 2014 proved to be a bad year for Democrats burdened by a lack of enthusiasm for President Barack Obama and his signature legislation the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Perdue blasted Mr. Obamas handling of the Ebola virus crisis and vowed to repeal Obamacare. He practically waltzed to victory.  The outsider arrived on Capitol Hill pushing a term-limit plan and railing against career politicians to the annoyance of his fellow Georgia Republican Senator Johnny Isakson according to two people familiar with the views of Mr. Isakson who had spent many years in politics and was gearing up for a third Senate run.  The record Mr. Perdue built was reliably conservative. He submitted a far-fetched  and critics said regressive  proposal to replace income taxes with sales taxes on goods and services. He proposed limits on the ability of immigrants to sponsor family members instead giving priority to college-educated young people with high-paying jobs.  In the beginning he also spoke and voted as one would expect a free trader to do. In 2015 he voted to give Mr. Obama enhanced powers to negotiate big trade agreements including the Trans-Pacific Partnership the most substantial trade accord since the North American Free Trade Agreement of the 1990s.  But Mr. Perdue was also early to see the potential in Mr. Trump who offered a kind of mirror reflection of Mr. Perdues own political persona as chief executive change agent. The two men reportedly met at Trump Tower during Mr. Perdues 2014 run. And after Mr. Trumps inauguration the senator could be unrestrained in his praise at one point comparing the new president to Winston Churchill. This guy I think is a historic person of destiny at a time and place in America when weve got to make a right-hand turn here Mr. Perdue said.  Mr. Perdue and his fellow Republicans quickly had to grapple with the presidents determination to break the partys mold on global trade. Three days into his tenure Mr. Trump tore up the Trans-Pacific Partnership calling it a rape of our country.  Although Mr. Perdues campaign has said that he consistently supported the presidents America-first trade policies the senator spoke out in 2017 against a Trump-backed plan to impose a border adjustment tax that would have raised taxes on companies that import goods into the United States. A year later he criticized the presidents plan to impose steep tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum calling for a more targeted strategy.  But by late 2019 as Mr. Perdues re-election bid on a ticket with Mr. Trump loomed he seemed more amenable to the presidents approach.  The tariffs are creating the opportunity for people to come to the table he said according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. For the first time in five decades we are standing up to the Chinese and other trading partners around the world and all we want is equal access and a level playing field.  The crosscurrents on trade could be tricky and suddenly Mr. Perdues globalist background made him susceptible to attacks from fellow conservatives. In September 2019 Lou Dobbs the powerful pro-Trump TV personality reported that Mr. Perdue and another senator were visiting Beijing where Mr. Dobbs warned they may well be undercutting U.S. and China trade negotiations and progress made by the president. Mr. Dobbs noted Mr. Perdues outsourcing record.  A day later Mr. Dobbs issued a correction noting that Mr. Trump had approved the trip.  The China Problem In 2016 Mr. Perdue had preached Republican unity as the divisive Mr. Trump began gaining ground in the G.O.P. primary. But the senator helped spark a civil war among Georgia Republicans in 2020 when he and his Georgia runoff-mate Senator Kelly Loeffler demanded the resignation of the states top elections official a Republican calling the election he oversaw an embarrassment.  More recently the senators supported a failed Texas lawsuit that would have blocked the election result in Georgia where President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. beat Mr. Trump by about 12000 votes and in three other states Mr. Trump lost.  The battle over Mr. Perdues Senate seat has been no less fierce. Mr. Ossoffs crook attack in a televised debate in October was based on disclosures that Mr. Perdue the Senates most prolific stock trader made a number of well-timed trades including in companies that could be affected by his committees votes. An investigation of some of Mr. Perdues stock dealings by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission ended without prosecution and Mr. Perdue has used those facts to argue that he has done nothing wrong.  Mr. Ossoff has revived criticism of Mr. Perdues outsourcing record. And the senator has also had to fend off charges of bigotry for both his mockery of Ms. Harriss name and an online campaign ad that showed a photo of Mr. Ossoff who is Jewish with a lengthened nose. Mr. Perdues campaign has called the image in the ad an accident caused by a filter applied by an outside vendor handling the graphic design.  For his part Mr. Perdues closing attack is in keeping with Republicans emerging argument that Democrats like Mr. Ossoff are too weak and in some cases too compromised to stand up to the threat of Chinese global dominance.  Mr. Ossoff Mr. Perdue contends is a radical left-winger with a grave China problem. He cites as proof a $1000 agreement that allowed a large media company in Hong Kong PCCW to rebroadcast a documentary Mr. Ossoffs company produced about the Islamic State.  Previous reports have characterized one of PCCWs investors China Unicom as a state-owned Chinese company a point Mr. Perdue has used in an effort to tie Mr. Ossoff to the Chinese Communist Party.  For two years he worked with the C.C.P. the senator said in a Fox News interview.  Mr. Perdue has said little about his own China ties.  In 1991 the year before he headed to Hong Kong to build Sara Lees Asian outsourcing operation from the ground up the company proudly announced a new foothold in Asia  a deal in Fuzhou China.  The joint venture Fujian Sara Lee Consumer Products manufactured toothpaste shampoo and other personal care products. It was partially owned by the Chinese government according to a report in The Chicago Tribune announcing the venture.  As the Fujian arrangement continued Mr. Perdue busied himself with building Sara Lees first centralized sourcing operation in Asia including in mainland China he said in a deposition in 2005. That involved lining up suppliers and overseeing quality control and human rights practices for the company which manufactured Hanes clothing among other things.  No American firm could have established such an operation in China at that time without dealing extensively with the government or the Communist Party industry experts said.  You dont just wander into China without central government and local party officials wanting to know what youre doing said Michael Posner a professor at New York Universitys Stern School of Business and a top human rights official during the Obama administration. Its a very controlled environment. And anybody there who is dealing with factories would have had to deal with that. (While some of its products remain on the market Sara Lee has since disbanded.)  This week The Times asked Mr. Perdues campaign if he had any other business involving the Chinese government.  The campaign declined to answer.  Kate Kelly and Jannat Batra contributed reporting. Susan Beachy Kitty Bennett and Sheelagh McNeill contributed research.  More on the Georgia Senate Races Democrats Georgia Hopes Rest on Jon Ossoff 33.
