There is still a runoff election. Early voting is May 24-29 at the Library. Election day is June 5. The races are for Place 2 and 4.  For too long Leander had people run for the wrong reasons and as a result they put their trust in staff who were hell bent on new urbanism and multi-family developments everywhere. That is why we see so many being built today. The strain on our infrastructure by these types of developments and the lack of foresight in how the systems were built led to the water issues we have today. Unfortunately improvements are expensive and take years to complete.  Donnie Mahan has served on our Planning and Zoning and understands the issues we face. I hope and pray that people who care about this city will get out and vote for him because in my opinion he must win or things get rough in a hurry. I love this city and have spent 6 years trying to turn the ship and point it toward long lasting success. Now its up to all of us.,political,Facebook
Greetings Residents  I have been tagged in a recent post concerning the water in one of our neighborhoods here in the City of Riviera Beach I must say that I too am appalled at the coloration that some residents have experienced coming out of their faucets. While I am quite certain that Utility District and City staff are working diligently to resolve this issue I ask residents to remain patient. #tough2say  Although there is no excuse for the water situation we must understand that this issue did not just begin. It is the result of years of blatant neglect and failing to address our crumbling infrastructure needs. I can assure you that I have and will continue to fight to ensure that the City of Riviera Beach does not become the next Flint Michigan. Currently we are aggressively working hard to bring a long-term solution to this long overdue issue. Our city manager and his team are working round the clock to find the most cost effective solution at building a new water treatment facility.  I ask that you write and call your local elected officials show up to the city council meetings and voice your concerns On The Record.  Again this issue did not just begin most of our infrastructure predates the 1960s where little has been done to improve it and we are working towards a permanent solution.  It's now more apparent that our water infrastructure is in desperate need of an upgrade and the investment must be made sooner rather than later. Clean safe and reliable water is a basic human right and our children and residents deserve the best. While I cannot provide excuses for the past I can assure you this is not going to be the City of Riviera Beach's future. Thank you for sharing this with me I hear you all loud and clear.  Working daily on this!,political,Facebook
What I Support  I support reasonable growth. Growth is currently putting pressure on our infrastructure and school systems. We need to have sustainable growth. Growth that pays for itself. (Including School Funding) This would also reduce the amount of school levies assessed to your property taxes.  I support social well-being for youth/teens. (Recreational Areas) Our youth are behind in Idaho. With the growth in mental and emotional health issues. We need to make sure our children have recreational outlet areas to spend time and grow skills.  I support emergency response infrastructure. With our growing community it is imperative that we have the emergency services needed to provide a safe community. Even on the southside of the tracks.  I support your right to bear arms. The II amendment is now and has always been one of the most important. I will never vote to take this right away.,political,Facebook
"Open Letter to Public Office Candidates:  These sort of letters come out very infrequently because I often feel that the time and the mental energy to put well formed thoughts to paper is outweighed by the barriers to the call to action that I am trying to influence.  What inspired this open letter is seeing all of the placards on the side of the road of this years candidates for public office in the Town of Dannemora. Before I begin I will preface with what I call my ""truth in advertising"" in that I haven't lived full time in Lyon Mountain and by virtue the town since 2013. The mountain is where my family is from and where the majority of them are buried. One day sooner rather than later I hope I will return and like those who have gone on before me I too will be laid to rest there. The thoughts of home provoke much emotion and this year for some reason at this time provoked enough to write this.  I often advocate for civic engagement in local state and national government. It is in my opinion a good thing when many people are willing to seek out a public office. I have this question and a request for those who are running and if fate permits you win the office in which you are seeking. Why do you want that office? Really why do you want it? Is imagination that is inspiring you some vision you have? These types of questions may appear cynical and I would concede that I get older I am probably getting more cynical to the dysfunction in government that I have been seeing but the question still stands; why do you want that office & what agenda do you have?  My own civic engagement started in 2004 with a campaign run for Northern Adirondack school board a campaign that I lost twice and then finally being elected in 2006. I can't say with any certainty anymore what was my primary desire for running but as I served that 5 year term my agenda shifted toward being community centered to use the school as a catalyst for community economic and academic development. The only reason I mention this isn't to blow my own horn but to establish that I am not writing this looking entirely from the outside in. I have and do engage civically when possible.  I grew up listening to countless stories of what life was like living in Lyon Mountain the 20's the 30's the 40's and even the 50's and the common theme that despite the hard work and the tragedy that mining can bring to a community; life was good people worked hard and played hard and there was a sense of unity despite families from different backgrounds and cultures coming here to work. This economic train started slowing down in the 50's when Republic Steel started selling off company owned housing and the train came to a complete stop in August of 1967 when the mines were shuttered. Our ""sister"" hamlet of Mineville fared slightly better and their operation went silent in 1971.  What did we as a community do since then since 1967? We merged our school with Ellenburg & Altona. We did keep our school as an elementary school until what 1980 and then sold it to the New York State Department of Corrections who turned it into a minimum security facility (which is moot now since it was closed and sold and still vacant). We sold the byproduct of our ancestors hard work and sacrifice to a foreign owned company for which while community taxed may have been kept low I have seen no other tangible benefit. The point of this is if we did try to do anything to bring in or restart any economic engine in the community what was it and what was the outcome? If I am way off base on this please educate me civilly and respectfully of course but my answer to those questions is we tried very little and there was very little outcome for what we tried.  The federal government whether we agree with it or not want it or not will be investing millions if not billions of dollars in infrastructure improvements. These can be renovation of existing infrastructure or new construction entirely. My proposal is this; we have two derelict reservoirs within 5 miles of each other. One on the outskirts of Lyon Mountain one on the outskirts of Standish (but that's in the Town of Saranac and not my primary focus here). We should architect and implement microhydro electric plants at each of these locations. Additionally in the space that is colloquially known as the ""tar plant"" the area that surrounds the NYSEG substation right outside of Lyon Mountain should be used for a solar array. I'm not a zealot when it comes to green energy or environmental stewardship by any means but I feel strongly that any idea is a good one when compared to no ideas. These are my best two ideas ideas that align with government initiatives ideas that align with having the base facilities (the reservoirs themselves) and ideas that align with having the space to do it (the tar plant solar array).  People will argue that either or both of these ideas are too ambitious expensive altruistic or any or all of the above. My own response to that is we only get out what we put in. Anyone who has raised a family in the last 20 years can attest to the cost of that worthwhile endeavor. Everything is expensive now. The question you should ask yourself; is what we are spending the money on provide potential long term gains or long term value to the community and I think either or both of these ideas would do both.  I close this letter to the aspiring candidates take these ideas and run with them and if you have better ideas run with those and don't let those among us who have let their imagination and idealism callous over tell you they aren't worth pursuing. I really believe in these strongly and I'd like to hope that I'd see some ground broken before the conclusion of my life. It's highly unlikely that iron mining is ever going to return to the Adirondacks. We can't wait for someone else to bring economic vitality back to our home. There is no someone else there is only us there has only ever been us. It is often forgotten that while it might have been others money it was our blood sweat tears and even death that built this town whose many stories are fabled.  God-bless and Godspeed Daniel ",political,Facebook
AMENDMENTS ON THE BALLOT -- YES TO 1 & 3. NO TO 2 & 4.  The Jefferson Parish Democratic Executive Committee met Tuesday Oct. 19 in open session to recommend yes or no to state constitutional amendments on the Nov. 13 ballot (early voting Oct. 30-Nov.6):  YES TO AMENDMENT ONE: Would streamline Louisianas fragmented collection of sales and use taxes by providing for a statewide system that promises more efficiency in general and less red tape for businesses that operate in more than one parish.  NO TO AMENDMENT TWO: Would cost the state about $25 million in revenue per year through a tax swap that would eliminate the federal income tax deduction but also cement into the constitution lower personal income tax rates that primarily benefit wealthier Louisianans. That rigidity would restrict the states ability over time to bring in enough revenue to support good schools expand early childhood education fix our roads/bridges and other infrastructure and provide services that middle- and lower-income families need.  YES TO AMENDMENT THREE: Would allow five local levee districts (affecting Cameron Calcasieu Vermillion Iberia St. Tammany and Tangipahoa parishes) to levy up to 5 mills in property taxes for addressing flood control protection without having to go to voters for approval. Other district boards in the state already have raised a millage or have this ability which allows them to move more quickly on necessary flood-control measures.  NO TO AMENDMENT FOUR: Would allow the state to double what could be cut  up to 10% instead of 5%  from protected funds when theres a mid-year shortfall. That could help safeguard unprotected funds such as Medicaid and higher ed from a sudden ax. So far so good. But whats bad about this amendment weighs heavier. There is no restriction on how much could be taken from an individual protected fund. Some could be gutted. Raiding the protected funds could very well evolve into a political crutch for solving budget issues  especially if combined with lower taxes that are constitutionally baked or politically driven. And if Louisiana has too much revenue siphoned into too many protected funds then they should be carefully weeded out.,political,Facebook
Hello Everyone! I am Eric Ritter and I am proudly announcing my candidacy for New Castle City Council on the Democratic ticket. I am a life long New Castle resident and a husband to Lacy and father of two children Noah and Aubrey. I currently am the owner and operator of EGR Home Services located in New Castle. I also serve the city as Vice- Chairman of the Government Study Commission a member of the New Castle Zoning Board President of the Lower East Side Community Crime Watch and a member of the Elm Street Project. Being in service to the city is definitely a passion of mine.  I am running for council because I want to be a part of the change that all of you want to see! In 2012 my family and I fully renovated a house that was slated to be demolished on Crawford Avenue. We took great pride in rehabbing a house that was in the neighborhood I grew up in but many other problems plight my neighborhood and many others in the city. When I walk down my street I can see dilapidated homes vacant commercial buildings and unkept properties. I see pot holes in the streets. Many nights I hear sirens and see flashing lights from my window. While our city has so much beauty there are still many problems that need addressed.  As a council member I promise to keep these problems at the forefront. I will work to combat blight and failing infrastructure recruit and retain local businesses and practice fiscal responsibility with your tax dollars. I will support our citys critical services including police fire and public works and bring my experience as a home owner business owner and local volunteer with the city to best serve you all. As a building tradesman I am used to rolling my sleeves up and getting to work. I will be no different as a councilman! Thank you all and I humbly ask you for your vote on May 18th.,political,Facebook
The California State Legislature is voting to pass a law that will allow developers to move into every single-family home neighborhood in California and turn them into high density neighborhoods. Senate Bill 9 (SB 9) will result in the elimination of all single family home neighborhoods in California. It is being erroneously touted as a duplex bill but it is absolutely not a duplex bill. Under SB 9 a single family home lot can be bought split in half and 2 units can be built on each half. When combined with existing Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) law this parcel split can result in the creation of up to 6 8 or even 10 units on a previous single-family home parcel. ADU law has separate authority which enables the construction of the additional units. At the very least this bill will result in the creation of 4 units where 1 single family home once stood.  It is URGENT that you contact your California State Assemblymembers now and ask them to vote NO on SB 9. You can find your Assemblymembers contact information at the following link:    Further the homes built as a result of SB 9 will not require any local discretionary hearing or review including compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Local ordinances can be ignored by developers under this law which will result in significant environmental and community impacts. Also there is no obligation to upgrade gas water power or sewer so the existing infrastructure will have to support 4 to 10 times as many people. Setbacks will be reduced to 4 feet so we will lose shade trees and yards to absorb rainfall. California is already a concrete jungle and we have a severe water shortage as it is so eliminating yards will be devastating to our water supply.  This bill also requires only 1 off-street parking space per unit none if the unit is within 1/2 mile of a public transit stop. This limited parking space requirement will result in parking nightmares for all residents. Just because residents live within 1/2 a mile from a bus stop does not mean that they will take a bus and the majority of residents have more than 1 car per home. Exactly how do our State Senators and Assemblymembers expect a parent to take multiple children to daycare and schools on a bus and still make it to work on time? It won't happen and these newly created parking impacted neighborhoods will make it difficult on all residents.  I have been carefully following SB 9 as it travels through the California State Legislative process and I am shocked that it has virtually sailed through each Legislative stage with virtually no opposition. Do the bill's authors and our State Senators and Assemblymembers really think that they can eliminate single family home neighborhoods in California without enraging the 21 million people who reside in these homes? The only reason that there has not been an uproar over this bill to date is because the majority of Californians have no idea that it exists.  Californians are busy earning a living and raising their families and they depend on their State Representatives to protect them from harmful laws being put before the California State Legislature. It is difficult to conceive of a more aggressive and harmful law than SB 9 and it is shocking that the California State Legislature is attempting to pass it without public input. If passed it will have a disastrous impact on millions of single family home owners in California and without any public transparency at all. Such a sweeping change that will have such an adverse impact on California homeowners should not be implemented without being put before voters first.  Another disturbing aspect of this bill is that its proponents are stating that it will result in more affordable housing. In reality it does not include any provisions for affordable housing and the homes produced as a result of its passage will be market-rate. This will have a devastating impact on low income neighborhoods and will result in gentrification. Even if it were amended to include affordable housing it would be limited in scope and would still result in the destruction of existing stable single-family home neighborhoods.  The Senate passed SB 9 with 28 Ayes 6 Nos and 6 who did not vote. It is URGENT for anyone who opposes this bill to contact their State Assemblymembers now and ask them to vote NO on SB 9. As it stands now SB 9 will pass when it goes to the Assembly floor and single family home neighborhoods will be a thing of the past. It is up to us to change the Assemblymembers' vote from Aye to No. You can even write a letter to all Assemblymembers or call them directly.,political,Facebook
"Yesterday I sent out a newsletter from my campaign to my supporters that gave a little more info as to whom I am and the values that I believe in. Most of you know my name or face but beyond that more can be found in the following text of my newsletter titled ""The Future is Yours and it Starts Now""    Sep 10 2021  I want to talk about why we need a change on our Board of Supervisors in Frederick County and why I am running. We need to ensure that our children have a bright future for their own children which is why we need leaders with vision  not just individuals with political agendas.  Many of you only know me by name or face but let me tell you a little about myself. I was born in Arizona and lived there 40 years before moving to California. Phoenix was where I met my beautiful wife to whom Ive been married 44 years. We have two children both of them raised with a strong religious foundation. We were also very involved with our childrens schools participating in the PTA. My wife was Homeroom Mom.  In 1990 my job took us to the San Diego area. Our son and daughter both received their degrees from a local college and went on get their Masters. My daughter moved to Virginia in 2004 working for the government. She married eight years ago and now has two children. My son moved to Virginia in 2006 married his husband five years ago and also works for the government.  You and I have followed different paths but we have experienced many of the same hardships and joys and we share similar dreams. We lived paycheck-to-paycheck early in my career sometimes working two jobs to ensure that our children were able to get the best that we could give them.  I am running for the Board of Supervisors because we need to start making positive and forward-thinking changes now. Frederick County is one of the fastest-growing and most desirable counties in Virginia. The countys population is expected to grow 30 percent in the next 20 years  from 90000 to 117000. We need people with the vision to prepare our county for this expansion in business education and infrastructure. We cannot have people in power who follow their own agendas or do not have the necessary experience to lead  people who tell us Thats how it has always been done. We need leaders with vision leadership capabilities and proven experience.  Since moving here seven years ago I have been involved with:   Educationworking for Head Start on several committees with the Winchester and Frederick County public school systems and on the development team for Inspire 2025 a strategic plan for FCPS.  Businessserving as CEO of the Top of Virginia Regional Chamber of Commerce working with over 800 members to assist in growing their businesses and developing relationships with senior leadership and small business owners and serving on the Virginia State Board of Directors for Chamber of Commerce Executives.  Communityworking extensively with a number of non-profits. While on the Blue Ridge Hospice Board I was appointed interim CEO where I served for a year and a half navigating the impact of the COVID pandemic. I also serve on the steering committee of the Non-Profit Alliance of the Shenandoah Valley was recently elected to the Board of Directors of the Community Foundation of the Northern Shenandoah Valley and have participated on several Shenandoah University committees.  I could have chosen to run for the Frederick County Board of Supervisors as an Independent but the Democratic party ideas most closely align with my own values. As such Im running as a moderate Democrat striving to reach Independents and moderate Republicans. I believe in the 2nd Amendment for all Americans which protects the right to gun ownership but I also believe that there should be common-sense laws regulating high-powered military-style weapons. I believe in equality and opportunity for all people and in protecting the rights for people of all races religions and genders in our community. I believe in the availability of healthcare for all and private insurance as an option. I believe in investing in our schools and community for high quality education for our children with supporting infrastructure such as housing broadband and transportation. I believe in promoting business growth to elevate incomes for our families financed in such a way that it provides a fair and equitable return on our investment. If you agree with me that it is time for a sensible change on the Frederick County Board of Supervisorstime for leaders with the vision to take us into the futureI hope you will support my campaign with a donation or your volunteer support. And I thank you for your encouragement.  PS: As we prepare to mark the 20th anniversary of the terrible attacks of 9/11 I know you join me in acknowledging and thanking our own first responders and others who bravely put their lives on the line every day.

ISRAEL  THE INSANITY CONTINUES  Rabbi Yakov Saacks The Chai Center Dix Hills NY  I dont know about you but whenever I hear the term conflict in Israel I am incensed as there is no conflict per se but rather a barrage of rockets from usually the southern border coming from Gaza courtesy of Hamas or from the Northern border gifted from Hezbollah with Iranian money and support. These rockets are not aimed at military sites or other strategic places that would help their military cause. Rather they are aimed indiscriminately into civilian residential neighborhoods killing and maiming men women and children.  NO COUNTRY There is no country in the world that would tolerate such attacks on its citizens. None. There would be fierce retaliation to not only stop the rockets but also to punish these vile aggressors. The fact that Israel warns the inhabitants of buildings to flee before retaliating in order to minimize casualties is a tremendous act of kindness. Once again no other country would warn their enemies before attacking them giving them advance notice.  While Israel recognizes life as sacred which is not the case with people that advocate homicide bombings I believe that Israel does not need to practice restraint against terrorists groups like Hamas or Hezbollah.  In fact it is Israels sacred duty to defend her citizens at all costs as it is the duty of every other nation. Israel should not be the exception.  PROPORTIONALITY - A FAILED ARGUMENT There is a failed argument called proportionality. It is an insane rotten vile nonsensical approach to attempt to hinder Israel from protecting its citizens.  The proportionality argument goes as follows. Since Israel is a stronger force with a larger army it needs to reduce its power to the same capacity or in proportion to its enemies. This is immoral and wrong. In fact if Israel would act in proportion to Hamas it would kill men women and children via cowardly attacks at bus stops and malls.  Furthermore proportionality is not an accepted premise under international law. Lets be clear Israel is not a wrongdoer for having a superior military and Hamas is not a poor victim for having a limited military.  U.N. First if you were silent when Israel was barraged by thousands yes thousands of rockets upon its citizens then you need to be silent now. One cannot spout one-way rhetoric. This goes for the U.N. who only gets involved in a panic when Israel responds. The U.N. is immoral and serves no purpose other than to condemn Israel for human rights violations. Some of the U.N. countries who lead the U.N. Human Rights Council are China Venezuela Russian Federation and Cuba. I am surprised that North Korea is not in on the action as well. You really cannot make this stuff up.  MONEY It takes a lot of money to fire thousands of rockets. Where is this money coming from? Who is supporting terrorist causes who kill children?  Can you imagine if this same money went into infrastructure like schools hospitals and universities? Is there enough money to vaccinate the populace of Gaza against Covid or is all the money going to jihad?  Last I looked Iran has given 1.77 million doses of which 292000 have had both doses and are fully vaccinated. Now Iran has a population of close to 83 million. Should this not be a priority? It is not. The priority is to take money from nave and other Chamberlainesque countries and convert it into weaponry that causes death and destruction in its wake.  It is no Mitzvah to give them money. It is quite the opposite. It is a dastardly act and needs to stop.  GAZA STRIP We must remember that most Gazans are civilians and are being held hostage by a wicked unscrupulous crooked group who have blood lust on their minds. While it is true that Hamas was voted in by the Gazan populace this is because the Palestinian Authority had less money to offer than Hamas. This is a hard lesson learned. One has to be careful what they wish for/vote for because now Hamas rules with an iron fist. Besides the last election took place in 2005. Who knows what the outcome of a more recent election would look like?  For every Israeli and Gazan that is killed I place the blame on Hamas Palestinian murder trivializers politicians who give terrorists money bias media reporting. BDS fools and any and every outside agitator.  You have blood on your hands.  I pray for peace.  Feel free to share. Not sure it will help but on the off chance.,political,Facebook
Rodolfo Arevalo Candidate for Spring Hill City Council Questions for candidates:  1. What is more important for our city right now: building new homes or adding commercial space?  I believe that one of the critical needs for the city is to increase economic development by bringing more businesses to our area. This would include small restaurants service providers and mid to larger industrial companies. This would increase our tax base and decreases our reliance on residential property tax. Commercial space would be needed and designation of another industrial area.  2. If you are elected what three steps would you take to put our city on a firmer financial footing?  If I was elected I would:  Initiate the creation of a long term strategic plan for the city. The plan would identify long range goals and priorities for the city.  Conduct a forensic audit of the city budget and assess how current expenditures focus on the concerns of our residents and needs of the city.  Define funding priorities and insist on adherence to funding limits in all city departments.  3. Which is more important: the new neighborhoods (subdivisions) or the old main part of town?  I dont believe that one is more important than the other. Service should be provided in an equal bases and on the needs identified by priorities identified by the citizen of Spring Hill. The older parts of the city may have more needs in the area of infrastructure because of the age and how systems were develop years ago.  4. Do you feel you are more conservative or more liberal?  I am more conservative but am willing to take a critical look at how we provide service to our citizen. I am definitely fiscally conservative and have always tried to do right in a fiscally sound way.  5. What do you hope to accomplish in your term as a city council member?  I would like to ensure that city services and programs are responsive to community needs; That as a council we become more open and responsive to our residents and that we communicate clearing the reasons for why services programs and funding are initiated and why goals can or cannot be achieved. Having said that I hope to reduce property tax level increase senior staff productivity reduce waste and focus on long range infrastructure maintenance of streets drainage and sidewalks.  6. What are your thoughts about the new justice center?  I believe that the current city council and mayor have not had thoughtful discussion of the issue. As a result there was an uninformed decision to contract for plans to develope an architectural plan for a new building. It is interesting to note that since the idea was flouted and a firm hires to put a design together that nothing has been reported for over six months. I do not believe a center is needed and that there are more reasonable alternative to resolve some the issues expressed by the police chief. I would not support the building of a justice center at this time. I estimate that such a building would require the property tax mill levy would have to be raised between 7 to 9 mills. This would not be fiscally possible for most residents of Spring Hill.  7. How have you already been volunteering or serving in the city?  I currently volunteer at the Spring Hill Food Pantry and have done so for the past four years. I am concerned about the wellbeing of our residents and assist were I can. I also serve as an election worker/volunteer assisting the county during local and national elections. I am also a member of the Spring Hill Rotary Club who is engage in many volunteer and philanthropic activities in the city and school district. We are fundraising for completion of Veterans Park.  8. If you received a $1 million grant to use for the city any way you wanted what would you prefer to do with and why would you use it for that purpose?  I would use the funds to make infrastructure improvement in the older section of the city. This would include improvement of drainage initiation of a street and sidewalk enhancement. If possible I would seek to improve the old downtown business district and use funding to increase business development by enhancing building and streetscape to create a more inviting atmosphere. These improvements would encourage more visitors to our history downtown.  9. If you are not elected what would you do to try to help work on ideas or issues that are important to you as a citizen?  I would continue to serve on the Planning Commission in order to influence long-range planning effort by this group and encourage the City Council to act on them. I would continue to participate and attend the Johnson County Commissioner meeting and our City Council to provide input on issues that would benefit the city.  10. What do you feel makes you stand out from other candidates who are running?  I have over 42 years of experience working with public service organizations. With over thirty years in administrative and leadership positions. I have an educational background and experience in accounting and financial management with responsibility for an annual operating budget of approximately $240 million dollars in my last position. I currently serve on the Spring Hill Planning Commission have attended city council meeting for the past four years and regularly attend meeting of the Planning Commission Cemetery Board and the Parks Advisory Board. I have volunteered to serve on local and county government boards and commissions in a number of cities in Kansas Texas California and Washington. I have been involved in volunteer organizations such as; The United Way Rotary Clubs Optimist Club Leadership Hays YMCA Mental Health organizations Community Child Development Center Santa Clara County Commissioner on the Commission for Developmentally Disabled; Hays Chamber of Commerce; West Plains Chamber of Commerce Cheney Washington; Greater Spokane Incorporated (Chamber of Commerce/economic development); Spokane County STEM Learning Network; International Trade Alliance Advisory Board and Chairperson Governors Public Health Improvement and Planning Commission for the State of Kansas. I have experience in organizational strategic planning and supervision of large complex organization with staffs of over two thousand employees.  I have experience in budget allocation/financial management and implementing of organizational planning . I have worked and developed relationship with state legislator business persons and worked with private and public foundation. I have been engaged in grant writing and have obtained over $9.4 million dollars in grant funding from federal and state sources. I have also participated in the Johnson County Leadership Academy to learn more about how the city can partner with the County to achieve our goals. I have been a resident of Spring Hill since 2014 and would like to assist the city with its future development.  I am an independent citizen willing to work hard for the betterment of our city. I continue to learn more about the needs and concerns of our residents every day and dont have all the answers for resolving all of the citys issue but am ready to work to build coalitions with those that have the same interests.,political,Facebook
I want to talk a little bit about election security and Voter Id. More dangerous ground as what I am about to say is likely to annoy both sides. First of all I do not think President Trump lost the last election due to voter fraud. I think his behavior (not his policies) just alienated too many independent voters he needed to repeat his win from 2016. I have researched and researched for any sign of proof of enough fraud to affect this election and have not found any. Add to that Sydney Powells claim that no one would reasonably believe her claim of voting machine fraud that it was only political speech and I just do not see any proof. I am not from Missouri but am very much a show me kind of guy. I want to see the proof and make my own decisions over people telling me what to believe.  Secondly the potential for fraud and abuse in our elections are very much real and we need to be proactive to address it and yes one of these actions means voter IDs. If anything this last election has shown how vulnerable our election system is to doubt being created. These are things that our adversaries will use in the future through misinformation campaigns and psychological operations to create doubt in our constitutional republic system of democracy and to further divide Americans. If we are too busy fighting ourselves we cannot take care of ourselves and our country.  For whatever reason close to half of the country has lost faith in the security of our election system I think restoring that faith is well worth the cost and should be treated like any other threat to our nation.  With all of this being said I do not see either the Republicans or the Democrats being serious about fixing this issue they are both using it to their advantage at the expense of our country. I base this on a simple observation.  From the Republican side if they were really concerned about voter IDs they would take the democratic claim of disenfranchisement and address it. Any security measure we take will cost money. If the Government will require an ID to secure an election then the Government should pay for it and provide it once. If a ID is stolen it could be replaced with a police report to show it was actually stolen. Grants can be established to help pay to get the required documentation (or we could just make it simple with a $100 credit per dependent on next years taxes). Lets say the total cost would average $100 per person. With somewhere over 330 million people you would be looking at $33 billion dollars. Sorry world securing our elections is more important then your aid packages (2019 we sent over $39 billion in foreign aid). For most of us that already have a government issued ID the cost would be much lower than $100.  From the Democrat side they have long had the practice of throwing money at any little problem if they were truly worried about disenfranchisement they would have come up with my recommendation above a long time ago and told the Republicans to put their money where their mouth is. With the mammoth infrastructure bill President Biden is pushing you really think they would not have found $33 billion to put in there if this were a real concern of theirs?  Election security is just another issue the establishments are using to fire up their bases at the potential risk to our country. Voter IDs are just one piece of the picture when it comes to election security but it seems to be the one everyone is talking about.  I will leave you with one last set of figures. $33 billion for Voter Ids or $10 billion to Jeff Bezos so he can get awarded a contract he actually lost? You decide American Voter Security or Corporate welfare.,political,Facebook
Our MOST PRESSING current issue is our infrastructure: city roads and utilities in need of repair. Our leaders have underfunded this in the past and it is catching up with us.  There is nothing partisan about this issue. My promise to you is to make this my TOP PRIORITY. We have reached the crisis point.

LAUSD Teachers!! You are not being provided with all the resources allocated to you by the community so that you can be as successful as possible. Teachers and students alike are being held back by the district due to their wasting or stealing of our resources. LAUSD is almost done with the last bond that got passed for $5 BILLION and now they just got a new one for around $7 BILLION. Thats $12 BILLION or around $12 million per school!! Every school should be looking brand new with state of the art classrooms. New windows (not sure if that's ever been done at LAUSD) new roofs new bathrooms solar panels the works but instead we have crumbling infrastructure. Look inside your classrooms be honest it doesnt reflect all the money the community has dedicated to the district or to you. Each classroom should have a TA with all the money LAUSD gets. We can do so much better than LAUSD. Please join us so we can help you help our kids.,political,Facebook
I need to ask you all for the greatest favor.  I am asking that if you do not see my name on your ballot for Tuesday Please write me in.  I do not believe the election results of 2020 are certifiable.  I do not think the election would be fair to be redone with the existing candidates.  I ask that I be considered a write in.  I will take the role for no salary as Mr. Trump did. I know how difficult this must be to read for so many reasons.  I can only do the new salary portion of us because Im relying on my businesses getting going.  Should this all work out somehow I promise that I will do my absolute best at giving 110% to the daily roles and responsibilities I will need to take over  My entire life was geared toward one goal and without a college education there doesnt seem like another pathway for me to D.C  Most of my apparent mania was because of this goal.  My long term objectives are pretty well laid out.  Affordable Housing Medicare for All Welfare Reform Initiate a war on Homelessness  Education Reform Social Security Overhaul  Transportation Railway and Infrastructure corrections and modifications  Implementation of high end internet security devices and software across the country to remove the risk of data privacy issues for both civilians and government.  I know all the questions you may have and why you may say how do you think you could be qualified  The only answer I have is I feel as if I were always going to end up right here.  I believe that we have a tremendous amount of work to do.  The world didnt quite catch up to us in Avi-tech? But the proximity blew me off my chair this last July.  I spent my 4th of July watching the supply chain issue begin. It has been heart wrenching to know that the world relies so heavily on tech however the big 4 corporations chose not to do more.  I see this as negligent at a level that is unreasonable.  Biometrics for logging onto the computer and the Internet have been around a long time and Im not quite sure this push didnt happen years ago.  #1dayatatime,political,Facebook
I just voted NO on the Democrats Infrastructure legislation.  Our nation is in desperate need of infrastructure reform and investment but this bill is not the way to do it. Democrats have made it abundantly clear that this legislation is simply a trojan horse for President Bidens radical Build Back Better agenda and paves the way for a laundry list of socialist policies.  Out of the total $1.2 trillion of spending in this package only $110 billion is directed towards roads bridges and other real infrastructure projects that our communities need.  Most importantly the pay-fors in this bill come up short. Over $400 billion of the $1.2 trillion price tag is unpaid for adding to our skyrocketing national debt and once again forcing hardworking Kansans to pick up the tab.,political,Facebook
I am going to combine two topics in this post regarding things going on in Congress this week that should be done in two separate posts but my budget for boosting posts is currently limited due to personal expenses. First I want to call BS on both parties for their responses on the bipartisan infrastructure bill they are working on in particular how it is going to be paid for. The Republicans say they are opposed to raising taxes especially corporate taxes but want to pay for it with increased fees. One of these fees they want to increase is the excise tax on gasoline. The excise what? This means paying for infrastructure would fall on working Americans who have to drive back and forth to work. The Progressives in the Democrat party and the President are opposed to increasing the gasoline tax. The Green New Dealers are opposed to something that would actually boost EVs and fuel efficient vehicles and reduce fossil fuel consumption. Since I am concerned about global warming I support any measures that reduce the production of CO2. Full disclosure though I drive a service vehicle home so I do not pay for commuting and my wife just drives a little in a fuel efficient vehicle. I predict both parties will agree on how to pay for infrastructure using their favorite source borrowing it from our grandchildren. The second topic is voting rights legislative proposals especially Senator Joe Manchins compromise suggestions. Senator Manchin has proposed national voting rights that would preempt state laws including some of the new restrictive laws made by red states. There were several points in Manchins proposal but I will concentrate on a few of them. He proposes a national requirement for voter ID but allows for less restrictive ID requirements that a lot of states impose. He proposes a ban on partisan drawing of political districts ending extreme gerrymandering that gives political parties too much power in giving members an advantage in elections. This is a foundational plank of the Independence Party. Another proposal one that will really draw fire from Republicans is he wants all states to offer mail in voting to all voters. Hard core right wingers oppose this saying that mail in voting is too fraught with potential fraud. Yet there has always been mail in voting commonly called absentee voting  available to certain groups who cannot physically make it to their local voting place. Probably the largest group of absentee voters are military service members who are stationed away from home and depend on this type of voting. If mail in voting is vulnerable to fraud for any it is vulnerable to fraud for a few. Should we make service members have to have witnesses see them seal their ballots and have their signatures scrutinized and rejected if it is not close enough to one that is on file that they may have signed years earlier?

"MODERN MONETARY THEORY: MISREPRESENTED ONCE AGAIN  Recently on a Bloomberg financial podcast an executive level employee at J.P. Morgan stated he did not believe in Modern Monetary Theory (MMT). MMT is a controversial monetary theory which offers a description of monetary operations which challenge orthodox economic and financial thinking. Within current MMT reasoning there is a belief there is room for fiscal expansion which when coordinated with the Nation's central bank--the Federal Reserve (FED) will enable public investment in human and physical capital i.e. infrastructure without inflationary consequences. The J.P. Morgan executive argued that in order for MMT to succeed that it would also have to fail: that to accumulate the debt which he implies is acceptable to MMT for public investment then even if the investment proved good for the economy the accumulated debt would then tank the economy.  It was the strangest comment that one could expect from an investment banker and it also misrepresented MMT views. First from an investment banker perspective it is strange to state that debt issuance condemns an institution to failure. Bankers afterall are peddlers of private sector debt issued on the belief that the gains from private investment will generally exceed the cost of capital. Government debt issued in order to facilitate productive investment: physical and human likewise has the potential to create long term gains in the economy which exceed the cost of capital. So it was strange to hear an investment banker ignore the growth potential associated with public debt issuance which finances physical and human capital investment: the type of investment promoted within the MMT framework.  The MMT public sector investment portfolio would include such things as green energy investment in education and most importantly a federal job guarantee program which would offer a job to anyone who seeks a job at a livable wage with health and child care benefits--a near full employment program.  A legitimate concern here should not be the level of debt so long as the associated funds are directed into productive investment but the concern should be the potential inflationary impact of large scale investment which creates individual earnings not yet matched by an increase in the provision of consumer goods and services. The temporary mismatch between increased earnings from new investment and the availability of goods and services may create short to medium term inflationary pressures in these consumer markets. One market concern undoubtedly is the belief that once inflation begins it feeds on itself into an upward spiral of increased inflationary pressure which can only be resolved through monetary and fiscal tightenings i.e. an induced recession.  It is not clear to me whether MMT has adequately addressed the short term inflationary impact of broad public infrastructure investment. MMT definitely recognizes that Federal spending is limited by potential inflationary effects of Federal spending and it seems they differ from the broader market participants in their view of the size and scope of available resources which can be put to work before real resource restraints create inflationary pressure. In other words it seems that MMT believes there currently exists greater slack in the economy than the broader market participants believe and it also seems that MMT believes that increased productive capacity which meets consumer demand can come online rather quickly in order to thwart these inflationary pressures. The latter view is undoubtedly challenged in a trade restricted environment.  It appears that MMT takes the long view and the bigger point is that green energy will eventually be a more efficient source of energy while high tech education combined with liberal arts training will make us both more productive and better citizens. The federal jobs programs will assist in the development of work skills which will further enhance national productivity. Debt used to finance such activity would be a very good use of debt and will not inflict damage on the national economy but rather will enhance long term growth in a noninflationary manner.  Much of the above discussion is premised on a misrepresentation of the MMT view on public debt. The J.P. Morgan Executive's view is premised on the idea that Federal deficit spending must be funded with debt. This is not the MMT view. Federal debt issuance is a policy option not a requirement for deficit spending.  The MMT view is that a sovereign monetary authority such as the U.S. which creates its own free floating currency creates money when it spends and destroys money through taxation and borrowing. Money creation and money destruction need not be equal. Spending need not be fully funded but only 'funded' to an extent and in a manner which prevents inflation in the goods services and asset markets. In other words deficit spending need not be funded with debt: the money for deficit spending is created through the act of spending. An equivalent debt issuance merely destroys an equal amount of money thereby neutralizing any inflationary impact of the deficit spending. Debt issuance money destruction is a mere tool for inflation control and for other convenient purposes i.e. private portfolio investment stability store of value interest rate targeting . . . .  Furthermore the Executive's narrative ignored debt management techniques discussed elsewhere on this Page (""Federal Debt Revisited"" scroll 5 essays down) such as debt extinguishment the Platinum coin idea which grew out of the 2011 budget ceiling crisis taxation of the well-off rather than borrowing from the well-off and Federal Reserve perpetual holdings of Treasury debt on its balance sheet--which is costless to the U.S. taxpayer. The brief discussion of MMT was yet another false representation of MMT views.  Generally it is wise to dismiss about 85% of corporate reporting on MMT views. Most commentators have not seriously examined MMT; others are in no mood to change the status quo. Large capital interests in the private sector simply do not want to concede additional space to the public sector regardless of the long term growth potential associated with public sector investment.  Undoubtedly the Nation's long term productivity potential would be greatly enhanced by the above public sector investments. But in the long run the current investment class won't be here. Perhaps this is part of the problem. The other part lies in the short term investment horizon of private sector firms responding to investor demands for short term profits which overall does not align with the long term investment objectives of the Federal government.

If you are interested in keeping your taxes low please consider this.  Right now our tax rate is the lowest it has been in city history. This is due in large part because of good financial management a booming economic development unlike anything any city has seen (60 businesses 3 of those being fortune 100 companies one being a fortune 10 and thousands of jobs being created) and the fact that I have been able to personally bring in $500 million of other-peoples-money to pay for infrastructure so that homeowners dont have to. Thats how you keep taxes low and still build infrastructure (roads water power and sewer). The land purchased by Facebook and Google increased in tax revenue 2 million%.

"Here are the Top 13 Bipartisan reasons Newsom should be Recalled... but there are so many more ....  1.Nursing Home Covid Deaths Gavin ordered ill equipped long term nursing home care facilities to accept covid positive elderly patients which spread and devastated the nursing home care population in our state. 2. His Support of Prop 47 Not only did he support Prop 47 but while mayor he appointed the co-author of prop 47 George Gascon to DA in San Francisco. This is the bill that decriminalized breaking and entering theft property crimes public urination and defecation in the street. 3. Wild fire and Destruction His policies on forestry management or ""lack there of"" has let to massive wildfire destruction over and over again. The fact that California stopped practices like clearing brush thinning the trees and controlled burnings in so much of our forests only made matters worse. 4. Government made drought Californians and businesses are perennially plagued with water shortages caused by man not the weather. Gavin Newsome refuse to build more water storage like reservoirs or dams and trillions of gallons of water each year are directed toward the ocean. He has also openly supported the decommission of four hydro-electric dams near the Kern river. This will shorten the supply of both water and electricity in California and costs will continue to go up. 5.The Self-Imposed Energy Crisis California of course has abundant energy. Yet California cannot reliably provide energy to the tens of millions of Californians and their businesses. Power shutdowns are a regular part of life and its biggest energy provider PG&E has warned shutdowns will be a fact of life for a decade. Newsome is nowhere to be found on spearheading an effort to have industry leaders from around the country get together to solve this problem that has costs so many jobs. Instead in his tiresome fashion Newsome blames others. 6 .The Unemployment Fraud Scandal The largest fraud scandal in the history of any state is exploding in California. Apparently controls were so lax that COVID-related benefits (over $100 billion in total) were paid to prisoners people out of state and fraudsters. 7.Job Losses and Highest Tax in the Nation. Tesla Hewlett-Packard Oracle are only a few of the major businesses leaving the state due to expensive unnecessary regulation and over taxation taking thousands of jobs with them which is also devastating to our economy. 8. California Budget Crisis California leads all states in debt and infrastructure problems. California is unsustainable because of its pension and other public debt. Newsom has done nothing to stave off the impending fiscal nightmare other than making it worse through higher spending. Lets not forget the purchase of 420 million masks to the tune of $316 million from a Chinese contractor. 9. Sanctuary state status and failing to enforce immigration. Gavin endorsed laws that favor illegal immigrants over that of our own citizens. Many illegal immigrants working under the table also take advantage of social welfare programs here in California where there are loop holes a plenty. 10. Hypocrisy and Sheer Arrogance While Gavin Newsom imposed rules against restaurant dining he was caught not wearing a mask not properly social distanced eating indoors at an expensive restaurant in California called the French Laundry. Also While his mandate that bars restaurants and Breweries remained closed He kept his own winery called Plump Jack open. While he supported public school closures which were harmful to so many children in California He made the choice to place his kids at an in person private school. Last but not least there is Newsom's $312 million Dollar mask deal to buy masks from a well-connected Chinese company while there were struggling impacted business here in our own state that could have been contracted to produce face masks. And To top that off I heard the masks from China failed to pass the federal safety certifications. What a waste. 11. Closure of churches during COVID which is a direct violation of the First Amendment. The Supreme Court ruled against Newsomes ruling. 12. The Homeless Crisis- blatant disregard of the problem. Instead of working toward a viable solution he spends millions on trailers and tents. 13. Releasing 76000 inmates - including violent and repeat offenders because of crowded conditions and/or COVID.",political,Facebook
"Em Hotep Nefer   Come the year 2050 according to the metrics of continental geopolitical ethnography Western Europe will become a Muslim enclave and Africa will become a Chinese continent. In 1974 Chairman Mao Zedong put forward the theory of the three worldsChinaEuropeAfrica..Europeans became complete atheists from the 1950s after WWII..They decided to cut down Religious mind control and ended up closing down most churches and turned the buildings into libraries and community museums only leaving a few historical ones that have more to do with their royal system..They thought they are more liberal that way and would rank higher on countries where people are free to do whatever they like and also boost the economies. Little did they know that the vacuum created has to be filled up with something else..There is now a lot of Moslems living in Europe and they are in an aggressive missionary mood too..*While European leaders are taking steps to reverse this trend; African politicians instead of setting up a ""sinking fund"" against Chinese onslaught are just happy to revel in their own batty of their leaders eating junk handouts.* _Fact 1:_ Compared to Africa communist China is a little country indeed Africa is about four times the size of China. Yet the population of China is 1.5 billion same as the population of Africa.. _Fact 2:_ In terms of mineral resources Africa is the world's richest continent and it is a hundred times richer than China.. _Fact 3:_ China wants Africa's land and resources by hook or crook to ensure the survival of the Chinese race.. The Chinese communist party's policy for Africa is a POPULATION SWAP solution that will ensure the survival of the Chinese race..It is laid out in an obnoxious instrument from 1963 and follow-up meetings with Nyerere Mugabe Chissano Dos Santos Museveni Vella Pillay of SACP and other African leaders..US assisted many European countries during world wars and demanded disbursements in the form of money land islands infrastructures government control etc..On the other hand China helped most African countries to gain independence from Western imperialists..They also built a number of projects like dams bridges power generation points hospitals universities agricultural and projects like the Tanzania-Zambia Railway standing as monuments to Sino-African friendship..*But do Chinese look like they can just help you for free? Think again.*  Recently you needed a certificate allowing you to bear one child in China..With the law-enforced one-child policy in place there is a problem: as the child come of age becoming parents themselves one adult child is left with having to provide support for his two parents and four grandparents..Called the ""4-2-1 Problem""..Mandatory abortion contraception and sterialisation laws imposed also come with some moral questions: *who would really want to _kill_ their own children corner women into limited control over their own bodies and render the men _powerless_?* Why not exercise these necessary evils on the dark continent?..  China intends to send half a billion people into Africa before the end of year 2040 and these families will be encouraged to bear four to five children so that by year 2050 (as population will double) there will be over 2 billion Chinese in Africa. During that same period African population is _strangely projected to decrease drastically by some unknown occurrences_..End game the Chinese population in Africa will surpass the African population by 2050..*China will effectively own the African continent and its resources..Afrikans and their descendants across the globe are still lucking Unity and the Spirit of UBUBTU that was deliberately destroyed by Asiatic Arabs Europeans amongst them the Ashkenazi..  As at end of year 2020 over 50 million *Chinese citizens* have already being pushed onto the African continent some of them hardened criminals taken out of jails as they believe in the barbarity needed..Dejavu this events a repeated cycle in Afrikan Native lands..There are about 2.5 million in South Africa about 2 million in Nigeria over a million each in Ghana and Ivory Coast about a million in Zambia as well as Zimbabwe and hundreds of thousands in Kenya Tanzania South Sudan Rwanda Ethiopia Congo Liberia among other regions..There are pockets of them everywhere in 54 African countries in Africa..This events are forcing South Africa to cancel Chinese free visas..  In readiness for the takeover the Chinese are snapping up African roads rail seaports and airports..Their _modus operandi_ is to grant African countries some *toxic loans* to build their much needed infrastructure and get African leaders to sign a shrouded contract written in Mandarin that will permanently transfer the ownership of these ports to the Chinese nation..  Kudos to the eagle-eyed President John Magufuli of Tanzania who *tore up a contract* signed by his predecessor and told the Chinese to go home  of course he met with untimely death..Rwandan president was recently cautioned by a visit from Chinese President Xi Jinping after trying to expel 18 Chinese businessmen for mistreating locals..He ended up just announcing a veiled general statement that Africa must not export its raw materials but went on to sign 15 bilateral agreements with China some of them written in mandarin..  In Djibouti the Chinese deceptively taking over that small *country's seaport* and setting it up as their military base..There is a military build-up going on there now as the US have also setup a base there to keep the communists in check..Zambia is under surveillance as the new president is trying to check the level of chinese fungus.  China is pushing hard to get their citizens into the *police force* of all African countries..Zambia allegedly recently commissioned a few Chinese nationals into their police force but had to take the uniforms off them after public outrage..There are Mandarin speaking Chinese police officers roaming the streets in South Africa they even have their own police stations and can arrest detain and interrogate offenders in SA including South Africans..  In all African countries this is standard Chinese policy in fact most Chinese companies in Africa have *fully armed Chinese security guards* who from time to time turn their weapons on Africans..There was a recent incidence in SA where a Chinese employer locked up his workers under the guard of Chinese security and forced them to work for one week against their will..  In Kenya for several years now Mandarin has been taught to low income kids for free around the cities slums like Kibra in Nairobi..Chinese building East Africans infrastructure do bring in their own machines and their own employees hiring less than 1% of the Natives..Chinese Bosses in Kenya have on numerous times videotaped beating African employees with whips and sticks for coming late to work..The Chinese had their own restaurants in Kenya with signs that read No African/Black people Allowed where one was recently shutdown by the authorities..  In Mozambique the Chinese built a whole city of about 400000 houses and these were initially lauded as impressive developments *Mozambicans are not allowed in there* only the Chinese..There are similar Chinese cities like this in other African countries..  In Nigeria the Chinese are hiding in *mineral rich rural areas* and are heavily involved in illegal mining dozens of them were recently arrested in Osun and Zamfara..There are many more hiding in the rural communities where they are protected by powerful tin gods..They have also infiltrated the Zimbabwean rural areas like moles burrowing out every sweet potato in the ground. Mining concessions are politically given to Chinese companies easily..In most African states Mandarin the Chinese language has being introduced into the secondary school curriculum..  China has over the years put itself forward as a geriatric Savior who wants to help Africa grow and has all along given sympathy and support in their struggles against colonialism and for national independence and liberation..But after we saw the way Africans were molested in China during the Covid19 debacle we now understand their true intensions..They want our resources but they don't want us..Africans were dragged out of their hotels denied access to hospitals eateries and were not even allowed into supermarkets..Some were chased down the streets and beaten blue black by the communist police..Almost as if it was a dry-run for the near future..There was an art gallery where we saw the Chinese comparing us to monkeys and that gallery has not yet being pulled down..  For all Africans it is time to take action to cut down on the Chinese influx into Africa to stop the illegal mining of our mineral resources to stop the ongoing dehumanisation of Africans on our own soils..We need to pay attention if we don't want to pay the price yet again..China is not a friend of Africa and we do not need China..China has only one diabolical intention they want to take what is ours they want to lay claim to our inheritance in the same unfortunate way the Asiatic-Hebrews European-Christians and Arab-Muslims did before..  Africa was brutalised by robbers from the North for the longest since around 1000BCE by the West since 1500AD a long time and now looters from the East want to outdo the exploitation and finish it off..As long as Africa remains divided by ethnicities social class European boundaries mountains rivers and legislatures that continue to serve well to the greedy politicians as they are the middlemen who transact business from our resources to our former colonizers like France Britain Germany Belgium n their likes we will forever remain the _poor but richest _ continent..

Hello my name is Aaron Voss and I am a current City Council member who will be running for re-election on November 2nd. My wife Molly and I have called Walford our home for the last 7 years and we truly appreciate the relationships we have built with the community during that time. Our two young daughters both attend College Community Schools where my wife also works as a paraeducator. I have worked in the information technology field for the last 20 years and currently serve as the Director of Infrastructure and Security for a national insurance agency. I attended both Kirkwood and the University of Northern Iowa studying information systems and business. During our free time we enjoy camping outdoor activities and spending time with friends and family.  Over the last 4 years I have considered it an honor to serve the citizens of Walford on our City Council. Through multiple projects accomplishments resignations and difficult decisions I have continued to do what I think is best for the Walford community. Through research collaboration and careful thought I have made the decisions that I feel have the most positive impact on all community members and will make Walford a better place today and in the future.  With my term coming to an end on January 31st 2021 and seeing what yet there is to accomplish I have decided to run again for city council. Rather than a full 4 year-term I have elected to run for the open vacancy 2-year term which must be filled by law after the resignation of a previous council member. This is the reason why my name is listed separately from the rest at the bottom of the ballot with the TFV notation or To Fill a Vacancy.  Looking back on my original focuses we have made good progress but there is still work to do.  Communication - When I started on the council Walford didnt have much of a digital presence beyond an outdated website. During my last 4 years we have created a Facebook page to easily share community information and revamped our website for easier access. We also tested streaming our city council meetings which I hope to establish as a regular practice in the future. Doing so will allow every to watch live or as a recording to see what is going on with their local government.  Long-term Development - All around us other communities are developing plans and working towards a vision for the future. As a small town it is important that we establish our vision and dont let others set that path for us. During my time on the council we worked to develop a long-term strategic plan which collected feedback from the community on their ideas for the future. While that document has yet to be finalized we have extracted some of the most important pieces and it will provide a resource for future councils on what is possible.  Infrastructure Sustainability - Ensuring we invest in the things we need to keep our city operating is an important role of any city council. Over the last 4 years we have refinished roads added new recreational activities at the park and spent considerable time planning and executing on the DNR required upgrades at the Waste Water Treatment facility. Moving forward I want to ensure we are making smart investments to reduce future costs and improve in areas where our residents will see the most value. Just like an individual household we must spend a small amount of money now to avoid larger expenses in the future.  Community & Safety - Walford is a place we are all proud to call home and it should not only provide everyone with the opportunity to be a part of the community it should also be a place we all feel safe. While our crime rate is low as it should be traffic on 151 is a public safety concern. If re-elected I will continue to push for improvements with the department of transportation to slow down traffic and make intersections safer for cars and pedestrians.  Thank you to every for their support over the last 4 years and thank you for your consideration as a candidate for Walford City Council.,political,Facebook
My wife and I chose to move to Hernando ten years ago because it was a safe and stable community with great schools. We saw it as a perfect place to start and raise a family.  For Hernando to maintain this safe small town feel we have to grow strategically and we have to invest in infrastructure and public safety. I believe in running government like a business not spending more than is taken in and funding priorities first.

I humbly ask for your vote this Saturday March 20th  I want to fix the major disconnect between our government leaders and our residents by upgrading technology currently being used such as better communication through social media parish app individual council members apps for direct communication. I want to put live web cams at drainage canals and pumps for instant notification of problems and responses. I believe flooding is currently being fixed with great current multi million dollar projects already approved and in process however as we keep adding subdivisions we simple need better checks and balances on major infrastructure issues such as but limited to flooding to avoid the past mistakes. I believe recent flooding could have been avoided if their was not this major disconnect between our administration council and residents especially the new residents.  Second we must upgrade all of our recreation facilities for our children and new children moving here as we continue to add homes and families. I firmly believe kids need more athletics or other outside activities and less video games. Our recreation facilities clearly do not match up with other parishes and I want to fix that.  Third I want to take a fresh new look at major traffic problems that we have had for years that our administrations and councils appear to just pass blame down on to others like railroad companies and DOT.  I hope I answered your questions about my agenda if you have any specific questions or concerns I would love to hear them please post or IM. I Further sincerely ask for your vote this Saturday March 20th.  Paid for by Joseph Ciro Larre campaign fund,political,Facebook
The next decade will say a lot about how we live our lives in Greater Minnesota. Over the past two decades we have been losing people to the cities and out of state. The purpose of this post is not to be all doom and gloom or to cause fear. It is about how we need to plan for the future and we need to look forward over looking back.  The heart of western Minnesota I believe is rooted in our agricultural history. Agriculture can also be what carries us to the future.  One of the things I have been working on lately is looking into the possibilities of hemp. As I mentioned last week the more the government pushes electric cars the more it will impact ethanol demand and therefor corn demand. We need to have a plan for when that happens. It will not be tonight or tomorrow but it will happen.  There is a couple of downsides for hemp today but it is also what will drive opportunities. The first is that it is not a crop that has been grown in large fields in the US therefore large equipment has not yet been developed for the mass growing and harvesting to maximize the plant yield.  Secondly we do not have the infrastructure to process hemp for all of its usages in the US. There are some areas working on it but it is still in its infancy. The areas who develop that infrastructure first will be the areas most able to capitalize on it.  Hemp has many usages from what you already see such as CBD oil to replacing plastic in many applications replacing lumber by pressing it into boards (takes much less time to grow hemp then a tree!) hempcrete (a biomas product used for construction and insulation) and animal feed just to name a few.  So what is holding us back? What normally does government interference. You remember how I mentioned animal feed earlier? Hemp meal can top proteins of 20% only issue is you can not legally use it for feed commercially. THC level restrictions are another if a crop has THC levels above .3 the crop will be destroyed.  I spoke with Colin Peterson about this and he was telling me they had tried to make this level 1% over .3 but other groups pushed back on it.  If we overcome this government interference private companies will be willing to make these investments in the infrastructure and this can bring jobs and industry back to our areas and breath life back into small town Minnesota.  Again this does not happen overnight it is probably a decade away but I can see a co-op someday in western Mn doing the same with hemp as we already do with sugar.  If we want to keep our way of life we need to fight for it and build to the future.  Give me your feed back and opinions I aim to represent you I need your input.  Bull,political,Facebook
Hello Facebook Friends! Instead of discussing the fourth plank of my re-election platform Im going to use this post to address Mr. Morabitos answers to the Tribune Review questions in the Sunday April 25 edition of the paper.  If you have an opportunity to re-read the article you will notice I didnt even mention his name. However since he did mention mine I think it is important to share the facts about the issues he discussed.  Mr. Morabito claims I want to keep the township rural to the detriment of commercial development. The only way township supervisors can keep a township rural is by refusing to upgrade infrastructure like sewers water roads broadband etc. Allegheny Township has strived to keep all of these things up-to-date and in top notch condition in order to make the township inviting to both residential and commercial developments. We have ten residential housing plans a Towne Center Zone designed especially for commercial businesses as well as beautiful rural farm and park areas. They co-exist in perfect harmony and the tax base is vibrant and strong. I have no plans to change any of that!  Mr. Morabito claims he will apply for a lot more grants than are being applied for now. Thats a pretty big statement for someone who has attended ONE township meeting in 20 years! The township brings in thousands of grant dollars every year for police parks roads and special projects. Grant money pays for the School Resource Officer who serves the Kiski Area School District state-of-art police equipment including traffic cameras and a computer in each car and the Tredway Trail as examples. The township supervisors have applied for and administered over $1.9 million in grants in the past 9 years.  And about the national commercial Realtor. One does not have to be an elected official to contact developers to help his community. Where has Mr. Morabito been all these years while looking across the street from his business in Lower Burrell at the empty Wards and Penneys properties?   I urge you to reject this false prophet and vote to allow me to continue to serve the citizens of Allegheny Township as supervisor.   As an addendum to Post #3 Staying Out of Debt by paying down our $1.8 million dollar debt seven years early we saved the township $333815.85 in interest!,political,Facebook

This is just the beginning of great things to come!  It has been my honor and privilege to serve Gautier these past 11 years and it has definitely been a roller coaster ride. When first elected this city that I absolutely love and adore was in a tailspin; economic development was in decline finances were in dire straits and it seemed the city had lost its focus. I ran for council with the promise of always being a voice for the residents to follow my heart and dedicate everything possible to help this great city reach its full potential. It hasnt been easy and things havent always worked out the way I envisioned but we are making great strides. Along the way there has been many sleepless nights sometimes almost unbearable stress and personal tragedies but my focus and dedication to Gautier has always been steadfast.  We now have the best city manager and staff ever and their dedication and attitude has recently propelled this city to new heights. Paula Yancey who I personally asked to interview for interim city manager which council ultimately appointed her to the position permanently has been a breath of fresh air for this city. Her connections from a career in the public sector along with her leadership skills has put the City of Gautier in a very good position and department morale is at an all-time high. Gautier is now financially stable capital improvement projects are now a norm instead of nonexistent city events are plentiful and economic development is beginning to bloom. The Ward 5 projects I envisioned and worked tirelessly for have finally become a reality. These include but are not limited to the Martin Bluff Road Sidewalk project (contract awarded and construction to begin shortly) dredging of numerous navigable channels within the Hickory Hill area that tie into Bayou Castelle waterway (projected to start this summer) and a new bridge to raise the lowest part of Martin Bluff Road well above Flood stage. This bridge is currently under construction and means first responders will not be restricted access to North Hickory Hill during major storm events anymore. City wide infrastructure improvements are also underway with much more to come.  Throughout my time as councilman for Ward 5 I have always done my best to be responsive to the residents whether it be day or night weekdays or weekends and holidays; my phone is always on. The majority of the time I can help and Ive always been honest and forthright no matter the circumstances. It is not uncommon to be told the information I provide is very thorough and includes a great level of understanding. Many have stated that I bring balance to City Council am not afraid to ask the difficult questions and will fight for what is right through informative debate. That is my role as your elected official.  After much soul searching discussions with family and friends and requests from many people in the community I have made the decision to move to the next level in City Government and am hereby announcing my Candidacy for Council At-Large. My intent is to serve the entire city with the same dedication as Ive served Ward 5. I humbly ask for your vote in the primary election this April 6th.  Lets keep Gautier moving forward because Im only getting started!  Adam Colledge Candidate for Council At-Large City of Gautier,political,Facebook
This afternoon I just voted NO on advancing over $4.5 trillion of government spending proposed by the Democrats.  The $3.5 trillion spending bill drafted by Bernie Sanders proposes $68 trillion in total spending over the next decadethe highest sustained federal spending level in American history. At a time when our national debt is approaching $29 trillion and rampant inflation is causing the price of consumer goods to soar Democrats continue to put their left-wing priorities ahead of hard-working Kansans. This legislation would impose a multi-trillion dollar tax hike on middle-class families including Kansas family farms small businesses and energy producers. As the crisis in Afghanistan rages on with no solutions from the administration in sight Democrats want to spend billions on electric vehicles and single-payer healthcare while slashing funding for our troops to the lowest levels in 80 years and providing no increased funding to secure our southern border.  The infrastructure bill is no better. This piece of legislation has a price tag of $1.2 trillion and only spends 6% on roads bridges and highways. Instead of reducing burdensome regulations this bill would make it more difficult for much-needed infrastructure projects in Kansas to move through the federal bureaucracy and red tape. Most importantly this bill is not paid for despite what Democrats want you to believe. According to the Congressional Budget Office roughly $400 billion of the bill is still not paid for. Our county is in desperate need of true infrastructure reform but this bill is not the answer.  The bottom line is that our country faces multiple crises from all angles but throwing more money at the problem will not lead to solutions. It's reckless irresponsible and a raw deal for Kansas taxpayers.,political,Facebook
SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE PACKAGE: OH MY  Looks like the MMTers (Modern Monetary Theory people) are losing this round. The social infrastructure package which started off as a $6 trillion Bernie Sanders ambition then shrunk to a $3.5 trillion package is now lingering around $1.75 trillion or so. Various financial analysts think this a big deal but it is not. $1.75 trillion spread over 10 years is a measly $175 billion annually less than one quarter of the U.S. annual military budget. Apparently the powers-that-be believe that a powerful fighting force will gain a greater return on investment than a well-educated civilized people.  Maybe the Democrats could revert to the Sander's $6 trillion package spread it over 100 years and make everyone happy. The progressives could claim victory because they will have gotten a $6 trillion package. The Party's conservative wing could claim victory because they limited the additional spending to $60 billion annually. Even the Republicans would be thrilled because they could point to the $6 trillion number and call the Democrats spendthrifts.  This has got to blow the MMTers away. The Modern Monetary Theory people understand the vast charade which is going on. All the concern about federal debt is nonsense investment in people and physical infrastructure is what will advance the Nation. Debt financed federal deficits is a policy choice it is an accounting convention of which we choose to abide.  As a sovereign nation with its own free floating currency the sovereign the U.S. in our case can create all the money it needs without taxation or borrowing taxation and borrowing are necessary however to prevent inflation in the goods services and asset markets (actually borrowing is never necessary but has other practical applications). With this in mind the U.S. can invest the necessary funds for a strong future nation restrained only by the inflationary impact of such investment. There will be a lag between the investment and the eventual supply of goods and services adequate to meet the additional money created through the investment. This is where the inflation comes in.  If you are worried about the current U.S. debt a large chuck of it $5.5 trillion or so sits on the Federal Reserve's (FEDs) balance sheet and it can be purchased by a platinum coin created by the Treasury Department's U.S. Mint or held in perpetuity by the FED where it is cost free to the U.S. taxpayer or simply extinguished through an Act of Congress in combination with the creation of a new FED intangible asset account to prevent the hit to the FED's balance sheet--a hit which would otherwise eventually pass to the U.S. taxpayer.  Higher government investment will need to crowd out private investment not for lack of investable funds which are virtually infinite but in order to prevent inflation due to excessive investment demand. This of course is why the social infrastructure package is resisted it would be an enlargement of government at the expense of the private sector but I would argue for the benefit of the people and the Nation at large.  The Nation does not need more private sector investment which churns out $15 an hour jobs alongside a growing class of billionaires and millionaires: Elon Musk--$306.5 billion Jeff Bezos--$192.9 billion Warren Buffett--$104.7 billion . . . . The Nation needs investment in human capital which will create good paying jobs and to better distribute corporate gains among the poor and lower middle income groups whose dire straits are the result of an over reliance on the private sector.,political,Facebook

"Here are some of the objectives that would be most important to me as a member of Nixa City Council followed by an introduction so that you can get to know me better!:  - Bringing new businesses and jobs to Nixa to boost our economy and infrastructure and balance taxation while supporting local small businesses and helping them to thrive - Supporting our youth and our school district in every way possible - Supporting our elderly residents in every way possible - Supporting the growth and continued excellence of the Nixa Police Department - Implementing new diversity and inclusion initiatives and striving to support and meet the needs of Nixa's under- represented residents - Improving sidewalk connectivity throughout town particularly near schools - Improving traffic flow and speeding issues in problem areas such as school zones - Streamlining city processes to make them as efficient and accessible as possible to include establishing a virtual platform for city council meetings and making improvements to city utilities processes - Continuing the revitalization of the downtown area - Improving and beautifying public spaces - Supporting the visual and performing arts in Nixa - Increasing recreational opportunities for kids and adults of all ages and abilities - Encouraging greater voter interest and turnout - Encouraging volunteerism in the community - Educating residents about and encouraging them to use our free curbside recycling program - Advocating for a second dog park in north Nixa and at least one splash pad  Hello! My name is Amy Hoogstraet (HOOK-strat) and Im thrilled to announce that I'm running for city council in Nixas first district. This is my official campaign page. You might know me on Facebook as Amy Jane Hoogstraet Safley but for campaign purposes Im using my legal last name. Id like to introduce myself and tell you why I want to serve you on Nixas city council. This is a very long post but I wanted to give you as much information about me as I could in order to help you in deciding if I'm the candidate for you. I hope that you'll take the time to read the whole post!  I grew up in Springfield where I graduated from Drury University. After marrying a soldier I spent 20 years away from the area but it was always ""home"" and I finally returned in 2017. My husband and I chose to make our home in Nixa because we loved the small town feel and were very impressed with the schools and we are so happy with our decision! We feel that Nixa is our home and we have no plans to go anywhere else. We have a 16-year old son and a 6-year-old daughter and a fabulous miniature poodle named Sam.  After holding various interesting jobs I left the workforce to become a stay-home mom which is a move I have never regretted. As my youngest has gotten a bit older and more independent and since moving to Nixa I have finally realized my dream of becoming more involved in volunteering advocacy and helping others however I can. This sounds clich but honestly helping others and finding solutions to problems are my passions. And when I commit to something I'm ALL IN!  I am on the board of directors of GLSEN-Springfield which supports and advocates for LGBTQ youth and I also volunteer with PROMO an organization which fights discriminatory legislation in Jefferson City. A defining moment for me and one in which I learned how much I love being involved in government was when I went with PROMO to the Capitol in Jefferson City to speak with legislators there. I was completely in my element and I was good at it  I was hooked! Additionally I founded and am administrator of the Facebook group Nixa MO Diversity Advocates which seeks to celebrate support welcome and educate about diversity. I believe that in diversity (in ALL of its forms!) lies great strength richness and depth and I am very passionate about being a voice for those who are under-represented and fighting for equal rights for all.  Another experience which crystallized my love of civic/government involvement was when I had the honor of serving on Nixas Strategic Planning Advisory Committee this past summer and fall. The committee was comprised of volunteers from the community and was tasked with culling through public feedback and listening to subject matter experts in order to come up with Nixas next five-year strategic plan. It was a lot of hard work and I loved every minute of it! Working with a varied group of people who had a lot of different opinions and priorities but who all agreed that they wanted what was best for our community was exciting and challenging and I not only made valuable contributions to the process but also grew from it. This experience left me feeling sure that I wanted to continue my involvement with local government and with helping to bring the five-year strategic plan to fruition. Its a wonderful ambitious plan and Im very proud to have contributed to it. Im excited to see what we can accomplish in the next 5 years and the amazing ways in which Nixa can grow and improve! My work on the committee along with attending city council meetings has shown me how much grey area there can be in issues involving a city and its residents and I really enjoy the challenge of working within that grey area to find solutions. With my history of volunteerism advocacy collaboration and leadership along with my involvement in the strategic plan joining our city council feels like the next logical step for me and Im incredibly excited at the thought of serving my community in this way!  Why should you vote for me? I believe that my experience on the committee and my prior involvement in the strategic plan puts me in a perfect position to pivot right into city council. I have made valuable connections and have a great rapport with several of our council members and city administrators and feel comfortable working with them. Im continually impressed with our citys administration and would be honored to serve alongside them! As someone who contributed to the five-year plan I am very committed to helping see it through in a way that offers the most benefit to our community. I believe that my education and experiences have equipped me to work confidently yet humbly with others and to look for commonalities and ways to compromise to come up with good solutions to tricky problems. I am a very logical analytical thinker who naturally looks at problems from all angles and perspectives and can think outside the box when needed. I am level-headed and feel comfortable interacting with people even when they disagree with me. Im not given to knee-jerk reactions but rather to thorough consideration of all viewpoints. Im not running with any single agenda  I simply honestly love Nixa and want to help it be the best town it can be. I believe that with a great governing body Nixa can continue to grow be progressive and innovative and stay a leader in the region while still remaining true to its small-town roots. I also believe that the more diverse city council is the stronger it will be and Id love to help further diversify our council by becoming the second woman on the current council. I want to continue to be a voice for those who may not have one and for ALL members of this town I love. I want to see Nixa be as strong as it can be to help build bridges and to unify us while doing my best to make thoughtful decisions with the greater good of the community ever-present in my mind. I truly believe that despite our differences we all have much more in common than we may realize and we all want whats best for our community.  The bottom line is this: I love Nixa I want to help improve my community and build on what is already amazing about it and I believe that my skill-set makes me uniquely qualified to be a valuable member of city council. If elected I pledge to do my absolute best to serve you and I will always be accessible to my constituents. I am an excellent communicator and will be sure to keep the lines of communication open share what is happening and seek feedback from my constituents.  So please consider voting for me! I would greatly appreciate it if you would like and follow my page and share share share! If you dont live in district 1 share my page with friends who do and help me get elected so that I can bring continued progress vision and collaboration to Nixa! Thank you for your time.  Stay tuned  in future posts I will talk about some of the plans and goals for Nixa that are most important to me! And Im always eager and happy to answer any questions you may have.  Please remember that if you support my campaign the single biggest thing you can do to help me is to SHARE MY PAGE (or even a particular post from my page) ONCE A WEEK until the election to like my page and to invite your local friends to like it. The only way that I can win is to reach enough voters in District 1 and convince them to vote for me and for that I need your help! I won't be asking for monetary donations for this campaign - only for a minute of your time each week to help spread the word. :) Thank you!",political,Facebook
Hey everyone! The election is now just 3 short weeks away! In these last weeks it is crucial for me to reach as many district 1 voters as possible. Please help out by sharing my campaign page and telling your neighbors and friends in district 1! I am so appreciative of your support and help and if elected I will work as hard as I possibly can on your behalf.  The Christian County Headliner reached out to all of the city council candidates with 5 questions for us to answer. These answers will be published in the newspaper but I'm not sure when. In the meantime I thought I would go ahead and share my answers here:  1. List any relevant qualifications or experiences you would like voters to know about:   I am an active and well-known volunteer leader and advocate in the area (with PROMO GLSEN Free Mom Hugs Nixa MO Diversity Advocates etc.) and already have working relationships with members of the city council and administration the police department the school administration and board and other city leaders. In addition I was a member of the Strategic Planning Advisory Committee which crafted Nixas next 5-year strategic plan. As such Im invested in the plan and eager to be a part of its implementation. With my previous and ongoing civic involvement in addition to my body of experience and skills serving my community on city council is the next logical step and one Im very passionate about taking!   2. What action if any should the Nixa City Council take in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic or in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19?   It seems like Nixa has been doing a good job already of slowing the spread and I believe that with the availability of the vaccine theres light on the horizon. Were not out of the woods quite yet though and we must take care to avoid a resurgence. I believe that wearing masks and physical distancing in addition to getting vaccinated are still the best steps we can take over the next few months. Once the current mask mandate is ended I think that the best thing council can do is to continue to encourage (and serve as an example to) Nixans to wear masks and physically distance and to get vaccinated when eligible. I believe that businesses should remain open and some events should start to take place again with proper precautions in place. And the more of us who are vaccinated the sooner we will all be able to get back to normal.   3. What is your opinion about the level of accessibility that the Nixa City Council has with the general public?   I believe that council has done a great job of being accessible and transparent. Meetings are always posted on the citys website as well as social media and agendas are available to the public ahead of time so that residents can plan ahead as far as attending or speaking at meetings. District 1 council member Jarad Giddens has been very proactive about keeping his followers informed on social media and our citys Director of Communications Drew Douglas goes above and beyond to disseminate information. All that said there is always room for improvement and the citys 5-year plan includes a website overhaul as well as the creation of an interactive app for residents. There are also plans to create a virtual streaming platform for city council meetings for those residents who cant attend in person. Im excited about these changes and think that they will move the city to a whole new level of accessibility!   4. Is there an area of city government that you hope to develop advanced knowledge of in the future? If yes describe.   I cant necessarily point to one single area as Im fascinated with all of them! I want to learn as much as possible and plan to do so while continuing my civic involvement whether or not Im elected to council. Most issues are not black and white but rather have a lot of grey area and I really enjoy the challenge of working within that grey area to find solutions. In attending city council meetings and listening to ordinances being debated and residents speaking about issues I have consistently noted that there are usually valid points on both sides of an issue. Much of the time decisions made by the council will make one group of people happy and one group unhappy - thats a very tough spot to be in! But its this process of weighing pros and cons and figuring out which solution would best serve the greater good which intrigues me and which I think Im very well-suited for. Im a logical thinker who is very detail-oriented analyzes problems from all angles and thinks outside of the box when necessary. In addition I feel that I have a strong ability to empathize with others  to put myself in their shoes. Many issues brought before city council would not affect me personally but that doesnt mean that I wouldnt care about them or take them seriously. I believe strongly that part of being a contributing member of society is recognizing that something shouldnt have to affect you personally for it to matter to you  we should all care about each other. My great passions in life are problem-solving and helping others and as a member of council I would be able to put those passions to work and be a voice for ALL Nixans.   5. What level of involvement should Nixa have in partnering with other local governments such as Ozark and Christian County and with regional economic development groups? Why?   I believe that Nixa should have the highest possible level of involvement in partnering with other local governments and regional economic development groups and from what I have seen so far I think that it strives to do so. Nixa does not exist in a bubble and cannot possibly thrive unless it works in concert with other local governments and agencies. Nixa Ozark and Christian County as a whole share the same issue of being bedroom communities  our residents may live here but a great majority of them work in another municipality. This presents unique challenges to our economies and there is much to be gained by working together to address these challenges share ideas and collaborate in creating solutions. It can be tricky for a bedroom community to find a good balance between supporting local small businesses (We have some really wonderful small businesses here!) and welcoming new businesses which will bring more money and jobs thereby boosting the economy and infrastructure and better balancing the tax burden. Im eager to be a part of finding and maintaining that balance.,political,Facebook

Millimeter 5G is too high of a jump of gigahertz without any testing. Is it worth our health for faster data high density info transfers? Humans cant develop in the same way in an atmosphere permeated with electromagnetic frequencies. Scientific studies on EMF (Electomagnetic radiation frequency) have proven to dampen down our intelligence. All these studies show how it kills trees and bees. Mmwaves Is the same frequency used in crowd dispersal weaponry. Its basically interrogation equipment to spy on us. you dont know youre being targeted. It causes neurological damage and makes you sick. Its a perfect hidden weapon for the government. Children are getting nosebleeds that theyve never had before. Its everywhere all the time. We rolled it out before the standards of health on us could be determined. EMF blackout: is the Small wireless communications facilities deployment act: its standardizes permits fees right of way use and other regulations of wireless providers. See Senate Bills 637 and 894 With the Help from lobbyists and corrupt officials federal laws were put in place making it illegal in some cases to speak of the health effects surrounding cell phone towers and electromagnetic radiation. according to an act passed in 1996 act 704. That law 704 took away our tenth amendment rights of the states to regulate the location of cell towers based on our health which overrides the 10th amendment. Which assigns all powers not delegated to the US or prohibited to the states or to the people from making a decision. how did they prevent lawsuits? In section 704 in 1996 Bill Clinton signed the telecommunications act into law which states that no health or environmental concern can interfere with the placement of telecom equipment. Our tenth amendment rights were taken away by the wireless industry. How was that law allowed to be passed if it violates our rights? It gave the power to regulate the health effects of wireless technology to the FCC. The FCC is a spectrum auctioning agency. It is not a health agency. 704 also took the power from the states to regulate location of cell towers based on health. If you mention it to your town that you dont want it the application will be rejected because the city can be sued by the wireless industry. All of this research can be found in pubMed. This is where my sources have come. Plus from watching the Michigan house committee hearings in 2018. Scientific studies have shown that Wireless radiation has biological effects oxidative damage DNA damage memory problems dizziness brain fog exhaustion heart attacks CHF muscle spasms longer reaction times breast cancer from putting cell phones in there bras back problems behavioral changes eye damage sleep problems depression infertility when cell phones have been placed in a mans pocked or a womans pocket blood brain barrier permeability Brain tumors Alzheimers Parkinsons and ALS. EMF cause headaches dizziness irritability fatigue weakness insomnia chest pain difficulty breathing and indigestion. Altered calcium metabolism and heart muscle cells Changes in our Hippocampus affecting memory and learning. DNA damage in cells Behavior altered avoidance. One smart meter is 7.93 micro watts per cm. Squared. The healthy range is set much lower. How can utility companies and government get away with forcing this on everyone?  This is how the FCC standards to manage health effects are wrong. How much radiation are people being exposed to? What is our exposure in one day? Cell phone smart meters cell towers are all stacked up like a sandwich that all adds up.  Microwave power density: health effects versus safety standards The USA safety limits are set to 600-1000 micro watts per cm squared which is 10 of thousands of levels higher than the health standards set by scientists and way higher than other countries standards which standards are at 10 and below. FCC had to move these standards way up to avoid future lawsuits of 5g These are signs of neglect and disregard on behalf of the FCC How much money has been put aside on independent research on the biological effects of this new technology? Zero Funding was done from Motorola on previous generations and when their research came out bad they said what spin can we put on this? Motorola told scientists what to do and how to write abstracts. Well A non industry study was done and it showed EMF radiation was 70% harmful. An industry study showed that radiation was 32% harmful Well Motorola wasnt willing to accept the scientific findings. They urged the scientists not to publish the study. Probably paid them not to. Smart meters literally are human energy field obliterators. A study showed when stood in front of a smart meter what happened to the persons cells. It showed It broke and created mutations of our cells oxidation exposure to free radicals headaches red blood cells stacking up and not being able to deliver oxygen and it degrades the cells. Wifi is 2.4 GHz which is the same as microwave oven wattage. 60 gigahertz is used for the active denial dispersal weaponry - it is also used as psychological weaponry. Oxygen molecule absorption is at 60 GHz.  The FCC has strategically hijacked the legal system and silenced all potential threats into 5G infrastructure roll out which is the biggest fraud on the public ever conducted  Tom Wheeler was the previous chairman of the FCC. he was the head of it for 14 years. Obama took the biggest lobbyist who is Tom Wheeler and put him as the head of the FCC. 1993 the FCC together with the IEEE (Which is the engineer association) passed regulations 30 years ago. They set the current standards for acceptable limits of EMF radiation technology. Why do engineers get to decide radiation?they show how radiation can pass through a wall but they cant talk about when it passes through a body? It makes no sense to adopt an engineer association with not one biomedical person on their team. They are indemnified against harmful health affects lawsuits. Our acceptable limits are higher than the limits shown to cause harmful health effects. These Standards were developed for six minutes of exposure. What about the long-term daily exposures?  Its like a fox guarding the hen house. If you go to put a denial permit request in to not have a cell tower put in near you its going to point back at the acceptable limits as determined by the FCC. And its going to be denied. Not the EPA not the CDC not the ones that usually take care of health concerns. The FCC is staffed by former members of the telecommunications industry. Insurance wont indemnify against the EMF effects. The investors only worry is that they will lose money. The insurance companies will not ensure the telecommunications companies. They are self insured because they were rejected by the insurance companies. The secondary insurance company insures the insurance companies. If an insurance company ensures Verizon and it meets the claims than the secondary insurance company is kicked in. They were told not to ensure the wireless companies.  In 1999 the FDA and NTP conducted a 16 year $30 million study examining the effects of EMF radiation. In 2016 a partial report was released. And they found a link between cell phones and cancer. Until 2016 thats how they prevented the discussion of health. FCC is not able to oversee 5G for safety. More bills passed between 2016 and 2018 remove the last vestiges of local and state review over infrastructure siting. Our immune system is based on the microbes in our gut and in our brain. Microbiome is essential to human function. EMFs produce toxins to our microbes. Microbial DNA will be deleted. Which is 99% of our DNA structure.  NASA created chem trails which is Microdust weaponry. It is bio micronsized mechanized dust distributed as aerosol which gets into the lungs executing pathological missions which creates a phosphorus glow capability in our bodies so we can be flagged. the real purpose the government wants to get on board with this technology is so that they can track everything we do. 5G can now read you as a transmission technology Like infrared. 5G may interfere with the ability of DNA to retain and transmit biological signals.  Wi-Fi should be banned in schools. Education not radiation. Wired networks only. Children are sick and being misdiagnosed. Kids getting cancer due to unknown reasons. When Pregnant women use EMF radiation cell phones during pregnancy it damages the fetus in utero. which can lead to autism when a child. When a man puts its cell near his private parts in his pocket its really damaging the sperm quality and quantity when left there for long periods of time. The frequency in the high levels of EMF radiation are pulsating constantly 24/7 and we are the guinea pigs. Studies suggest that in 150 years all humans will be sterile five generations from now If keep going at this rate.  Why such a big race to compete with China? Its all about control. Who can get there first. we dont need all of this radiation. All of the benefits of this cool technology of driving cars by them selves. It is not worth our health and all living creatures health. We wont be able to afford all this cool technology when we are all sick and cant work. 5G is designed to deliver concentrated and focused EMR in excess of 100 times of the current Heathy levels. Thats why the USA moved up the levels in any other country to such a dangerously high level so it cant be disputed. 60 gH is used as directed energy weapons. So if that level is running all the time. 24/7 if someone happens to be living next to it and cant run away from it they are being forced to being exposed to it. And all that the people can do is accept it and try to prevent ill health by painting there walls with emf blocking paint to protect them selves if they are aware. But w WiFi in there homes they cannot protect themselves. They cant think straight. Its too inconvenient for people to set up wired technology. But they must. 5G is designed to deliver concentrated and focused EMR in excess of 100x of current levels in the same way as directed energy weapons. 5G is an invasive bombardment of antennas. 250 antennas per block. And also 20000 satellites for 5G to be launched sending focused beams of intense microwave radiation over earth? Its all about winning the race to 5G. Its a fast plan to beat China. FCC is violating the Nuremberg code.  5G is for intelligence government systems that has to be commercialized to make it look appealing to the citizens. They are marketing how its great. Its main use is a weapon system. Wi-Fi transmits to smart meters it transmit to the utility companies for billing purposes but its really for usage data. RF signals are repeated many times per second. it increases the effects of exposure exponentially. It will kill bees livestock the ground we will all be under attack. Theres no value in killing our humanity for all the greed and corruption at the cell phone companies and the government will make off of this through taxpayers money. DNA is has been unchanged since the beginning of time but if this technology causes our dna to be changed and damages our DNA from this exposure we are damaging our future generations. If we can even survive it. The weak have not been able to survive it yet. Canada opted out of 5G. They paid to not be harmed basically the government has to pay the cell phone companies to not harm them. But our government doesnt want to pay it they want to be paid. They see all the revenue this will make but the unknowing consumer has no idea what theyve gone into. Its being pushed down our throat by a company that is not responsive and by a government that is not responsible. Its done in collusion that is designed to undermine the individual rights of individuals and communities throughout and around the world. A right to life is threatened. There are no public debates no public discourse no public disclosures as to when it will come how it will come and where. Its been passed by the president. Smart technology really stands for S:secret M: militarized A:Automated R: Residential T: technology That is the new meaning of smart and it is actually the stupidest idea if they dont listen to scientists. Only way that we can survive in this technology is training our microbes to be tolerant of 5G. That is this vaccine that they are trying to create. this is the 5G apocalypse of human extinction. Its invisible stealth trackable technology 24 seven. Its infiltrated the main frame without any health science behind it.,political,Facebook
FOR Nebraska Inc. promotes healthy safe use of Nebraskas rivers.  The increasing number of airboats on Nebraskas rivers is an issue for all Nebraskans. Citizens have reported hearing airboat noise miles from Nebraskas rivers during all hours of the day including late at night and early morning. Weddings church attendance funerals family reunions picnics community center gatherings classroom learning non-motorized sports outings and daily conversations have been interrupted by deafening vibrations and noise of airboats.  Airboats offer speed and access to rivers where other watercraft cannot go but this speed is accompanied by noise pollution and disruption to the environment and surrounding communities. Unlike highways railroads and airports infrastructure airboat noise is recreational with rare exceptions for search rescue and environmental studies. Persons on airboats wear earplugs and headgear to protect their hearing. People and animals near Nebraskas rivers do not have ready access to this protection.  Responsible citizens need to report airboat noise pollution to authorities as a nuisance or annoyance which is not an emergency. Use the following links to report airboat noise:     Calls about airboat noise are logged. Elected officials use evidence to consider further Nebraska legislation regarding regulation of airboats and noise.  F.O.R. Nebraska Inc. promotes healthy safe use of Nebraskas rivers. F.O.R. Nebraska Inc.s recommendations include lowering airboat noise below 75 decibels restricting hours and dates of airboat use limiting numbers of airboat licenses and a curfew.

The new infrastructure bill just passed has many hugely positive features. I would like to focus on one - removal of lead piping from older housing stock. Lead is toxic and particularly so for children. Lead deposits into bone structure and is difficult to chelate of the victim. Lead diminishes intellectual capacity. Just for a moment consider the truly awful societal consequences of this lead in pipes.  The new bill that most republicans resisted will provide funding to remove those lead pipes.,political,Facebook
"We have so many issues in District 2. I would like to point out one that will affect us for years. That is ""growth.""  We strive to grow but that's not the issue. The issue is ""quality""of growth not ""quantity.""  The more growth we have the more taxes we collect. These collected taxes can help provide additional services.But if these taxes are not used in District 2 the area will continue to decline as we are already behind in law enforcement and infrastructure needs.  When I'm elected in June I will seek out quality growth in District 2.  We do not need massive growth without the necessary supporting structure that will cause even more crime transportation issues and dilapidation of buildings.

After tonights ballot drawing I will be #6 on the ballot on the May 4th election. I appreciate your support so far and look forward to your support through May 4th and then as your city councilor. Here are my stances:  Police 100% support in funding training and equipment  Water Maintain local control and invest heavily in infrastructure improvement  Streets Paving streets that are in desperate need of repair instead of cherry picking streets based on nepotism.  City employees Civil service protection for city employees to protect them from petty small town politics and politicians  Fire Advocating increasing funding to the fire department for the purchase of a ladder truck needed for structures 3 stories or more in town to reduce homeowners insurance premiums  How are we going to pay for this? We already have the funding to pay for these things I believe diverting money away from pet projects (fountains signs flowers city hall renovation) and into these areas will drastically improve the living standard in our town.  I cant do any of these things without you so please when you vote on May 4th remember me Dean Bishop!,political,Facebook
I want to help the City of Westland to prosper grow and become a safer city to live in and Raise a family. First: Our services here in Westland need to continue to grow. Not just during election time. Roads are in dire need of fixing and replacing. Broken and unsafe sidewalks are being ignored. The city already has been sued for one accident on a broken sidewalk settling out of court.  I hear other candidates say the same thing over and over about how things need to change and be fixed. But not one of them say how to fix any of these issues.  I have worked for the City of Farmington Hills for over 25 years. I can bring new and fresh solutions to our budget roads and sidewalk problems. There are many Federal Grants that the city can apply for to fund road repairs and replacements. Involves a lot of paperwork dedication and a little work. Traffic counters. You never see them in Westland. This is an important tool used to get data on road use. Then turned in to SEMCOG (Southeastern Michigan Council of Government MDOT and Federal Highway Association). This is where you get funding help on major roads. Other types of grants can come from CMAQ ( Congestion Mitigation and Air). These are good for bad intersections and signal projects. The major fund that all cities get is the Act 51. Michigan distributes gas and weight tax to road agencies based on a formula outlined in the State Act 51. It a hybrid formula. Based on lane miles (major and local roads) and populations. This money Westland gets in the millions can be used for roads road staff sidewalks and drains. There also the TIP program (Transportation Improvement Plan) A federal aid program. So many ways of funding roads and sidewalks. Its time now for Westland to get caught up with new ways of funding road and sidewalk projects.  Second: Winter road funds. Now money can be saved on Winter road funds. The amount of salt being used is a waste. I helped the City of Farmington Hills develop the largest brine making facility in Michigan. Our roads in Farmington Hills are the best in the State for winter safe driving. Winning the Winter Award from the APWA. We cut our salt usage by over 50 percent. That not a typo. As a matter of fact. Westland has even come to Farmington Hills for salt when they ran out of salt. The prices for salt increase every year. By calibrating these salt trucks to know exactly how much they are putting on the roads  and by using liquids Westland can save 50 percent or more on winter roads funds. Thus giving you more money to use on better things. When other municipals are running out of salt they come to us because we found new and better and ways of dealing with snow and ice on roads. It is not rocket science but it is a little bit of science. The liquid De-Icer is a tool for certain situations. There are several different liquids. I have traveled to many states attending seminars. Learning new and better ways to clear roads a greener way and ways to save money during winter operations. I can help the City of Westland save money on road repairs replacements and winter operations. Making Westland with the best roads around.  Third: We need to bring back. Leaf pickup. By doing this we would have less floods on our roads. The littlest rain now floods our roads. This is unacceptable . By doing this it will help keep the drains cleared and water flowing off the roads. Keeping our roads safe and our underground infrastructure secure.  Fourth: Our Police and Fire need help. They do Great job but are stressed to the max being short staffed and in need of better equipment. Again there are federal grants out there the city can be using to help with the budget and get more staffing and better equipment. Training is important. We need to keep our police and fire up to date in training. All our streetlights need to be working. Streets that do not have any streetlights need to be put in immediately. Street light funding can come from some of the grants I mentioned earlier. No reason why streets have no lights. For the Police and Fire there are Federal grants out there to help offset the city cost for training and additional staff. There also portion of money given back to the police when they have property and cash seizures. This can be used for equipment and more. We need to take a Closer Look at The Budget Again. Safety and security for the people need to come first. We need more Police and Fire Personal. Our Police and Fire staff work long and tired shifts. This is not safe for them or the residents of Westland. Hiring more Police and Fire Staff will be beneficial to Westland.  Fifth: Lead Water Lines: Any lead water lines that is found should be replaced immediately. The resident should be informed immediately. Westland should be working with the State of Michigan on future funding to replace lead water lines as they are found.  Sixth: Businesses: To many businesses are leaving Westland. The big chain business is nice  but we also need our small business to open in Westland and stay. A lot of residents leave the city to go to Canton Plymouth Northville and Livonia to shop and eat at their local diners. What do they have that we do not  a Downtown? Something Westland needs. A place where people can walk to shops and diners. A place where we can have a craft and art fair. A place where businesses can prosper. By doing this we will attract new and unique businesses and residents will stay to shop and dine here. As for what location I believe having the residents input on this is the best route. Should not be left to a small group to decide what area for a Downtown. I believe working together with the residents we can develop a Downtown in Westland that will have other communities talking about our achievements success and coming to our city to shop and dine.  Now for our mall. It needs serious help. I believe if we help the small business stay here in Westland it will benefit the mall by bringing more quality business to the mall. Westland council needs to be aggressively active on this. If the mall is to be closed Council needs to be prepared for this and have a plan ready.  Seventh: Seniors: We need to do more for our older adults. These are the people that worked and help keep are city going. We need to help them stay up to date with their Medicare. Changes in Medicare happen every year and is very confusing. The city has a seminar for Medicare but we need to do more. There should be more access to MMAP (Medicare Medicaid Assistance Program). Meals on Wheels: Meals on wheels should not be limited to just weekdays. Our older adults should be getting meals 7 days a week if needed. Some of our older adults living on their own that need these meals should not be limited to 5 days of meals.  Eighth: Transportation: I have talked to some of our older adults. They claim transportation do not run 7 days a week. This needs to change. Transportation needs to be a 7 day a week. I also was told that the waiting time after being dropped off is too long sometimes hours. This is unacceptable and should be addressed immediately . Services need to improve.  Ninth: Programs: We need new and better programs for our older adults. We need to be a leader and be up to date with recreational activities and services. The Dyer and Friendship Center need to grow and be financially stable years to come. This applies with the living center likes Westland Village Thomas Taylor Tower. Westland needs a better Home chore program to help keep our older adults living independently in their homes longer.  Tenth: File of Life: This is a program that has all the persons medical information on it inside a red plastic pocket holder. It has a magnet or sticky side to it to be placed on the fridge. This can help saves lives in an emergency when the Fire Department gets a 911 call to the older adult and the person is unconscious when they get there. This program working with the Fire Department is beneficial to the older adults.  Eleventh: Remembering When: This is a great program Westland needs for our older adults. It contains everything Westland need to conduct a comprehensive fire and fall prevention program for older adults. This program has the Fire Department involve with our older adults. It is centered around 16 key safety messages  eight fire prevention and eight fall prevention that  developed by experts from national and local safety organizations.  Twelfth: Telephone Reassurance: Another great program for our Homebound older adults. It is a friendly phone call that provides daily contact with a homebound senior who lives alone.  Thirteen: Knox Box: This program helps Fire and Police get into the older adults home that is living alone in case of an emergency . It has a key to the home in a locked and secure box that only Fire and Police can get access to.  Fourteen: Healthcare: Prescriptions are extremely expensive. Our older adults that are on fixed incomes need assistance for prescriptions. Westland should work with the state of Michigan to have a prescription assistance program to help offset the cost of their medicines.  Fifteen: Garbage/Recycle: We need to partner with other communities and come up with a creative solution to continue our recycle program at a reasonable cost. We should also apply for EPA grants for recycling. They have put out more than 4 billion in grants. Working together with other communities we can get this done. By Westland n starting an Authority Recycle Program. This will be huge savings for Westland. The Authority Recycle program allows us to run our own recycle program with other communities with huge savings to use for Police and Fire.  Sixteen: Norwayne: The revitalization needs to continue. Westland must continue helping improve the service and relationship with Norwayne. More programs for families and children to help with Health care and recreational activities.  Seventeen: Youth Programs. Westland youth programs is one of the best. It particularly important to keep these programs funded and into the years to come. Giving our children quality time learning sports respect and leadership.  Eighteen: High Water Bills. This has been a huge problem for years. The solution for this is a mass water storage. A water Tower in our city. Other communities have done this and where I work in Farmington Hills we did this back in 2014. Helping the city and residents save 3.5 MILLION A year. Yes 3.5 MILLION. The water tower paid for itself in five years. Originally it was going to take seven years. Water gets pumped at night into the tower at A lower cheaper bulk price rate. Then residents use it during the day. Not only do you have the huge savings. If there a major water line interruption to the city. The tank will keep the water flowing to the residents. This happened in Farmington Hills. A major line burst. Stopping water to the North half of the city. By redirecting the valves we were able to get water to these residents for three days. The other benefit to this tower is placing A Hydro Generator Wheel in the waterline. Producing electricity for the city buildings around it. Taking them totally off the grid. With water coming in at night and leaving during the day. The generator constantly produces electricity. Another huge savings. Westland is going to receive over 20 million dollars from the government this year. Part of this money could help build this tower with quick rewards.  These are just some of the ways of saving money and putting the savings towards our Police Fire lower taxes and supporting our Local small Businesses. Together we can do this.  I am committed to the people of Westland and its employees. I am a blue-collar hard-working Father of three beautiful children. I have lived in this City of Westland for over 20 years. I work for the City of Farmington Hills for over 25 years. Long-term AFSCME union member as Chief Steward. The difference between me and other candidates is I am doing this to help make Westland a better and safer place to live in. I am not a politician and I am not doing this for a living. With my experience working with the city of Farmington hill. I have learned to communicate and work with council  and upper management of all departments of the city to solve issues and make the community a better place to live. Do I have all the answers? No I do not. I am human like everyone else. But with everyone working together and working as a WHOLE community as one we together can solve any issues.  I promise when voted in that I will work for the people of Westland. Helping our community to be a safer and prosperous community. This means all of Westland. Not just parts of Westland.  I will not run for any other office. My main goals are to help Westland. I cannot just sit here in my Westland home of 20 years and do nothing.  Therefore I am running for the City of Westland Council and asking for your vote in the Primary August 3rd 2021 and the election on November 2nd 2021.  There are no problems only opportunities and solutions.  LETS ALL WORK TOGETHER  Paid for by the cte Michael Delph 36500 Ford rd. #340 Westland Mi. 48185-2211,political,Facebook

The Planning Board tonight decided to change the language of the R8 so it could stand. My guess a lawsuit would have occurred from the developer if it had not been upheld. Essentially homes that should have been zoned R15 will now be R8. This is the exact opposite thought proccess of making sure Spring Hope stays Spring Hope as much as possible.  You have part time people working on the future of Spring Hope. If re-elected mistakes like this will continue. The time put in is obviously not sufficient at the moment. How bad will it get as requests for more businesses and zoning changes occur? Their time on these issues will just be spread even more thin. Mistakes like this current zoning snafu can and wi cause infrastructure issues and Spring Hope roads being turned into parking lots twice a day five days a week. This can be fixed and avoided by electing Board members who can do this full time and do their homework before voting on items.  Tonight's decision had more to do with covering up a massive blunder than the wants and needs of Spring Hope residents. There is a fix. It is your VOTE. Allow the town to be turned into a broken up jig saw puzzle or vote for new Board members who can look at this full time and actually look at the data before voting on items.

"Every politician in North Carolina says ""Everyone deserves broadband."" The problem has been that we haven't seen many plans for actually getting there.  A sound plan for universal broadband starts with repealing a bad law from ten years ago that banned cities and counties from installing their own broadband.  Around the General Assembly its called the municipal ban and heres what happened:  About 15 years ago Wilson County wanted broadband. So it asked private providers to come and install it. They said no because it wouldnt be profitable.  So Wilson installed broadband itself. The idea was to make it available to people just like a local utility service like water or electricity. By 2008 Wilson had installed 600 miles of fiber throughout the county and called it Greenlight Community Broadband.  The private providers saw this as the beginning of a trend they didnt like so they sent their lobbyists to Raleigh and the majority party in the General Assembly passed a law that literally bans your town city or county from investing in high-speed internet on your behalf.  It was called the Level the Playing Field Act. The private providers argued that public entities - like towns and counties - shouldnt be allowed to install broadband because they can operate without a profit margin and that puts the private providers at an unfair disadvantage.  The problem with that argument is that these are often towns and counties that private providers have turned down precisely because they cant make a profit installing broadband.  So what are these counties supposed to do? Private companies wont come and now the county is legally prohibited from making the investment itself.  That means the only way broadband can reach them is if the state subsidizes private efforts - which we do with millions of dollars each year but honestly it hasnt been nearly enough to close the gap.  Over half the state is limited to only one high-speed internet service provider and there are some industry forces that would obviously like to keep it that way. But I believe that if your town wants to install fiber it should be free to do so - and we should make clear by federal statute that going forward they will have that freedom.  Let me tell you what this looks like when youre traveling the state.  We just did town halls in every county. At each stop I would say to the crowd Hey folks give me a thumbs up or a thumbs down on the general internet situation here. Is it basically good or basically bad?  We got mixed results depending on where we were in the state but out east it was just an ocean of thumbs down. Thumbs down across the whole region.  Until we got to Wilson. Then everyone gave two thumbs up.  Why? Because Wilson finished installing its public broadband *before* the ban went into effect. And its made a world of difference for their local economy and their families.  So to get to universal broadband legalizing municipal internet is key but theres more to do beyond that - like partnering with rural electric cooperatives which have deep experience in getting low-cost utility service to rural counties. Those non-profit co-ops were created after the Rural Electrification Act of 1935 and they helped revolutionize rural life in our state by bringing electricity out to farming communities. With respect to broadband their expertise and infrastructure have been under-utilized assets.  Then theres simply the matter of scaling up funding for laying fiber. Theres no getting around the fact that we simply need a lot more fiber in the ground. Theres an existing state program to do that but its woefully underfunded. Hundreds of millions of dollars from North Carolinas share of the American Rescue Plan (i.e. the Covid relief bill passed earlier this year) could be used for that purpose - and theres bipartisan support for a state bill that would do that. Then theres the bipartisan infrastructure bill that just passed the Senate which may contain another $100 million for broadband - which is not a massive amount given the scale of the challenge but is certainly welcome.  In parts of our state where low-earth orbit satellite may be the best option (i.e. Starlink) we need to help close the affordability gap for low-income families. These new satellite options came up in conversation most often in our town halls in the west where the mountains make fiber installation more expensive than any other part of our state. The technology here is moving quickly which makes this the hardest part of this issue to predict and plan but early results have been promising and scaling up this kind of service may become highly cost-efficient in the near-term.  We should also strengthen the Lifeline program which exists to help people afford broadband service. Right now only a quarter of families who are eligible for Lifeline currently participate in the program. We need to implement coordinated enrollment so that families who qualify for certain other government assistance benefits - like Medicaid and SNAP - would be automatically enrolled in Lifeline.  ***  So the bottom-line is that there isnt just one lever to pull here but if we just did the obvious stuff - legalize municipal broadband provide modest subsidies to very low-income families and use relief funds to scale-up our fiber investment - wed see tremendous progress very quickly.  Those are the components of a realistic plan that is practical affordable and would be widely supported across our state.  Thats what Im going to campaign on and if elected thats what Im going to fight for.  - Sen. Jeff Jackson",political,Facebook
While I very much prefer to quietly do what I do and since there are people here in Newton that have been asking friends about who I am and what my story is  I will take the time to share some of my story for those that think it might be relevant as it pertains to being a good commissioner.  I was a very happy positive kid. I seldom talk about my younger years publicly. I am one of 5 children that grew up in a 2-bedroom house. Me and my 3 brothers shared a room just big enough for 2 sets of bunkbeds. My dad built a walled area for my sister in an already small living room just big enough for a twin mattress for my sister. We had 1 bathroom for the 7 of us. The entire house was approximately 900 sq.  My parents are now both gone. Dad died 10 years ago and my mom just a couple of years ago. At the age of 7 mom lost her mother to an appendix rupture. At the age of 4 my father lost his mother in a house fire. My mom was shipped off to an aunt and raised by her. My dads father re-married and dad had a step-mother that was awesome.  My dad bought the Standard Oil gas station in Ulysses Ks in 1960. I loved that place. I spent every possible minute there with my father. When I was 6 I was able to wait on customers. Dad built a special set of steps so I could push it up to a car sit on the hood and wash windshields. I wasnt aware enough at the time that I was an advertising prop for dads business  back then all stations were full service  but people flocked to dads business in part because they liked being waited on by a little kid. I quickly learned how to take change and yes  how to count back change to a customer. I really think that started my interest in accounting. So I still do many of my own service station mechanic work as I learned how to fix tires change oil grease u-joints and many other related duties before I turned 10.  Dad worked himself sick in the gas station I really dont remember what illness he had  but he eventually sold the station in 1970 and went to work for the Standard Oil bulk gas distributor. He eventually left that job to drive a truck for the rural trash service in our area  and eventually retired from there. During this time dad became known as Mr. Little League and spent 40 years using baseball to provide a positive influence on the young people in Grant County.  I know that our family was poor. But back then I think everyone was some level of poor. I dont remember being poor  there were families that had big houses that obviously had more money than others  but back then with only 3 channels of TV we were outside all day playing baseball or some other sport when we werent working. I always had a job in high school  worked for the guy that bought dads station most of the time. My high school jobs also included roofing houses bucking bales moving irrigation pipe changing tubes out of an irrigation ditch driving a tractor rogueing milo and anything else that would put money in my pocket. There were just a few families that gave their kids an allowance if I wanted spending money I had to earn it myself.  With 5 kids and a set of parents in a small house  I was more than excited to be off to Garden City Community College after high school was complete. The summer before college I worked for a company that sold grain handling systems and I learned how to pour concrete driveways dump pits and cone pits. I also assembled grain bins and installed aeration systems learning how to weld in the process.  During that first college year I worked for the Butler Building dealer and worked evenings and weekends putting together transport augers and helping assemble buildings and grain bins. The summer after my freshman year in college the owner of the company let me pick my own crew and I erected buildings and bins working with 3 other friends for that summer.  Sophomore year I went to Southwestern College in Winfield. I stayed in the dorm that year and got a job at Gibsons Discount Center (think small Wal Mart). I stocked groceries and was in charge of the fish department. There were probably only 25 aquariums  but it seemed like there were a 100. I was always cleaning and testing aquariums. Constant battle with all the fish diseases but eventually found a rhythm where death loss went to a very acceptable level.  Sophomore summer I started my own roofing company. I had always been entrepreneurial  did lots of things to make money when I was a kid. I also got a summer job at Cities Service Gas company where I worked night shifts in a compressor plant. I had really long days. I would roof every morning until it got too hot to stay on a roof. Then sleep until 6:00pm and crawl back on the hot roof until dark. Then sleep until 11:00pm. Then get ready to go to my night shift at the compressor plant. I repeated this each week-day  roofing on weekends.  Went back to Southwestern for Junior year  and Junior summer repeated the roofing / compressor plant work in Ulysses. I got married that summer (1976) and the most difficult wedding picture we took after the ceremony was the one with Danas hand on mine  showing the rings we gave each other as a commitment to each other. Roofing is not friendly to your hands  getting her hand to cover my hand in a way it didnt look like I had just finished having a death battle with a grizzly bear was not easy.  I also worked my Junior and Senior year in College at Gibsons Discount Center  but added a school bus driving gig to it because I was able to work that into my class schedule.  I graduated from Southwestern College in 1977 with a Business Administration degree with an emphasis in accounting  Magna Cum Laude  with no school debt. My wife still had a year of school left so I looked for a job in Winfield where I might use my education but being too honest with potential employers  our intent was to go back to western Kansas after my wife graduated  kept me from working for any local CPA firm. I eventually applied at Peabody Corporation for a position in their assembly line shaping copper tubing that went onto combustion heating systems. That put my resume on file. I was later asked to move into their accounting department to cover for an employee that was having a baby. When she didnt return to work that became my entry into a full-time position in the accounting world.  We moved to Garden City in 1978 and I went to work with a CPA firm while my wife started her teaching career in Deerfield KS. I eventually moved to Ulysses and had my own firm which I sold in 1999. At the time of the sale I had 1300 clients in 37 states. I currently run a bioscience company that I started in the early 2000s.  I have never forgotten where I come from. I never miss an opportunity to mentor those that are willing to grow using my experiences. I had great mentors along the way. I still have a tremendous drive to good for the world because I know I have been blessed. My wife of 45 years and I have quietly been an influence in the lives of many. We believe that character is what you do when no one is looking.  The problem with local politics is that people have to run for office telling you they are going to fix things in order to get elected. You get to decide if you believe them and vote accordingly. The reality is that there is no quick fix to a problem that has evolved over decades of management (or mismanagement). The only real fix is a long-term pathway where you make a series of good decisions in all areas of city business. Everything ties together. Simultaneously you have to improve how you do economic development (grow your tax base) allow for improvements to your water and sanitation infrastructure get the right people in the right positions and pay them a competitive wage improve your downtown provide amenities that keep people in town provide for housing needs and a multitude of other things that keep a community viable and competitive with other communities.  No one cares about Ordinary Joe more than I do. I was raised by Ordinary Joe. I have not forgotten that people struggle  but I also know that the only way to fix this is to chart a path that keeps the community economically competitive long enough that we can grow our way into lower utility rates. Deviating from that path for short term relief is how we got into this predicament.  I want to continue working for all citizens of Newton. I have a clear understanding of the problem and things will get better if we all have the discipline to stay the course. We have already gone 4 years without a mill levy increase and longer than that without raising utility rates. Together we can do this. We really are on a very good path and I hope you will give me a chance to use my experience to stay the course when you vote on November 2nd.,political,Facebook
Here's what I wrote for the Daily Globe and the Iron County Miner.  I'm James T. Schmidt and I am seeking to serve on the Mercer Town Board. I was born and raised in Mercer. I graduated from Mercer Public School in 2001. I have served on the Mercer Fire Department since 2001. I am currently employed at Action Floor Systems located in Mercer and have been since May 2010. If I have the privilege of serving on the Town Board I will seek two terms.  I am running for the Mercer Town Board because there are some things that I don't agree with. First of all special meetings are held at 9 or 10 in the morning so that there will be minimal outcry from the hardworking people of Mercer who cannot always take off work to attend those meetings. Secondly the sign ordinance needs to be revisited. When it was written it did not allow for any entity in Mercer to have a digital sign. Since that ordinance has been selectively enforced. Three gas stations have digital signs as do the Chamber of Commerce and the Mercer Public School. I believe that variances have been issued to the Chamber and the School but I'm not sure. Other businesses are sent strictly worded letters condemning them for changing nothing but the name on a sign leaving the dimensions the same. We need to move Mercer into the 21st century and not keep it stuck in the 1950s. Businesses need to have the option to upgrade their changeable signs to digital if they so choose. Third of all the snow removal policy that the Town Board forces the hard working Road Crew to follow recklessly endangers the citizens of Mercer. During the last heavy snowfall I received several phone calls about people being stuck in deep snow on the unplowed roads. While I understand that some people want to wait until the snow has stopped before the plows go out I believe that when the snow amount gets to 4 or 5 inches the Road Crew should start plowing assuming that it's a reasonable time of day. If the amount hits 4 or 5 inches after 9pm then I believe that it isn't necessary for the road crew to go out until the scheduled time in the morning. Fourthly I believe in complete government transparency. This is especially important when it comes to the spending of tax payer monies. I will fight for responsible spending of tax payer monies. For example if the Town needs a new piece of equipment the Town asks for detailed bids from multiple dealers those bids should show (for example) one piece of equipment costs $100000 and has a 3 year warranty and another costs $180000 and has a 7 year warranty I would push for the one with the 7 year warranty because it would cost the Town less in the long run. Sometimes spending a few thousand up front could save hundreds of thousands in the future. Fifth of all I believe that we need to expand and maintain our infrastructure. This includes but is not limited to roads ATV and snowmobile trails silent sport trails and properly maintain town buildings. Lastly I will fight against any unfair tax increases. Mercer residents already pay enough taxes and it's not fair to ask them to pay more. I believe that if a reasonable tax increase combined with curbing spending will give the town a balanced budget then the Town should pursue that route. With that being said I will do my best to keep taxes at their current level but I can't promise that taxes won't go up.  You now know my positions and I look forward to working for you if I have the privilege of serving on the Town Board I will not forget that the voters are my boss and I am your employee.,political,Facebook
Hello! I'm Michael and I'm running for Randolph Board of Education. I call my platform the #2040Plan in reference to the year that a child born on Election Day this year will graduate high school and head out into the world. When that day comes what sort of world will they face and how well will we have shaped that child to meet the challenges of tomorrow? I believe the answer to these questions depends on how we as a community address the following issues:   Technology  The pandemic was a crash course for us on just how much we can accomplish with technology. It also exposed how much we still have to invest in both the curriculum and infrastructure to create a fully integrated technology program that will prepare the students of today for the world of tomorrow. I've spent nearly twenty years in the technology industry and over that time have worked with organizations from small businesses to Fortune 50 corporations to build successful technology programs. My goal is to ensure that every student parent and staff member has the tools training and vision necessary to ensure that our children can thrive in the world of 2040.   Culture  Today's world is more diverse and interconnected than ever and tomorrow's world will be even more so. For today's children to thrive we as parents and educators need to do better at shaping children with a more worldly perspective. Our schools need a greater emphasis on language world history international relations and cultural understanding. My goal is to encourage movement toward a curriculum that treats all cultures with respect and teaches children to view their world and their interactions from different points of view. I support an open and honest conversation of current events based on facts and mutual respect and believe that our children can only benefit from learning to see the world with empathy and understanding for experiences outside of their own.   Talent  The continued success of Randolph's educational programs depends on fostering an organizational culture that attracts and retains the very best faculty. Like any other organization our district's greatest assets are its employees. Ensuring that faculty are free to focus on being the best educators they can be is among my top priorities. How we measure performance and academics from both a student and a faculty perspective is paramount to this effort. I will strive to ensure that the contributions of our faculty are identified and properly recognized. In fulfilling these promises I believe we can drive a culture of excellence and innovation that will guarantee our children's future success.   Transparency  School boards exist to represent the community's concerns to the administration and represent the needs of the district to the community. I believe that the board should consider the opinions and seek the community's advice and consent when dealing in matters of district policy and education. This role has never been more critical than it is now in the digital age when communications are more rapid and information flows more freely than ever before. As a board member I will work with my fellow board members to facilitate this process through all authorized means. No decisions should be made in the dark. No board should allow the personal ideologies of its membership to trump its obligation to be servants of the community. This sense of civic responsibility is crucial not only to the proper functioning of the district but also in setting the right example for our children to become good leaders amongst their own generation.  Finally I am poignantly aware that our community has been through a lot lately. I pledge to you that I will work to build bridges provide principled leadership and at all times be ready to listen empathetically. I have great faith that our community is as resilient as they come and that all of us simply want the very best for our children. Though we may not always agree we can never forget that we are a community and that all members of our community deserve respect. I therefore promise to maintain a respectful dialogue throughout this process toward the current Board members other candidates and the community. To at all times focus on helping Randolph heal the divisions that have threatened to tear us apart so that we can return to keeping our eyes on the future of our district and our children.  My door is always open and I encourage a public and transparent campaign among all candidates. Any resident is welcome to a private or public conversation on these or any other issues. I look forward to getting to know so many of you that I've not met yet and to giving my all to help ensure that our children receive the very best educational program we can provide.,political,Facebook
"Greetings Citizens of Allegheny Township! In this post I will address my work on the first of the five planks in my re-election platform: ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT!  From 1993 until its dissolution in 2013 I served on the board of the StrongLand Chamber of Commerce. A major focus of StrongLand was bringing commerce to our region and making sure we had an educated citizenry to meet the needs of new businesses. We worked to stop of flow of young people out of our region. I proudly served as board president in 1996. Then WEDIG Westmoreland Economic Development Initiative for Growth took up the cause. I served on that board until it was interrupted by COVID-19. Simultaneously I served on the the Westmoreland County Planning Commission two-year work study with eleven municipalities in our northern part of the county. The whole county is facing the same problem we have in Allegheny Township. The goal was to find ways we can improve life for our people economically and financially and discover opportunities for working together. That work was finalized in the fall of 2020. The final plan is called Remaking Our Westmoreland. You can review the final document by googling ""Remaking Our Westmoreland"". Briefly outcomes of the study that specifically address economic development are: 1. Establish criteria and develop and maintain a listing of development ready sites and work with local business and civic leaders to market these properties. 2. Remove barriers to development by standardizing and streamlining the development process. 3. Develop a master plan for vacant or aging commercial properties. 4. Establish guidelines for beautification including landscaping lighting and facades. Since my family owns and operates four businesses right here in Allegheny Township it is vitally important to me that we work hard together with our surrounding municipalities to improve the business environment and not just give lip service to it. The complete upgrade of the western end of Route 356 is a giant step toward our commercial success. And that is thanks to our constant lobbying to PennDOT to get on the Transportation Improvement Plan and now finally the Construction Plan! Finally the one-square mile Towne Center Zone in the heart of our township was formed specifically to give businesses easy access to infrastructure and permitting needs. Specifics on my other four planks will follow on future posts.  Kathryn Starr",political,Facebook
Great we get a $1.2 trillion dollar boondoggle that gets to be signed by faux President Biden. Im sure this money will be well spent on infrastructure.  How about having someone over see this spending crap to make sure it gets spent appropriately? How about a reporting to the American people that its efficiently spent? How about accountability (besides voting) holding these politicians that benefit from this financially getting jail time?,political,Facebook
Fellow residents I am running for re-election to the Select Board with the hope of continuing to seek solutions that would improve our quality of life.  With over thirty years of public management experience working in senior management positions for the Commonwealth as well as over twenty three years in various elected and appointed roles here in Holliston I wanted to bring my skills to seek collaborative and sustainable changes.  Three years later we have managed to navigate a pandemic and the impact it presented to keep everyone safe and informed. Yet despite this unprecedented public health emergency weve made significant progress with the passage of several initiatives that provide a solid base to build upon including;  Our water and public infrastructure. The Town approved three initiatives to improve our water and public infrastructure. These studies will give the Town proposals to;   accelerate the water pipe replacement program   find new well water sources   plan for new sidewalk infrastructure that would open safe passage from our neighborhoods to the core businesses and center of our Town.  Sustainability Coordinator position. We created this position to help Holliston become more environmentally conscience and to use natural resources more responsibly. This role has helped us source renewable energy options for consumers of energy and expanded the curbside pick-up of compostable waste. Were also poised to accept the new solar array project at the Town transfer station that will provide almost $500000 in new revenue to our Town!  Facility Manager position. Our new Facility Manager has quickly assessed all Town owned buildings and has begun identifying projects to maintain these assets. This role in conjunction with the Sustainability Coordinator has also performed energy audits on natural gas and electricity services that resulted in a combined savings of over $85000!  If re-elected I will focus on three goals;  1.) Continued infrastructure improvements. Our Town-sponsored studies will be delivered in 2021. We will have the chance to examine the impact and cost of improving our infrastructure and to present meaningful solutions for these long-needed and critical projects. These projects will improve the quality of our water supply delivery system roadways and sidewalk system.  2.) Evolve our governance and management model. It has been almost thirty years since we have made any attempt to improve the way we govern ourselves. Using local volunteers with extensive experience in public sector management coupled with state-assisted experts on financial management processes we must identify ways to streamline the delivery of services to provide more effective results for Holliston.  3.) Stability in governance. While I am just finishing my third year I am the senior person on the Select Board. I ask for your vote to serve another term to provide continuity and experience to ensure our new Town Administrator and residents receive the most effective leadership our citizens deserve!  It has been an honor to serve you! I look forward to serving you for another three years to improve our quality of life. I ask for your vote on May 25th! Thank you.,political,Facebook
CAMPAIGN PROMISES ARE ALL THAT MATTER  I feel that a campaign promise is a sacred vow to those we aim to represent. Fulfilling those promises is all that matters. Instead of using campaign catch phrases to win an election four years ago we decided to make real world applicable campaign promises.  I pledged to make developers build our unsafe half streets on 45th/Longs Peak to take on metro districts to lower our tax burden and to find out why our water bills were so damn high. We are very proud to say that every single campaign promise my team and I made four years ago has been realized!  Regardless of all we have done the anti-recall old guard will stop at nothing to silence us. We beat them out of office and took back our City Hall once before. Time to do it again!  The candidate they have pulled out of the woodworks to silence our voice is already using their same political catch phrases. This is because he is being sponsored and advised by the same people who fought against the recall. It is time we tell them that we will not fall for this nonsense! We have worked too hard to finally have true representation here in East Brighton. We cannot hand this Council seat back to the old guard.  I will highlight all our accomplishments in coming weeks to demonstrate what we have done to improve the quality of life here in East Brighton. The first of these successes is what shook our city two years ago:  CAMPAIGN PROMISE FOUR YEARS AGO=FIND OUT WHY OUR WATER BILLS ARE SO DAMN HIGH?  POLICY RESULT=WE STOPPED THE GOUGING AND LOWERED RESIDENTIAL WATER RATES  To all of you that are new to Brighton or understandably questioning these claims let me show you the evidence that anybody can easily look up. Below is what former Council members (that have endorsed my opponent) did to our water bills while they served. These are facts that cannot be denied:  2010-2011 Council began a process of raising rates that continued for seven straight years.  2011-2012 Council raised rates to pay for necessary capital projects. Utilities was supposed to spend $19.9 Million but they only spent $9.6 Million.  2012-2013 Council raised rates yet again to pay for more capital projects. Utilities department was supposed to spend $7.7 Million. They only spent $1.4 million.  2013-2014 Council raised rates another time. Once again the city is told that they are behind and need more money for capital projects. In 2014 the council gave Utilities $8.3 million. They only spent $2.7 million.  2014-2015 Council again raised rates. The Utilities department was directed to spend a significant $32.4 Million to fix infrastructure utilities projects. They only spent $3.1 Million.  2015-16 Yet again the Council raised rates. They now had $45 Million more to complete projects yet only spent $8.5 Million.  2016-17 Before I was elected they raised the rates one more time. This put $65.8 million more in the hands of our utilities department. They only spent $11.9 Million.  TOTALS:  IN 7 YEARS COUNCIL GAVE THE UTILITY DEPARTMENT=$65.8 MILLION  THE UTILITY DEPARTMENT ONLY SPENT=$11.9 MILLION  77% OF PROJECTS WERE NOT COMPLETED!  THE MUCH-NEEDED WATER PLANT EXPANSION WAS NOT EVEN STARTED!  ALL WHILE HOLDING THIS MONEY IN A SILOED OFF ACCOUNT HIDDEN UNTIL 2019!  This means that over these many years projects were not started and/or completed while they continued to gouge us with high water bills that still cannot be explained. We led the charge to stop this and went on all regional news networks to blow the whistle. In 2019 we were finally able to put this to a halt and lower our water bills by over 8%. Because of how unethically we were billed as Citizens all these years I vow to not raise water rates directly on Brighton residents for as long as I am in office!  Much more needs to be done with our water issues but this was the beginning we needed. I will continue to highlight each of these campaign promises that turned into active policy in the coming weeks.  We will also talk about our future campaign promises that I am hopeful you will recognize as a sacred vow that I will not break.  Thank you all for your support as we continue to turn campaign promises into policy!  In Solidarity  Matt Johnston 720-226-8839,political,Facebook
ENERGY and CLIMATE CHANGEI was recently asked about my view on industrial solar and how we combat climate change/global warming. This is a topic very important to me and I am passionate about. Basically I agree that humans have a negative impact on Earth and we need to reduce our personal carbon footprint on the environment. Negative human impacts include; pollution to waterways/habitat/soils carbon emissions overuse of water and disruption of natural water resources overconsumption of products garbage and lack of adequate recycling facilities etc. Our focus should be on reducing individual energy and natural resource needs at the local level and our homes. I disagree with filling 1000s of acres of high quality farm land with industrial solar period. Agriculture is our #1 economic income and we can not afford to destroy this land for future generations. In some countries farm land is deemed critical infrastructure and I believe the same should be done in Niagara County. Solar energy produced in our backyards will be transferred downstate with very little economic benefit to local municipalities and taxpayers. Billions of dollars of subsidies are being handed out to large corporations some foreign in order to meet unrealistic goals all funded by us taxpayers. I believe we need to return taxpayer money to the taxpayers by incentivizing reducing our energy needs AT THE SOURCE our homes/businesses/vehicles. We should increase tax breaks for home solar/wind systems in order to offset power consumption at the source which will save billions of dollars in upgrades to our already crumbling overworked power grid. Tax breaks and refunds for new windows furnaces roofs insulation etc. Give us back our money so that we can improve our homes and require less energy! We can not talk about increasing green energy production without first talking about reducing our individual energy/natural resource consumption. We need to make our homes more efficient and our vehicles carbon neutral. We all have the same goal To Protect Our Earth but a different path to get to the finish line. I believe my plan is the best path forward will increase jobs in a high paying market reduce our impact on Earth/Climate and enable future generations to continue moving in the right direction.  Thank you for your time and again if you like what you read please share so others can learn of my goals.,political,Facebook
Green Energy FuturesWhere is Nuclear Electricity Generation?  We need energy alternatives to replace electric generation currently provided by carbon. The New Green Deal relies primarily wind and sun for generation of electricity but generally excludes Nuclear solutions. (France derives over 75% of its power from Nuclear). Exclusion may be due to fear based on Three Mile Island/Chernobyl disasters and problems with fuel transportation/waste disposal but be influenced by corporate interests.  Our latest USN operational aircraft carrier class the Nimitz Class has two Nuclear Engines providing safe power and electricity for an entire ship and over 6000 sailors. Engines are said to require refueling after 20 years. Two engines could provide safe electrical power for a small city. New engine designs promise increased efficiency/output.  A new Infrastructure Program could develop an energy solution based on Safe carrier type Nuclear Engine designs or new Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). Program could/should be a Multi-National. Note: Our Power Grid also needs Infrastructure updates to handle increasing electrical requirements. Superconductivity technology is available and could offer opportunities for improved electricity transmission and storage.  Nuclear Infrastructure programs could also apply to our Space Program for the Moon and Mars?  Danny Hamilton,political,Facebook

Amidst the chaos and confusion of infrastructure and reconciliation this week there was a very important vote in the Senate yesterday.  I spent a lot of time this spring talking about my Roadmap to Reform package  it included the No Budget No Pay Act a bill that would withhold pay from members of the US House and Senate if we dont pass a budget and all regular appropriations bills by the October 1st deadline outlined in the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.  A lot of people in DC told me that bill would never go anywhere that politicians would never vote to hold themselves accountable. Yesterday 53 Senators did including 8 Democrats.  Theres an appetite for this in Congress. There is support for reform and its coming from both sides of the aisle. Im really encouraged by this vote in the Senate yesterday and I hope to be able to get my House colleagues on the record on this issue soon.  The American people deserve a Congress that works for the PEOPLE not the politicians.,political,Facebook

Brandon resident Nick Ivy is quoted why hes voting on Tuesday for Our Mayor Butch Lee because of Butchs record of delivering results for our city.  As I ride through Brandon this afternoon and see the plethora of campaign signs from all of the various candidates I cant help but think back a few years ago before our municipal elections.  In 2013 Brandon was struggling with debt had seen few improvements as far as infrastructure our downtown was basically dead and little to no economic development was taking place.  You didnt see Mayoral candidate signs on every corner. We were a little bedroom community with a very bleak outlook.  But Butch Lee then Alderman in Ward 6 stepped up to the job. He took on Brandon when nobody else would.He ran unopposed. He put a plan in place and executed.  When you drive through Brandon today and see all of these signs for these candidates take a minute to look at where we as a city would like to go in 4 years where we were 10 years ago and how far weve come since that point.  Putting on a flashy campaign these days is just a function of money. A college kid with a good laptop can do that no problem. But proven leadership takes much much more. It takes being tough when nobody else will. It takes superior planning skills and the ability to stay the coarse in order to see that plan to fruition. It takes so many different skill sets.  With several candidates in our election this year there is only one person with that proven leadership in Brandon.  As they used to say the proof is in the pudding.  Butch Lee! Our Mayor.,political,Facebook
When collateral has been spread too thinly (rehypothecation) the stability of the financial system is threatened.  Fiscal policy has acted as a band-aid for the problem but as climate change the pandemic infrastructure developments and geopolitical statecraft shape the new foundation for the future and demand new waves of liquidity and credit the consequences of systemic instabilities will materialize.  Read our Tuesday commentary to dive deeper into the risks rehypothecation poses to the financial system.,political,Facebook
The supply chain problems we are having is directly attributed to the reaction to the economic downturn caused by the COVID pandemic. Our government generally stimulates the economy through three methods all of which causes the debt to rise. The first method is to cut taxes to put more money in the private economy. Trump and the GOP did this at a time that in my opinion the economy did not need stimulus. It did make the economy grow but disproportionately benefitted wealthier Americans. The second way the government stimulates the economy is by giving cash directly to Americans. This is a very effective way giving the economy a quick boost but also causes overheating and can lead to shortages and inflation. Both the previous administration and the current one did this which helped prevent a recession. Unfortunately the Democrats doubled down on direct infusion and gave money to parents of young children who are the most likely to use it to buy things. This has caused a huge demand for products manufactured in Asia at a time that the shipping industry hasnt fully recovered capacity. Basically the supply line crises is caused by an economic policy that worked to well. The biggest problem with all of this money going out to parents is it has enabled them to not work. All of this borrowed money is going straight to manufactured goods from Asia while our Service Economy is struggling with a labor shortage. The third way the government stimulates the economy is by spending it on public projects like the proposed infrastructure bill. This type of stimulus is a slower but more measured way for money to be injected into the economy. In addition it has the added benefit of building enduring investments that help maintain the economy in the future.,political,Facebook

What does it say when an entire campaign is focused on consolidating power around one individual who has routinely abstained from voting on issues of importance?  I would expect that Mendham Township residents would reward the leadership that has brought about results. With that thought in mind I am asking that you please cast your votes for Sarah Neibart and Nick Monaghan. I had the opportunity to work with both Sarah and Nick during my time on the Township Committee and although I am very proud of what we accomplished then I am even more impressed by what Sarah and Nick as Mayor and Deputy Mayor have accomplished over the past two years.  Together they have taken a leadership role in moving significant projects forward many of which were stalled out for years. Most notably they have delivered on the promise of properly housing the Mendham Township Police Department a groundbreaking ceremony just occurred. They saw to it that the Pitney Park project moved forward - the grand opening was last month. Additionally under their leadership recreation programming has been expanded critical waste management infrastructure issues are being addressed and an investment in our aging town hall is happening!  And they have accomplished all this with a zero percent tax increase over the past two years. Now that is a record anyone should be proud of and we in the community should support with our votes to reelect both Sarah and Nick. They have worked tirelessly for the benefit of Mendham Township and they have earned our votes to return them to the Mendham Township Committee.  I ask that you please take the time to cast your votes for two of the hardest working elected officials this town has ever had the good fortune of working for us. They know how to get things done. Lets save the participation trophies for the children.  WARREN GISSER West Main Street Brookside,political,Facebook
More and more cutting back of the larger social spending budget bill. First environmental and now needed benefits for elders critical paid family leave and family protection in general. At some point very close to now the progressives are going to say enough is enough and not vote for the flawed deeply cut bill just to satisfy 2 Senators.  As well the infrastructure bill without the critical larger social spending bill will just increase inequality and division. The infrastructure bill alone only feeds and maintains the current structural inequality and dysfunction of the present state of things.  The progressives need to take a stand here. Either pass both in their robust forms or pass neither. Then move more aggressively to pursue our social justice strategy. We need more backbone. Ill take my chances by striving for what is clearly fair and right rather than continue to accept growing inequality in the service of special interests.,political,Facebook
When I ran for the Burgess ( Mayor) of Woodsboro which is the office I currently hold I said transparency is something I promised would happen while I was in office. I will continue the promise of transparency when I am in office as your state delegate. Here is an update for the town of Woodsboro from the September meeting. The grants that I applied for from the Maryland Department of Natural Resources Playground Infrastructure Grant to build a stage/bandshell in the eastern part of the park and to replace the small walking bridge to be replaced with an ADA compliant bridge were approved. The town will be receiving $60304.00 dollars for the stage to be built and landscaping and $18075.00 for the bridge to be built. The contractors have already begun work on the stage. The new bridge will be built in early spring. It was also announced that the town will be receiving the first half of their American Rescue Plan Recovery Funds that was issued by the President and approved by Congress. Initially the town was supposed to receive $767512 dollars which is 75% of the annual budget which is the maximum that a municipality can receive. With the budget amendment of 2019 with the roads that where repaired Burgess Barnes submitted an amendment with the updated budget and it was approved so now the adjusted amount of funds that the town will be receiving is $947817.00 dollars instead. The first half of $473908.50 will be disbursed to the town the week of 9/21/2021 and the remaining half in May of 2022. These funds have very strict guidelines on what they can be used for however water and sewer is one of the options and what the town is need so a large portion will be used toward that. The council will be discussing this at the October 12th 2021 meeting and as always residents and members of the public are always welcome to attend our open meetings. I would like to see a portion of the funds go to help local businesses that were hit hard by the pandemic. More details will be coming on this over the next month. Town Clerk Mary Rice and I met with the architect in late August concerning the new town office that will be built on Main Street. The meeting was very productive and the architect assured us that he would have the final plans by the end of September. The goal is to have approval to start taking bids on the building by the end of October and hopefully to have groundbreaking by the end of the year. It was also announced that Burgess Barnes has reached out to State Delegate Jesse Pippy (who also came out in July and toured the town and site where the new building will go) and State Senator Michael Hough regarding a proposal to have funding possibly placed in the Governors upcoming budget or a possible grant for funding. If this can get approved it would be very beneficial to the town regarding the amount of funds that the town would have to borrow to build the office building. I feel very confident that Delegate Pippy and Senator Hough will work hard to get this on the budget. I am working on getting a proposal to them this week.

I moved to District 1 in 2016 and have grown to love it deeply but I believe that residents deserve a more progressive and responsive voice on the City Council. I pledge to be that voice when elected.  Below are some of the issues where my positions are in strong contrast with those of the incumbent. I believe that District 1 residents deserve a strong independent voice that does not automatically agree with our Mayor.  I believe that our trees provide many critical benefits and deserve greater protection. I can only assume that Carla backs the Mayors environmentally destructive plan to build a police training facility in Dekalb. This would destroy the largest greenspace inside the perimeter. She has been silent on the matter. I have been advocating for this site for years and I have the endorsement of the Save the Old Atlanta Prison Farm Organization.  I believe that our streets need to be maintained in much better condition while at the same time be designed to limit high traffic speeds. Beltline Rail should be implemented as soon as possible as it was the will of the voters in the district. I believe that renters like myself as well as homeowners both have serious concerns about rising unaffordability that need to be addressed.  We need to have smarter development in the district. I believe that investments in bicycle infrastructure should be dramatically increased to offer a safer non-vehicular transportation option.  Finally I believe that residents have the best ideas for improving our wonderful District and I want to hear whats important to you at my facebook page and at  Please visit my website for yard sign requests donations and to stay in touch  Thank you for your time and look for forward serving you on City Council in the 1st District,political,Facebook
We are down to the final hours before election day on Tuesday May 18th. When I decided to join this election for school board I had the goal to work hard for the students teachers and taxpayers of the district. My message has been clear. I am a life long resident with children in the school system and want to make Hempfield the best district not only in Westmoreland County but in Pennsylvania. I believe the foundation is in place and we as a district should be striving to be the best. I have a deep passion for this and I believe my life / work experiences have placed me in a position to be an asset to Hempfield. I will be transparent and have been. I have answered every post direct message text phone call and I will always continue to do so. I enjoy posting about the different events in Hempfield that I am involved so everyone can see what are great students are doing that I may be a small part of.  The current board has worked extremely hard to right the ship of past practices and I support them in their efforts. We need to be sure that the correct people are being elected to the board so we continue the path that has helped taxpayers and students. They have held the line on tax increases something I fully intend to do within the means we have. I am against the spot tax assessments. While I do believe everyone should be paying their equal share this practice is harmful to the district and its residents and could deter incoming population from buying residences and property in our district while just not being fair to lifelong current residents.  I commend the current board on their guidance through Covid-19. I understand that we may not have agreed on all the decisions that were made but I feel these were the best decisions for our students within their legal right. We now need strong leadership to continue as we come out of the crisis and back to normalcy. We do not need to look backward but strive to the future.  I have spoken to hundreds of you at your doors and countless have messaged me the hot button issues are clear. As I have stated throughout I am against any school curriculum that may divide us as a nation further. Our kids need to educated to the fullest but we must make sure that this information doesn't have a political agenda and gives our smart students an opportunity to make their own opinions. I am also against male students playing in female athletics. As a father of a high level female student athlete I can understand the detrimental effects this could have on athletics as a whole.  I intend to work with Hempfield Township and local leaders as we need to be a united front. Township leaders depend on the school to be and attraction to the area and the school depends on the township to provide resources for family sustaining jobs that will keep our population at home and attract population from the outside when moving into the area.  I support all extracurricular activities associated within the school and outside the school. Hempfield has resources that can support these functions and we need to be sure that the township and school leaders are working together to provide these resources to all of the activities and all spaces are being utilized.  There are big decision's coming in the next years. A decision will have to be made about the High School if we remodel or build new. Our high school students and teachers deserve better infrastructure than what we currently have. Hempfield will have to spend money on this decision. This should be done without an effect on the taxpayer and if there has to be an effect on the taxpayer it should be the very last option and at minimal expense.  I will bring energy passion and transparency to this position if elected. If you do the research you will see that I have been open and transparent throughout this race and will always continue to do so. I humbly ask for your vote on Tuesday May 18th to continue the excellent track Hempfield in on.  Thank You  Jerry,political,Facebook
A property tax decrease has not occurred in Riverhead in 21 years.  My Press Release:  Supervisor Proposes Zero Percent Property Tax Increase for 2022 Budget and 1% decrease in the Highway Budget:  If approved it would be the first town budget in 20 plus years to not increase property taxes with a 1% decrease in the Highway Budget. Supervisor Yvette Aguiar proposed her Tentative 2022 Town of Riverhead budget this morning that will not increase property taxes. If adopted by the Town Board the budget would be the first one in more than 20 years to provide residents relief in the form of a 0% increase in taxes and 1% decrease in the Highway Budget.  The year 2021 has proven to be a year of progress for the Town of Riverhead Supervisor Yvette Aguiar said. Our plans and vision for our great Town are advancing despite the ongoing financial challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Supervisor Aguiar said her administration instituted proactive measures to reduce spending town-wide as outlined in last years budget. These measures were successfully implemented with the assistance and support of the entire Town Board department head and town employees. As a result I am proud to be able to provide our residents and business owners a proposed tentative budget that will hold the line on taxes she said. Sound financial planning in 2021 paved the way for the stable fiscal position we find ourselves in today. It is these fiscal efforts that have enabled me to reduce taxes in the Highway Fund while keeping taxes in the General Fund and in the Street Lighting Fund to the same level as 2021. This will benefit every taxpayer in the Town of Riverhead and will be the first time in 21 years that property taxes will not increase and in fact will decrease because of lower highway taxes.  Supervisor Aguiars 2022 Tentative Budget provides the Town with the ability to enhance critical Information Technology infrastructure supply body cameras for police officers further the expansion of the Code Enforcement Department continue the updating of the Comprehensive Master Plan and continue the development of our new Town Square along the Peconic Riverfront in Downtown Riverhead. The use of Community Benefit Funds and American Rescue Funds will be used in part to purchase or upgrade much of this critically needed equipment and vehicles and will also provide additional training and equipment for the Towns first responders. These funds as well as unanticipated revenues received in 2021 have enabled me to offset inevitable spending increases including contractual expenses and higher health insurance premiums she said.  Supervisor Aguiar said the primary purpose of this budget was to create a stable road map for fiscal responsibility and future planning. My administration the Town Board our department heads and all town employees will continue to battle the pandemic-fueled fiscal challenges as the pandemic recovery phase continues. Subsequently my administration has proven that it is indeed possible to exercise fiscal discipline while continuing to achieve the momentum to move forward towards the betterment of our entire town.  According to the Supervisor the 2022 Tentative Town Budget reflects my continued commitment to provide fiscal stability with the highest level of services while continuing to fortify the Towns infrastructure increasing public safety and improving the quality of life for our residents our businesses and our visitors.  Supervisor Aguiar Presents 2022 Tentative Budget to the Town Board which would not increase taxes  The deadline to submit the 2022 Tentative Budget is Tuesday October 5 at which point it will become the 2022 Preliminary Budget. The Town Board will have until November 20 to discuss or amend the budget. If no changes are made by the Town Board the budget will become the 2022 Final Budget.  As a result of the Town Board making difficult choices Aguiar also noted that in June 2021 after a random review of 20 New York State municipalities the New York State Comptrollers Office released a report determining the Town of Riverhead adequately assessed the impact of the pandemic on financial operations while developing estimates for significant revenues and expenditures in the 2021 adopted budget. Furthermore for the first time in over two decades Moodys Investors Service upgraded the Town of Riverheads bond rating from Aa3 to Aa2 a significant sign of fiscal stability similar to an individual credit score and a reduction in long-term interest rates.,political,Facebook
The wheels are in motion keep them rolling; Re-elect Knut Sauer!!  Prior to being elected to the Town Board I used to attend town board meetings and there was a sense of lack of transparency. The attitude of the town board seemed to be one of We have no money; we cant do it. The perception was there was always an excuse for why things could not be done. When I ran for election in early 2019 most community members I spoke to were very negative and concerned; nothing is happening main street is in despair our infrastructure is degrading and yet our taxes keep going up was what I kept hearing.  Now there has been an attitude change not only on the board but also among our community members. While we still have long ways to go we are making progress. Instead of the board having a No money - cant do it attitude we are now listening acknowledging and while not everything is possible the attitude is lets do some research and see if we can figure out a way to do it? There is more transparency and communication from town officials about the town business and many discussion and Q&As during board meetings are productive ensuring we share more information with the community about matters on the agenda. While audio is still a challenge and we need to do better we do stream meetings online to try to ensure more transparency.  Running for re-election this time around when I speak with community members there seems to be a lot more positivism and excitement. Things are happening in our town; we are back on the map! Even small things matter get noticed and are appreciated. While I cannot take credit for a lot of the progress I do think I have been a breath of fresh air and a change agent since being elected to the board. I have challenged the status quo asked the tough questions and brought a strong financial acumen to the board. It is not business as usual; we can do better we can do more and we can do it more efficiently. This positive high energy can do attitude may have been uncomfortable for some but it is critical for our beautiful town with its great potential that we embrace this can do attitude.  In 2020 after years of annual increases we put a stop to automatic annual property tax increases and basically had no town wide property tax increase for 2021. We have invested in highway equipment and our highway department has done a lot more maintenance and upkeep of equipment. Our highway garage has had one new roof installed and the second one will be done in the next month.  Our parks committee has been very active applied and received a grant for upgrades at Childrens Park Playground and donations for a pavilion. We have done significant upkeep at the Community Garden and the Douglas Memorial Park received a grant for and established a Pollinator garden.  Our town planning board used to be comprised of the town board members. We now have an independent planning board comprised of great community volunteers who are able to dedicate the required time and effort acquire the expertise needed and at the same time free up the town council to focus their efforts on the many other town needs and challenges requiring attention. I have personally spent a lot of time on researching grants and identified one which has been applied for with purpose to erect a floodwall before the bridge on main street Au Sable Forks. That Flood Wall would protect our businesses and main street from flooding. We are in the process of identifying grants we will apply for to renovate the Band Stand and new LED lights for the Jay Village Green. We are looking at grants for EV Chargers. Some of us are proactively networking with our elected State officials we are no longer silent!  Robbe Bear the Town Code Enforcement Officer has proactively been enforcing the town junk yard law and I think we are starting to see the results from his efforts. It is a tough job but he is making an impact!  It is super exciting to see all the new businesses setting up shop on Main Street in Au Sable Forks. Just a couple of years ago our main street was slowly dying today there is no available store fronts for rent. People are willing to invest in our community again. As a board we need to do more to support the revitalization and new energy on Main Street!  I am proud to be part of a group of residents and local businesses that came together and established a new business association the Au Sable River Valley Business Association. We are making great strides and have over 30 members and are becoming official and recognized within the region.  The Rotary Club of Au Sable Valley organized a very successful Jay Day Fair that exceeded all expectations. Vendor and community feedback was super positive and there was great excitement about another happening in town. We look forward to making this an annual event.  There is a change of attitude optimism is back and the wheels are in motion keep them rolling Re-Elect Knut Sauer: We have a lot more work to do! Thank you very much for your support!

"Relevant Answers to Boston Globe Questions- that never seem to make it into the hit piece editorials  (Supporting Documents Can be found on our website: https://savenonantum.com/in-the-press.html)  When you write that ""Several Newton City Councilors have ...lied about us"" which councils are you referring to and what specifically were the lies?  We recently announced our community endorsements (we are Ward1). Since then Councilors Leary and Greenberg who are from Ward 1 and who did not get our endorsement came out with a statement calling us liars about issues our community is facing. In addition the City Council leadership team of President Susan Albright and Vice President Rick Lipof have also made similar public statements in an attempt to discredit us. (we have provided you some examples for reference there are more if you need them)  Nonantum has always been the gateway to Newton. We are the Number One Village in Newton for diversity and affordability. We are a welcoming place for immigrants and others wishing to make a start in Newton. The data our demographics and socio-economic statistics prove this. Our goal is to keep it this way. The city charter is currently written so that citywide concentrated elite political groups control who is elected in local neighborhoods. Oftentimes those selected officials dont have the best interests of the people of their neighborhood at heart. This insulated group effectively disenfranchises all voters in Newton. They have proven time and again they represent special interests and dont have the best interest of our neighborhood or many other neighborhoods at heart.  The people who are against Save Nonantum are anxious that our bringing the community together in an organized fashion resulted in the March Special Election having record breaking voter turnout in our community. They know that if we do this again it will disrupt their power and cause issues for them throughout the city in the upcoming election. Thats why we started Save Nonantum to enable our community's voice to be heard. Councilors Albright and Lipof know that our residents are not happy with the direction they are pushing the city towards. They know we want a change of council leadership and policy direction. So basically they resort to slandering us in the hope of changing voters' opinions of us. They say we are liars; that none of the issues we talk about really affect our community or worse are not even really happening. They say no one from city leadership is attempting to chip away at our community. Leaders from community organizations from throughout our village have repeatedly told the city of our issues and concerns but the current leadership keep denying the issues exist. It has become more evident every day to the people of Nonantum they needed a strong voice in local politics.  Councilor Greenberg told me she asked to meet with you and you declined. Is that correct?  That is incorrect frankly it's dishonest. We invited all the candidates for the Ward 1 City Council positions to meet with us. She was the only one who declined. I have attached the email exchange to verify our attempt to meet with her. Lack of responsiveness and political misinformation is one of the reasons that Councilor Greenberg has a strong challenger in this race.  Why would you say that you are being ignored by officials if you don't accept opportunities to talk to them?  The premise of the question is false. We have taken every opportunity to meet and communicate our concerns with our elected and appointed officials. Our community is being ignored. We look for every opportunity to communicate with our city officials. Besides Councilor Greenbergs clearly false assertion to the contrary can you give us a time you know about that we didnt talk with a councilor?  We've been ignored when we ask politicians to address our real and urgent concerns. They have always turned instead to distractions and not those real hard city issues that the local politicians should be focused on. For example as mentioned the fire hydrants that don't work resulted in one of our local families' homes being burned to the ground. Parking on both sides of Nonantums narrow streets have repeatedly caused dangerous problems for emergency vehicles to get to emergencies. We have rats flooding our neighborhood & entering people's homes. On Jewett Street for example due to the rapid massive developments happening around us.  This nonsense of we declined to talk is baseless political posturing. Sometimes these politicians say they are willing to meet with us but simply dont in fact ever make it happen. I would have hoped that when council leadership hears something about the community or our group that they would first reach out to understand what's happening before going to social media to denounce our concerns. They have pledged to do their jobs as city councilors to make sure our city infrastructure works that our homes are protected that our children get the education they deserve but they are failing us. Additionally they should listen and respect people's differences instead of attacking people who don't agree with them.",political,Facebook
I wanted to share an update on my most recent work in Washington to support Iowas biofuel industry and promote the use of higher ethanol blends:  1. I helped introduce bipartisan legislation with Rep. Cindy Axne to extend the Biodiesel Tax Credit through 2025. This will provide certainty for our biofuel producers in Iowa as well as truckers who keep our supply chain up and running.  2. I joined Senators Ernst and Grassley as well as Representatives Miller-Meeks and Feenstra in a letter to President Biden expressing our disappointment that his infrastructure proposals prioritizes $174 billion in electric vehicle subsidies while ignoring biofuels and urging him to prioritize biofuels in the final infrastructure package.  Ill always stand up for Iowas biofuel producers in Washington!,political,Facebook
Open letter Prime Minister Hubert Minnis - Cruise Ship Incursions into Our Family Island Communities  The Most Hon. Hubert Alexander Minnis Prime Minister Office of the Prime Minister Sir Cecil Wallace Whitfield Centre P O Box CB 10980 Nassau N.P. The Bahamas Via email primeminister@bahamas.gov.bs  Re : Cruise Ship Incursions into Our Family Island Communities  Dear Prime Minister Minnis  There has perhaps never been a time when good faith communication between Government and its constituents was more important than now. As we emerge slowly from the worst pandemic in a century and the nations economic security remains in peril I understand and appreciate Governments efforts to seize upon the fastest means to place this nation back on her feet. However given the unprecedented burdens shouldered by your government I feel compelled to emphasize what would ordinarily be self-evident. Blind haste and desperation make for bad decisions and bad policy.  The authority your government gave CrystalCruises to penetrate our unique and treasured family island communities carries great risks. I will use Spanish Wells as an example but strong inferences must be drawn from that example and applied to the other intended ports of call.  With no public consultation the people of Spanish Wells were notified via a secret RFP aimed at a few select tour operators that Crystal Cruises had been granted permission to anchor off of Egg Island and ferry as many as 650 passengers to the community beginning the first week of July. For many this information might as well have been news that a huge extinction-level meteorite was hurtling towards the island and would enter the atmosphere on the fifth day of July a deal concocted in secret that would have a cataclysmic impact on their lives. Given the arctic welcome Disney received in 2016 when pursuing Egg Island for an ill-conceived cruise port one would think our government had heard the message loud and clear - Spanish Wells doesnt want cruise tourism.  How did we get from Disney to Crystal? Crystal Cruises is literally the bottom of the barrel. They receive an F for sewage treatment air pollution and transparency on the globally-respected Friends of the Earth Cruise Ship Report Card. Information on water quality is not available. Sadly Crystal is the dregs of the most polluting tourism modality on Earth and your government is allowing this filth and exploitation to flood our fragile and pristine family islands.  While your government may be patting itself on the back for the concierge-like manner in which it materialized a cruise ship from the haze of financial angst that hovers over the nation it is abundantly clear to the residents of Spanish Wells that little or no thought was given to what they actually needed or wanted. Worse still it appears that absolutely no thought was given to the potential economic social and environmental downside of the Crystal Cruise deal.  THE ECONOMIC RISKS: As your government must know Spanish Wells has spent decades meticulously building its own unique enviable and sustainable model of tourism. Do you understand the potential blight the Crystal deal represents to their unique brand? Many Spanish Wells residents have invested their life savings to leverage the islands unique style of escapist tourism.  Spanish Wells visitors come to the island over and over again exactly because it is NOT a cruise port of call does NOT embrace mass tourism and does NOT need or want a sudden increase in visitors. Within the space of a few hours a petition opposing this scheme garnered hundreds of signatures from residents and visitors alike and there is no end in sight.  The vast majority of Spanish Wells people dont need or want the pocket change that cruise passengers spend. They are fully aware that it takes 28 cruise passengers to spend as much as one of their stayover guests. Do you have any idea how much money the islands second home owners spend within the community every year and that they will very likely stay away if the picturesque islands soul bears the unmistakable taint and stink a cruise port of call will bring?  THE SOCIAL RISKS: Did the government give pause for a moment to consider the social impacts of converting Spanish Wells into a cruise port of call? Do you comprehend the pride they feel in their small quaint simple uncrowded and Godly island? There are approximately 2000 people who reside in Spanish Wells. Do you think they actually want 650 cruise passengers (equivalent to nearly a third of the islands total population) crawling around their island?  Moreover it appears your government never gave any thought to the fact that Spanish Wells has a very busy and bustling harbour and waterfront.. Can you even imagine 650 cruise passengers most of whom are in their 60s milling around the waterfront as the islands fishermen struggle to perform their many tasks in some semblance of the manner in which they are accustomed?  Spanish Wells is a small community with limited infrastructure. Do you know how many public toilets there are? Have you even asked yourselves whether the infrastructure is prepared to accommodate a sudden explosion in human activity? Have you ever been to the beach in Spanish Wells? Its empty. Neither the settlement nor its beaches have ever experienced anything close to 650 visitors at once. To Spanish Wells a fleet of tenders coming ashore from the Crystal Serenity may as well be hostile landing craft coming ashore in a surprise attack.  Last did you give any deference to the fact that the people of Spanish Wells revere and love their Egg Island. An assault on that island gem is a knife in the belly of the community.  THE ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS: Clearly your government has given zero thought to the unavoidable environmental impact of this shameful scheme to allow Crystal to penetrate our family islands.  In 2016 Egg Island received international recognition as a Hope Spot designation along with 13 other sites globally. Hope spots are marine areas of ecological significance recognized and promoted for long-term protection under a global conservation campaign overseen by Mission Blue a non profit organization founded by Dr.Sylvia Earl. Egg Island has also been designated as a proposed Marine Protected Area by Bahamas Protected Area Fund as a part of the Caribbean Challenge Initiative which targets the protection of at least 20% of our marine and coastal environment by 2020.  As for anchoring at Egg Island what can I say except for the starkly obvious: the idea is reckless and shortsighted. How has this project been fast tracked without the public consultation mandated by several international agreements The Bahamas on committed to including Agenda 21 and the Sustainable Development Goals or an environmental impact assessment and management plan? Not to mention our own Environmental Planning and Protection Act. Clearly no thought was given to the fact that even an anchored ship such as the Crystal Serenity will disgorge as much air pollution as tens of thousands of automobiles. The propeller wash alone can smother reefs up to 1.5 kilometers away. The impacts to fisheries is also a risk that simply cannot be ignored.  The islands sea bed currently does not bear the hideous anchor scars that now deface hundreds of square acres of the Berry Island seabed after the Bahamian Government allowed cruise ships to anchor there we dont need to add Egg Island to the list. Enough is enough.  I could go on and list all of the likely environmental impacts but I know from experience they bear less weight in your governments view than the above economic concerns. Your government does not see our environment as our most precious financial resource even though we use our exquisite beauty to lure visitors to our country which puts food on our tables.  I urge your government to consider that according to the Economic Valuation of Ecosystem Services in Bahamian Marine Protected Areas (MPA) conducted by BREEF the Nature Conservancy and the National Trust in 2017 the existing network of MPAs is worth $6 billion per year in ecosystem services including crawfish habitat shoreline protection tourism and carbon storage. MPAs provide important sanctuaries to keep healthy populations of queen conch grouper spiny lobster and other marine species that are commercially valuable. Fishing is the foundation of many Bahamians livelihoods; in Spanish Wells it is their life blood. The industry is already under stress due to poaching and other stresses. There is no wisdom in adding more poison to the well. Impediments to conservation efforts could have rippling economic effects.  I reiterate my call from September 2020 for an Environmental Impact Assessment to be carried out on the entire cruise industry that will help us determine the way forward.  If nothing else I pray that this letter will make your government turn and face itself in the mirror and ask whether the Crystal Cruise deal is really in the best long-term interest of our country. Are you helping Crystal Cruises or are you helping us? I want to know. The people of the family islands want to know. In fact we have a right to know.

"Let's talk about Tax baby! Let's talk about you and me. Let's talk about city taxes that you pay and revenue increase! Let's talk about tax...  Okay now that I have your attention :) I've received some questions about property taxes and I wanted to shed some light on the tax revenues that have been collected over the last several years. Here we go!  The County Auditor realized that it was incorrectly reporting tax revenues from fiscal 2017/18 and before because it did not included agriculture taxes and TIF property taxes. So going back to fiscal 2017 the property taxes collected by the city equate to $940002. Taxes collected in fiscal 2021 equate to $1297933 or a 38.1% increase in revenues. So what was the cause of this increased revenue given the levy (tax) rate set by the city has stayed the same?  - Increase in property value. I'm sure many of you have seen an increase in your assessed value by the county in recent years. Dallas county is on the of the fastest growing counties In the state and in the country. Land and property values have increased. As these values increase so do property taxes. - Additional homes/commercial buildings. Since fiscal 2017 at least 54 new homes and have 5 commercial buildings have been built. These new buildings generate additional revenue and are typically valued higher than existing property meaning they produce more property tax revenue. - Tax abatements expiring. The city's property tax abatement program ends at 5 years. That means there are additional tax revenues consistently coming in as these abatements expire.  We know tax revenues have increased but I think the better question is ""Where is that increased revenue being spent?"" The simple answer - INFRASTRUCTURE.  Infrastructure like a $3 million storm water project a $3 million sewer plant upgrade $1 million in new and updated streets $300000+ in water treatment updates and upgrades and hundreds of thousands of additional dollars spent on pipes in the ground to ensure basic services are kept up to date and working.  I realize these things aren't ""sexy"" and don't get written about in local papers or social media posts. We don't hold ribbon cuttings when streets get repaved or take pictures in front of water filters but they continue to get done because it's what the city needs to continue to be a great place to live work and play. Sure the library addition and the pool get the press but the vast majority of tax dollars (90%+) gets put back into ongoing city infrastructure.  So YES tax revenues have increased as the city starts to grow. They're going to continue increasing. But I'm curious what do YOU think about how those revenues are being spent? Leave me a comment or shoot me a message with your thoughts. Thanks for reading!",political,Facebook

Dear Friends & Neighbors  Tomorrow (June 22nd) is a very important day in our city. Its the day we get to turn out to the polls for the Democratic Primary. This is your opportunity to choose who will represent you in the general election this fall.  I encourage you to research all the candidates and vote for those with a track record of doing good here with the best interests of the residents at heart and those with the ability to move our city forward in a positive direction.  Im proud that the Board of Education on which I serve in partnership with our District and State and County officials was able to put forward a budget that resulted in a 0% tax levy increase for 2021-2022 along with curriculum enhancements and facilities upgrades in the face of a pandemic. I would take this experience and strive to replicate this teamwork at the city level.  Its vital to keep things moving forward with the financial restructuring plan currently in place and get our operations in order to reduce and manage our $460M debt.  Its also important to put a proactive long-term plan in motion for our aging infrastructure that is threatening our potable water remediate the sewage pollution damage in our Bay and work on solutions for our parking issues which continue to grow with each passing year.  We have wonderful resources here in Long Beach but we need to focus our vision and our spending. We need to be more mindful of what we do and how we do it.  I ask you to please consider voting for me tomorrow. I am the proud parent of a 20 year-old daughter Sydney and very much want to work toward putting measures in place to ensure she will be able to afford to live and thrive here. Something we all want for our children and young people and for ourselves.  Together we can build a stronger Long Beach!,political,Facebook
My incredible community I am excited to announce that I have decided to run for a second term to represent you on the Linn-Mar school board.  I chose to run in 2017 at a time when the district faced a critical need for additional infrastructure and there was significant anxiety among educators about major changes to collective bargaining laws. I hoped that I could be a voice to help move the district forward and Im very proud of the work that Ive been apart of in that pursuit.  But there is more work to be done!  Our highest calling is in service to others. The question we must ask ourselves is how can we use our god-given gifts and talents to make our communities better? I believe my passion for education coupled with my unique experiences and skill set lend themselves to this position. I feel called to serve in this way and I would be honored to have your vote on November 2nd. Thank you!,political,Facebook
"I am Buz McGuire and I am running for Mayor of Macon. Most folks know me and my wife Cyndy from McGuire's Jewelry in downtown Macon. I have owned and operated the jewelry store of over 36 years. I've been your Alderman At Large for almost 12 years. I've also served in multiple civic and service organizations and on multiple boards during my career including having served as Chairman of the Macon Municipal Democratic Executive Committee and Chairman of the Noxubee County Democratic Executive Committee. Currently I serve on the Board for BankFirst and on the Board of the Noxubee Alliance. I'm also a member of the Noxubee Branch of the NAACP. When you consider my business experience my civic activity and my municipal government service I am prepared to make you a good Mayor.  I also have a heart for people. Before being sworn in for my first term as Alderman I sought the advice of Reverend William Rice. He had been an Alderman and a longtime civic leader and I knew he was the man to offer insight before I began my public service career. We sat in a couple of patio chairs under a shade tree in his lovely yard on a beautiful spring afternoon and we visited for almost an hour. To distill his advice in one sentence it would be this: ""Buz if you want to lead people you've got to serve people."" He talked to me about having a heart for people's needs and that's what I've always tried to do.  So as a businessman my most important goal is to take care of the people's money by making sure the City spends wisely. And as a public servant my goal is to do whatever the City can legally do to make people's lives better.  Currently the City is involved in two big infrastructure projects: replacing the box culvert/bridge on Nate Wayne Drive and working with the County to replace the North Street Bridge. Both of these projects are hugely important to Macon and it is my intent to see both of these projects through to completion.  I also want to repair sidewalks as we can find the money to fix them by repairing the worst spots first on the most heavily traveled sections. Lots of people use the sidewalks in Macon (including me) and walkability is important for quality of life and for commerce. My initial intent is for people to be able to walk safely from downtown to the commercial area on the north end of town (Tem's Grocery - Holcombe Supply). That will be a great start.  I have been working to get our children a splash-pad for the past few years. We have worked with a professional design firm and produced a great plan; the holdup continues to be a matter of funding. Well designed and constructed splash-pads are not cheap and I want our kids in Macon to have a great splash-pad somewhere nice to cool off in the summer heat. I am intent on getting this done and will continue exploring ways to get the needed money.  I intend to sponsor a cemetery organization called ""Friends of Oddfellows Cemetery"" made up of citizens who are interested in the beautification and upkeep of our cemetery. This group could help make sure that Oddfellows Cemetery is kept in a way that honors those buried there by sharing their landscaping knowledge and ideas with our Street Department and it could also be an important connection between the families of those buried there and City government.  I have plans for other projects to accomplish as Mayor of Macon (litter control improved policing etc.) but the projects that I've outlined would be a great start.  I'm proud of the way our current administration has worked hard to upgrade and improve important infrastructure in Macon. Often these improvements are not easy to see but they are intrinsically important. Good water working sewer systems and dependable electrical service are not things that people think about unless they are gone. The everyday work of delivering services may not seem exciting but that's a major part of what the City does. I will be anticipating needs and looking for ways to continue needed infrastructure improvements.  Macon is my home. My father Phil McGuire moved here with my mother Virginia in 1948. He raised his family here and I chose to stay here and raise my family and invest in the life of Macon. Through business and church and politics and volunteer work and civic engagement I have worked with a wide range of people across all spectrums of Macon. Every interaction has taught me something and made me a better person. The people who live here make Macon a special place to live. We are blessed with good people.  I have enjoyed my years as an Alderman learning and serving and voting as one member of a five member board. Mayor is certainly a different position because the Mayor seldom if ever votes on anything. The Mayor's job is to run the day-to-day activity of the City and to present the board with specific ideas to make life better for the people while also being aware of the big picture and the work being done and the money coming in and going out. It is a serious important job and I know I have the knowledge the experience the background the energy and the insight to get the job done. I feel that I have been preparing for this job my entire life and I ask for your prayers your ideas your support and your vote.",political,Facebook
Once again we head off the rails with Government spending. A $2.2 TRILLION spending on infrastructure. Sure....5% on roads and bridges. We cant keep pouring money into these BS pork bills! No more bills over 5 pages!!!!!!!! This is why no one trust Congress anymore. Every time bill comes up it just get filled wit pork projects that only benefits Congress and their family and friends. Enough is enough!!!!,political,Facebook
Republicans are raising hell because 13 members of Congress in their party voted for the infrastructure package. They tried through out Trumps presidency to get an infrastructure bill through Congress and were unsuccessful. In August 18 Republican Senators voted to move this bipartisan bill forward. Of course like any bipartisan bill there is always parts of it either party will complain about but that is what a compromise looks like. The Independence Party supports the Federal government spending money on infrastructure that is sorely needed and creates a foundation for our country to thrive upon. We do not however like the fact that a large portion of this bill is being paid for with borrowed money. Unfortunately that is the one thing both parties I like to call them Republicrats always seem to be able to agree upon. As far as the GOP members complaining about their fellow Republicans supporting something they have been trying to get done just shows how they will always put their part before country. I also include the radical far left Progressives who also held this bill up for months in the category of party before country. All of this points to the need for a third party with centrists beliefs.,political,Facebook
Frankly Speaking  What is the Towns financial status? The Fiscal Stress Monitoring System (FSMS) created by the Office of the NYS Comptroller (OSC) calculates and publishes a fiscal stress score annually for each county city town village and school district in the State. A stress test is a review of our financial standing; taking into consideration our annual audit our policies and procedures and our total financial health. Scores reflect our Towns ability to maintain budgetary solvency with higher scores reflecting greater risk of stress. The lower the score the stronger the financial status and stability. The Town of Ontario Fiscal Stress Score is almost perfect with an extremely low score of 3.3 out of 100. Our independent auditing firm of Mengel Metzger Barr & Company supports this conclusion agreeing this was due to the way the Town Board and I reacted to the pandemic; making the right decisions and putting prudent business practices in place. Along with my 45 years of experience the Board members and I have over 150 years experience collectively in making these types of decisions. And it shows. The COVID-19 pandemic that began in March 2020 had a significant impact on our Town. Revenue projections were grim sales tax collections plummeted our local revenue sources were down almost half million dollars portions of State Aid were withheld without guarantee of restoration. We had to make difficult mid-year budget decisions about how best to meet the communitys needs with reduced or less predictable revenues while protecting public health and minimizing cuts. We had to make tough decisions on furloughing employees and encouraged them to take advantage of Federal and State Unemployment to lessen the financial impact. We did this instead of depleting our fund balance which proved a wise strategy. To my knowledge many other local towns didnt do this and suffered the consequences later. Many municipalities in the State cut back services to be able to divert funds to cover other costs. Our Town did not have to do that we stayed open and ready for business. I applied for The American Rescue Plan program which gives money to municipalities for infrastructure to supplement revenues lost. The Town was awarded $1.1 million payments will be distributed in two payments half this year and half next year. However there are still many unknowns and we must remain vigilant as we are still in unchartered territory. COVID-19 variants vaccine resistance labor shortages supply chain issues among other factors continue to make headlines and could impact sales tax or other revenues in the future. While many other municipalities in the State have had to make one-time action decisions reduce services borrow money deplete their fund balances Ontario has not. These other municipalities have a high stress rating and will not have the flexibility that Ontario has for future challenges. Over time low fund balances weak cash positions and lost revenues will put sustaining functions of their governments and ability to provide services in jeopardy and become a major concern. Even though most local governments managed to avoid a lower stress designation during the pandemic and the resulting economic crisis fiscal stress may increase for them in the next few years if the economic recovery falters. I can assure you that we are being proactive and continually monitoring our finances as Supervisor I guarantee this financial stress will not happen to Ontario. I am extremely confident 2021 will end fiscally as sound as 2020. We currently are in the middle of budget planning for 2022 with proposed budget presentations by the Department Heads at our public meetings. The Department Heads meet with myself and the accountants to go over their budgets. In October the Town Board will be discussing it further and making the hard decisions. Later in the process there will be public hearings on the proposed budget before it is adopted and posted on the Town website. We are committed to holding the budget tax cap to 2% or less as we have done in the past three years while I have been Supervisor.,political,Facebook
Some people may be concerned Im a single issue candidate but thats not correct. The truth of the matter is I have many issues of concern which have been at the forefront of my campaign.  I strongly support funding our infrastructure and core services FIRST. In order to maintain our roads at 70% efficiency they need to be funded at $3.5 million per year. In the past decade we have been under funding our roads by approximately $1 million per year leaving them in subpar condition. Proper funding leads to less significant issues in the future.  The Woody Seat freeway is another example of the problems created by underfunding our bridges. The city is now applying for government money to help with necessary repairs needed to the bridge at Avenue A and Adams. The approved plans attached to the government money will change how traffic flows into Hutchinson from South Hutchinson. The plans will also cut off Avenue B which is a highly traveled road used daily by residents in the south west part of town. If Hutchinson is not awarded the government money our cost to repair the bridge will increase from approximately $2 million to an estimated $9 million.  Our sewer and water maintenance items have also been neglected and underfunded leaving our community in a crisis situation. This crisis created the implementation of the stormwater utility fees which has negatively impacted Hutchinson. In 2015 the city collected approximately $600000 from the community for sewer/water maintenance. After implementing the stormwater utility fee program in 2016 our community paid in almost $2.2 million. This cost has proven too great as we lost established businesses and drove away future opportunities. This program must be restructured.  While the proper funding of infrastructure is one of my main goals Im also in favor of promoting new business to create new revenue and to make sure our first responders have the resources needed to work safely and effectively.  As Ive always said a stronger economy creates a stronger community. I hope I can count on your vote on November 2nd #togetherwegrow,political,Facebook
Thank you Downtown West Chester PA for the Candidate for Mayor Spotlight! Visit their page to view the original post or read what was copied and pasted below! If you have any further questions concerning some of these topics please post it in the comments or send a DM.  ____________________________________________________________________  is a second-generation resident of West Chester. She graduated from both and . Lillian went on to run her familys long-successful business in the Borough and opened up a second West Chester business in 2008. She is a community organizer who has served on the  the  and . She intends to bring a renewed sense of collaboration and unity back to West Chester- to champion the town & all its people with her leadership.  1. Do you think our main street/downtown is healthy and successful? If not what would you do to change that? West Chesters main street/downtown is healthy because our community was engaged in supporting our small businesses throughout this pandemic. The vast majority of our businesses have survived because they have done a great job of pivoting their business models to adapt. I intend on working with Rep. Dianne Herrin and to re-designate Gay St. and Chestnut St. so that we can keep Gay St. closed for years to come from Thursdays through Sundays.  2. How would you rate the boroughs support of small businesses? What else can be done to help promote our locally owned small businesses? The BID needs consistent support from the Borough Council. It would benefit the BID and West Chester to increase the BIDs advertising budget to draw more business to our town. Additionally new events need to be created to initiate vibrant exciting and diverse activities to draw people into our town.  3. How do you feel about the transportation options currently available in our city? Do we have enough options? If not what will you do to increase those? We support the railroad as a long-term plan but we need more public transportation routes now including more routes to Exton and Paoli stations. We also need to increase public awareness of available routes and public transportation options so that public transportation is a logical choice for residents and visitors. I will also work in the private and public sector to increase the number of routes. This will also help cut down on car traffic in the borough.  4. One topic that is always of concern to small businesses is parking. Do you think the borough has challenges with parking? How would you mitigate those concerns or change the situation? The parking challenges need to be re-addressed. This is a controversial issue and its a multi-layered issue that needs to be revisited since the COVID-19 pandemic began.  5. If you could change one thing in our zoning code what would it be and why? Encourage new developments to build higher and increase density to promote the landscape referendum as endorsed by the county. Making sure all new and renovated buildings in the Borough are LEED-certified should be a priority.  6. How do you plan to involve small business owners in the decision-making process in our town? I will add a virtual quarterly meeting for Borough Council with business owners to increase communication.  7. If someone came to you with a proposal to build a new piece of public infrastructure in our city (road bridge etc.) how would you evaluate whether that project was worth implementing? West Chester is an old town. Much of its infrastructure is deteriorating in disrepair and needs replacement. Each incident needs to be reviewed on its merit and immediacy.  8. If elected what three steps would you take to put our borough on a firmer financial footing? I would reevaluate and restructure the finances of the parking situation in the borough. I would also like to increase the cost of the extra trash bags provided by the Borough for residents that go over the limit of two cans and make them more accessible. I am also interested in hiring an outside auditor to come in and take a look at our finances to confirm where we are spending money and where we can cut costs.  9. If you received a $1 million grant to use for the borough any way you wanted what would you do with it and why? Two of my wishes are to repave and beautify the town with a specific focus on extending and making Market Street as beautiful as Gay Street and tearing down John OGreen park remediating the land and building a true green space.  10. What would be your expectation and commitment regarding engagement and communication with the BID through its Board and/or members? I will make sure that I am in regular communication with the BID board and members by having regularly scheduled calls and spending time in our local businesses.  11. How might we work together to help optimize the BID as a municipal authority of the Borough such as through grant opportunities strategic planning and goal development initiative prioritization? I would encourage the BID to work toward diversifying their board and members through recruitment so that it is more representative of the retail and restaurant communities. This will help the BID develop more innovative ideas and strategies.  12. How can businesses and the police department work together to help control nuisance issues in the downtown? How can business owners assist the borough in keeping West Chester as a safe environment? We need to implement a system for enforcement of the noise ordinance.  _______________________________________________________________________  #debaptiste4wc #debaptistedelivers #debaptiste4mayor,political,Facebook

Why run for City Council?  1. Paraphrasing John Stuart Mill Let not any one pacify his conscience by the delusion that he can do no harm if he takes no part and forms no opinion. Evil need nothing more to compass their ends than that good men should look on and do nothing. My answer is I have to step up and be the man that at least tries to make the difference. Honesty is a characteristic that an elected official must have. They must show integrity in their actions and be intellectually honest with their approach to issues.  2. Balanced: I will be a representative of ALL THE PEOPLE not for any special interest group or be pressured and/or swayed by others. My views will be a balanced look at what is needed for a stronger local economy support for a viable plan for a better city infrastructure and ensuring safety for all residents.  3. Committed: I have always been dedicated and gone above and beyond to any position or job assigned. As a member of District 1 City Council I will dedicate the time energy and effort for all. I will make myself available for everyone and anyone to listen answer questions and hear concerns and ideas. I have already started reading voluminous amounts of materials to better understand what is happening in Washington.  4. Motivated: My ONLY MOTIVATION is to serve the citizens of District 1 and Washington GA. I do not have AN AGENDA or a special interest group trying to get me elected. I will be a city council person that works for the interests of the community and nothing else.  5. Experience: My life has provided me the needed experience to lead. Whether it be in combat as a United States Soldier or around a boardroom table. I have been in corporate offices discussing budgets and working on multimillion dollar projects. I feel as though my life experiences have certainly enhanced my ability to lead.  6. Electable: I feel my personal values traits and qualifications make me a great candidate for city council. I know there are no issues with my past that would make you stop and think I am not an electable candidate.  In a little over one month we will be going to the polls to vote for 2 two District 1 City Council positions. All I ask is that you think about those who have served and what they have or have not done for you as a citizen of District 1 and for the City of Washington. What is their character motivation experience?  Vote Bruce Bailey for District 1 City Council!!!!!,political,Facebook

"Just yesterday I corrected lies that have been spread about me by other candidates on the ballot. That was the third and I had hoped last time I would need to set the record straight in response to significant efforts to spread misinformation about me... I didn't think it would happen again so soon.  Today a NH online political tabloid called the GranitGrok posted an opinion piece filled with lies. I hope you'll forgive this lengthy post but there's a lot to unpack.  First the author asserted that I have said I felt there would be a conflict of interest on matters before the Board of Public Works relative to the area of Downtown Nashua. They wrote that I have committed to recuse myself of anything of that nature that should come before the BPW. Both of these assertions are flat out lies.  From the article: ""Mr. Shea acknowledges his conflict of interest and promises not to vote for anything related to downtown. That prevents him from voting on many issues such as downtown sidewalks barriers snow removal and any other downtown City plans.""  I said it once last month and I'll say it again ""There are no matters of funding or other possible benefit relative to the organization (Great American Downtown) that come before the BPW and there haven't been in my 6 years of service. In the very unlikely event that any matter before the BPW was relative to funding for or some benefit to the organization I would absolutely abstain from a vote on any such item. That would be the right and only thing to do.""  You can read my whole response at the link below in the comments below.  How long will it be before we see an expensive direct mailer sent to every Nashua voter telling this same lie? I'd give it a week.  My experience in this line of work and familiarity I've developed with city infrastructure and services over the years will be an asset to the discussions and decisions of the Board of Public Works. Just because something has anything to do with Downtown Nashua doesn't mean it has anything to do with me or the organization I work for or create a conflict. Great American Downtown has a mission of vibrancy we do community events we do promotions and help to facilitate a community dialogue about what we want to see in our Downtown.  Does my employer benefit from the outdoor dining barriers? No. Plowing the streets? No. Does my employer benefit from the hanging of Christmas decorations pole banners planting flowers or installation of crosswalk signals downtown? No. Does my employer benefit from paving the streets filling the potholes or keeping the sidewalks in good condition Downtown? No. We also have no funding requests before the BPW or that have anything to do with the DPW.  Am I more familiar with the desires of our small businesses and broader community than any other candidate on these Downtown issues? Absolutely. Does the DPW work around us performing their duties in the Downtown? Of course and it's no scandal but some want to make sure you think that it is.  At first it seemed like perhaps these folks had a misunderstanding of policy process and how the city does business. Having been corrected for some time with the facts before them we are now in a place where I am confident that this is a willfull perpetuation of lies for political gain.  Before I submitted my paperwork to be on the ballot before I even had a chance to tell my mother I decided to run Laurie Ortolano and her supporters were on the attack in various places on social media asserting that I had a... wait for it... conflict of interest... and shouldn't run because of it.  Now Laurie Ortolano does not have her name attached to the article on this niche webpage. She does however have a significant relationship with and a good many articles she has authored on the site about half of which are targeted at and casting aspersions on individual city employees! The fact that the person who does have their name attached to the article is a first time publisher to the site and is parroting a whole set of misinformation that originates with Ortolano is suspect in my view.  Secondly the article asserted ""Mr. Shea has substantial interaction in directing public works employees performing decorating duties for all downtown events. This could create a difficult situation since the Board of Public Works (BPW) is an employer board responsible for personnel matters. As such any misunderstood employer/employee interaction could result in a grievance.""  I don't direct public works employees. Full stop. Their Director or Foreman does that. I make permitting requests for community events and programs. City employees perform their relative functions in relation to these programs as they would for any other community oriented program that uses city parks/facilities or involves a park or trail clean up.  If the author had a genuine concern about appropriateness when interacting with city employees and potential personell grievences one might think she would have written an article about the concerning pattern of disrespect Ortolano has demonstrated:  -She's refered to a city employee in a public meeting as despicable and using the C word. -She has hired a private detective for $8000 to stalk another city employee and then followed them around for three days herself proudly hiding under a hoodie long gloves and sunglasses as to remain undetected. Taking surveillance photos from her car. She would go on and file a criminal complaint against this person only to have Nashua PD clear later his name. -She has four active lawsuits against the City. -What about writing blogs online with pejoratives cast upon even more city employees? -How many of Ortolano's Right to Know requests which I would wager have cost taxpayers at least a few hundred thousand dollars have overreached into a broad request for city employees correspondances? It's her right - but at some point it becomes an abuse of the system and of the employees who are obliged to meet her every RTK whim. -How many city employees have quit or retired early because they are sick and tired of having Ortolano show up to city hall first thing in the morning with a bagged lunch sometimes a few days a week and demand that they satisfy her relentless and wasteful request for documents raising their stress levels and taking them away from the real work serving the public that they signed for and gives them a sense of service and purpose?  Where is the concern for this pattern of behaviour for the violation of boundaries and what real implications there are for introducing someone who operates like this into a position of actual responsibility?  Finally - and this is another talking point that is coincidentally repeated again and again by Ortolano and now by the author of this blog that I will address:  I am not some sort of sycophant for Mayor Jim Donchess.  Though I respect the Mayor I've disagreed with him before quite exhuberantly organizing against his interests and I have no reservations about doing it again. I fought against the Mayor and BPW Commissioner Tracy Pappas (who I am running against in this cycle) to get a new fully accessible Legacy Playground installed at Greeley Park which happened to be in their neighborhood. I organized a petition and rallied supporters to speak publicly in favor of the project. Sadly we lost that fight. I still hold to this day that it was placed at an inferior site and not at a site chosen by the consultants the city paid (wasted) thousands of dollars for advice because of their NIMBY medling primarily because of their approach to the issue.  What astounds me most about the repetition of this lie is that I didn't even support the Mayor when he ran for his office. I was part of the early exploratory committee for Chris Williams as he considered running for Mayor and supported him in that cycle. I've disagreed with the Mayor a good many times since then I just don't feel the need to seek approval from others and toot my own horn every single time I do nor feel a need to sit on the floor of City Hall until the police come and arrest me to make sure that my disagreement clear.  Ortolano and her supporters should start to focus on what is important to her and what she stands for instead of originating gossip about me and calling it a campaign promise. We see this kind of behavior on full display every few cycles in our elections here. What history tells is is that it is not how you earn the trust respect and support of the Nashua voters.  If you made it this far thank you for taking the time to hear me out. If you're an undecided voter in this race and took the time to read this as you do your research on candidates and make your informed choice thank you again. It's not easy running for local office as I've learned. It's also not easy to sift through the flood of information about those running as it becomes readily available for just a few short weeks and get a good feel who you are voting for.  It is important that we have a good balance of thoughtful people representing the best interests of our community in each and every committee and board here in the city - and the only way we get that is when voters take the time to learn about candidates their character and what they stand for. I appreciate you. ",political,Facebook

A fantastic week in the House of Delegates!   The House unanimously approved House Bill 2368 known as Mylissa Smiths Law March 23. This bill was named in honor of a Kanawha County hospice nurse who contracted COVID. The measure would establish guidelines for the frequency of allowable visitation so patients could see family members clergy or hospice while complying with all applicable procedures already established by the health care entity.  Mylissa had a true nurses heart and caring for people in their final years through hospice was her passion said Delegate Dean Jeffries D-Kanawha and lead sponsor of the bill. This bill will never wipe clean the images of lipstick prints and tear stains left on the windows of our nursing homes nor will it return the lost days that should have been spent comforting loved ones. There are too many stories like Mylissas and too many of our frontline heroes have carried the burden of this pandemic day after day. I can only pray that going forward we have done all we can to ensure humanity is preserved for those in need in times such as these.   The House passed the 2nd Amendment Preservation Act which protects West Virginians and Law Enforcement from enforcing federal gun laws that arent encoded in state law. The bill passed 74-22.   House Bill 2630 which would require the West Virginia DEP to reimburse certain fines paid by towns villages and communities also passed the full House March 23. Its lead sponsor Delegate Charlie Reynolds R-Marshall said he hopes the bill can become law to support community improvements throughout the state.  Ive heard from so many of our small towns that they dont have the funds to correct some of the problems theyre getting fined for by the DEP and those bills just compound the problem Reynolds said. This is a way the DEP can still carry out its objectives while allowing our cash-strapped communities to actually fix some of their infrastructure issues.   The House completed the Second Chances at Life Act which would require a pregnant woman seeking a chemical abortion to be informed that it may be possible to stop the intended effects if the second pill has not been taken and she changes her mind but time is of the essence. The bill also would require the woman to be notified among other information already in code that the father if his identity can be determined is liable to assist in the support of the child including paying 50 percent of medical expenses that began at conception.   One of several bills from the House of Delegates meant to help our first responders military members and veterans is HB2874 which unanimously passed the House this week. This measure would add Active Military Members and their spouses to the successful Boots to Business program through the West Virginia Secretary of State. This would offer a waiver of initial business registration fees and certain annual business fees to active-duty military members their spouses and immediate family members when they start businesses in West Virginia. The state has a host of active-duty military members and this would help make West Virginia the easy choice for those families.  Military Spouses in particular are a group in our community that are often unemployed or underemployed due to the nature of their spouses service said Delegate Kayla Young D-Kanawha and lead sponsor of the bill. Its a great way to say thank you to those who protect us along with their families who make it possible.   The House completed the Anti-Discrimination against Israel Act HB2933 March 26. This would prohibit a public entity from entering a contract with a company without a written certification that the company is not currently engaged in and will not for the duration of the contract engage in a boycott of goods or services from Israel or territories under its control. The Act would not apply to contracts with a total potential value of less than $100000 or contractors with fewer than 10 employees.  Thirty other states have enacted similar legislation and its Lead Sponsor Kayla Kessinger R-Fayette said the bills sole purpose is to take a strong stance in saying West Virginia will not use taxpayer dollars to help fund efforts to delegitimize and eliminate our closest ally in the Middle East.  I introduced this legislation for the first time in 2018 after coming back from Israel. I had the opportunity to meet with members of their community and prior to going there I was completely ignorant of the Boycott Divest and Sanction (BDS) movement Kessinger said. But after hearing from so many of their business leaders it truly brought to light this problem even here in West Virginia where weve had millions of dollars in exports to Israel.  I understand that on its face it may not seem relevant to us in West Virginia but after my visit I understood just how important the existence and security and strength of Israel is to the protection of the United States and West Virginia. We share military intelligence on counterterrorism and technology when it comes to advancing the way we protect ourselves at home and abroad.   The House passed several small tax cuts including the domestic animal tax and the municipal amusement tax.   House Bill 2981 would require the Department of Veterans Affairs to develop a suicide prevention assistance program.   The House passed economic development tax credits for small businesses in the state of West Virginia.,political,Facebook
Budget Questions?  An example of my business training and experience helping with the business of Clinton is my ability to review and understand the City budget. The budget is complex. I have often raised questions and issues with the budget. I believe that there are budget issues that could be addressed better than they have been addressed. Even when I have been out-voted I believe that raising the issues and having transparency with the spending of your tax dollars is important.  One of my major concerns with the budget spending over the past several years has been with infrastructure needs. At times I feel like I have seemed like a broken record in raising the issue of street paving.  Several years ago the Mayor and Board of Aldermen met to discuss street paving. After study and discussion a plan was developed to work toward the goal of paving one-tenth of the streets each year. The average life of a street is ten years although some may last longer or shorter based on travel and other conditions.  Some thought that providing one million dollars in the budget would be sufficient to address the one-tenth of the streets for paving. Initial budgets worked toward that one million dollar amount. However when I saw that one million dollars did not come close to paving one tenth of our streets I sought further review.  Clinton has approximately 187.5 miles of streets to maintain. Approximately 30.5 miles of streets are State Aid eligible roads (such as Highway 80 and Northside Drive) for which the State can maintain although City matching funds are sometimes required. Therefore 157 miles of streets are the sole responsibility of the City. In working with the City Engineer we learned that paving one tenth of the streets would cost more in the range of 2.5 to 3 million dollars.  Over the past several years Clinton has received several one million dollar grants from the State Legislature to assist with street paving and infrastructure. If each of the one million dollar grants had been added to the money in the budget we would have come close to the street paving goal. However the million dollar grants were diverted to other things. I opposed each diversion.  Over the past several years Hinds County has assisted with street paving in Clinton. Hinds County can be thanked for paving Springridge Road Clinton-Raymond Road part of College Street Clinton-Tinnin Road Cynthia Road and Neal Street. State funding provided for the paving of the Clinton Parkway.  While we have seen some street paving with the most heavily traveled being provided by the State and County we are not addressing sorely needed street paving. The most frustrating part is that we have had the opportunities to make progress on the ten percent goal and have diverted the funds.,political,Facebook

There are some things from last nights meet and greet that I think need a little more in-depth explanation so you the voter can make a better-informed decision. I apologize in advance for the length of this but I had several thoughts I felt called to put in front of you. Please take the time to read it even if it takes several sittings. Im still going door to door and I hope to finish that process soon but early voting starts September 17th and this is one of the best forums to reach lots of people quickly. If you like what I have to say let me know. Like and share this page. If not and you have concerns please reach out and give me the opportunity to address them before you cast your vote. Thanks for opportunity and again my apologizes for the lack of brevity.  I have known my opponent for several years with our paths crossing numerous times both in our private lives as well as our professional ones. We have lots of mutual friends and I share their respect for him and all the things he has done for this community. I hope that respect is mutual and remains at the end of this campaign regardless of the outcome. He said early on that he is running this race for the office not against anyone and I concur.  We both have a history of community service having coached sports served on boards and committees and done lots of other things with the goal of making Bristol a safe and enjoyable place to live.  He is running as an independent candidate and I as a Republican. He did not get the opportunity to explain why he is running as an independent Monday night; five minutes is not much time nor did I get to explain why I am running as a Republican. I think the public has a right to know what they are getting in an elected official and the party I most identify with is the Republican Party. I believe in small government especially at the federal level believing we do a much better job of governing ourselves at the local level. I believe in being fiscally responsible a belief that is especially important in our community at the present time. I believe in our Constitution and the rights it affords us. I am a staunch supporter of the Bill of Rights and believe the 2nd Amendment gives us the ability to insure we are able to freely exercise the remaining rights. I am an NRA life member a concealed carry permit holder and I enjoy teaching people to safely and properly exercise their right to own and carry a firearm. I have strong moral convictions rooted in my Christian upbringing and faith and think we are best served by treating people fairly but holding them accountable for their actions. I believe in being transparent and forthcoming and in making sure Im available to the public to answer their questions or address their concerns. I believe elected officials should remain accountable to the people who elected them and not abuse their office or the public trust. These qualities are not always the most important factors to voters at the local level. In this election many of you are being asked to choose between two people whom you know maybe well maybe only peripherally. Sometimes votes are cast simply because you have known someone for a long time and believe they will do a good job. I realize that but when people cast a vote for someone they should have as much information possible regarding where that person stands on the issues they see as important their background and their qualifications for the office they seek. I believe I best serve that philosophy by running as a party candidate.  We both have a history of law enforcement service; he with 21 years with BVPD me with 29 years with BTPD. But our law enforcement careers have taken different paths and it is that difference that I think has provided me with the knowledge and experience necessary to lead the BVSO into the future. I have more than 19 years of supervisory experience and almost 15 years of experience at the managerial level. The Sheriff is responsible for lots of things that additional experience has prepared me for. Ive drawn up and managed budgets written grants developed and implemented policy developed and implemented training dealt with a wide variety of personnel issues developed schedules and staffing plans developed bid specifications and purchased equipment and lots of other things that have prepared me to be the next Sheriff. While I have had lots of help and mentorship during my career I did these things on my own and have many years of experience doing them.  Education wise I have both an AES degree from Tri-Cities State Technical Institute as well as BS from ETSU in General Studies. While Im proud of the fact I earned that BS degree while working full-time as a detective as well as being a full-time father and coaching several sports I am most proud of graduating from the Southern Police Institute in 2001 at the top of my class academically. Out of almost 60 students I was the only one that did not have rank. Several in my class were deputy chiefs majors or captains. We even had one Chief. Those same people also voted for me to receive the class leadership award. That achievement has only been duplicated a very few times in SPIs history of almost 150 classes. John Austin and two members of his staff are also SPI graduates as well as one of BTPDs new Majors.  I am humbled to have the support of the three prior Sheriffs. Two of them of have contributed to my campaign financially. The two that live in the City have supported me by allowing me to put a sign in their yard and have pledged to vote for me. In addition I have received support from many of the current and former employees of both the Sheriffs Office and the Police Department as well as people who work within the criminal justice system. I have relied heavily on their wisdom and guidance in managing this campaign and making plans for the future should this campaign be successful. As some of you may know the entire command staff of the Sheriffs Office has either retired or has plans to do so at the end of this year. This makes it even more important the next Sheriff has some administrative and managerial expertise going into the office. It will take time to fill those positions and train the selected personnel to do their job. Even if the jail is closed that process will not happen overnight. The responsibility for running the jail properly will still be there. One misinformed decision can seal the fate of the jail and/or cost the taxpayers money we can ill afford. I have talked with some of these people and feel I have if elected convinced them to stay at least for a short period to allow an orderly transition.  My opponent addressed the jail issue and his hopes in being able to retain it. It is no secret that I want to see us maintain a jail here as well and feel doing away with it completely is a short-sighted decision and one we will likely regret. But having spent time talking about this with the two most recent Sheriffs I feel I have a better grasp of this issue than my opponent. He stated he wants to try and see what the cost would be to renovate and/or expand the current jail at its present location. Both those options have already been explored and deemed too costly. The jail is currently grandfathered from having to meet current Department of Corrections (DOC) regulations in lots of different categories. Should the City choose to renovate we run the risk coming out from under those grandfathered regulations and thus losing certification. If that happens we have no choice but to find somewhere else to put our inmates at least until we come into compliance. This would make the decision on what we do with the jail even more a matter of dollars than it is now. Frankly I believe this is one of the fears that is driving the move to the regional jail system and I cannot discount it as a valid one. Any work to the current facility needs to be done in a manner that insures we stay under the grandfathered regulations. It does not mean we cannot renovate but it severely limits the extent of those renovations. I do not like to deal in absolutes but I do not see a way we can upgrade the capacity of the current facility without running afoul of DOC regulations.  I think as did Sheriff Maples that we can spend some money keep the grandfathered certification and keep the current facility open for a few more years. If we can achieve this we save some of the jobs and we keep our police officers in Bristol instead of them having to drive to the other side of Abingdon to process their arrestees. We buy ourselves time to explore other options. Im not sure Bristol Virginia will ever be able to afford nearly $100 million to build a new jail. With close to that amount in current debt it will be years before we could even contemplate it and that is years of increased tax revenue from the casino and associated development being put towards paying down our current debt. Never mind that we also need to spend money to update our schools and other infrastructure. We went almost a year with an inoperable elevator in our courthouse. Our police department just recently was able to replace patrol cars with more than 100000 miles on them. These are the vehicles they rely on to respond to your 9-1-1 calls in a safe manner. We have lots of things to address the jail being only one of a long laundry list of infrastructure needs and capital projects that have been put on hold because of our current financial situation.  Ive researched this issue myself and am encouraged by a couple of things. The Virginia Sheriffs Association is lobbying to restore 50% funding to localities seeking to build new jails. Should that happen I think we are just a few years away from being able to afford building a 200-250 bed jail. Yes this would mean housing a percentage of our jail population elsewhere but it is my hope we can come to an agreement with the regional jail authority and contract with them for a specified number of beds. Obviously this will come at an increased cost but it is my hope those costs can be covered with increased sales and entertainment tax revenues and not as an additional property tax burden to our residents. Some of those costs will be covered by the State and the benefit is we keep control of our jail save jobs and retain control of the programs we can provide to the jail population. With proper planning I would hope we could design a facility that could be upgraded as monies become available eventually negating the need to house prisoners elsewhere giving us better control over expenses. Ive also identified some limited opportunities for grant funding that could possibly be used to make some needed upgrades to the current jail without running afoul of the DOC giving us the time we need to better research plan and prepare for the future. We need time to build a capital improvement account to fund at least a portion of the cost of a new jail. If this comes to fruition and we can reduce the current population at the city jail to a manageable level we increase the safety of both the inmates and our deputies. We gain the ability to make some much needed repairs that currently cannot be done safely. We may lose some positions at the Sheriffs Office but I believe those can be eliminated though attrition rather than by having to lay-off employees. We can also begin to re-establish services to the inmates that have had to be curtailed due to the current jail population.  I do not think building on the current site is viable option for lots of different reasons. Unfortunately that means moving the jail elsewhere in the City. I like my opponent intend to look at this option further but based on my conversations with both former Sheriff Maples and former Sheriff Weisenburger this seems to be a cost-prohibitive option with lots of complications.  Why am I so adamant about maintaining a jail here in the City? If the jail goes away completely approximately 50 employees will be laid off. Some of those may be absorbed by the regional jail but there is no guarantee as to the number nor is there any agreement regarding seniority transferring. There are several employees who have stayed through all this uncertainty and they deserve to know what their future will look like. Some of them are within a few years of securing their retirement.  From a public safety aspect I do not like the long transport times approximately 30 minutes one way to the regional jail. Currently if an officer is at our jail and his shift mates need help he can leave and be about anywhere in the city within five minutes. If something really bad happens the police department can call on the deputies to come help. They also help with special events such as Rhythm and Roots. When that staff is laid off the burden of staffing those events will fall solely on an already over-burdened police force. Yes we can add additional officers but at what cost? How many would we need to maintain our current level of service? Sheriffs Office employees salaries are covered by the State Compensation Board police officer salaries come out of the general fund which comes from taxes paid by those who live and shop in the City. There is no cost savings in eliminating the jail if we must increase the expenditure of tax dollars to continue to keep our community safe and insure calls for service are answered in a timely manner. Im not convinced these issues have been adequately addressed in this plan to move to the regional jail.  With a jail located in the City and staffed by BVSO employees we control the programs provided to the inmates. Their families are better able to come visit them. Our police officers are better able to gain access for interviews. We eliminate concerns with transport times and issues with driving a combative arrestee to the regional jail. We keep a pool of additional law enforcement personnel available to handle both special events and crisis situations.  Im a big proponent of working with the inmates to lower recidivism rates finding alternatives to incarceration for those charged with non-violent crimes and working in other ways to lower the daily jail population without sacrificing public safety. My opponent and I both have experience with drug court. This is one way we currently work to keep people out of jail. This program has had it successes and is one we should be proud of. I would work with our courts to insure this program remains viable to try and increase the number of participants and to provide those participants with the resources they need to successfully complete the program.  One of the biggest issues facing not just law enforcement but society as whole is how to best serve our mentally ill. We have very few mental health hospital beds. Officers often spend days guarding people who have been committed or worse yet because they have little other choice they end up jailing them for public nuisance offenses such as trespassing or public intoxication. Jailing these people is a short-term answer not a solution to a long-term problem. We need to fix our mental health system and provide a way for these people to be treated without treating them as criminals and incarcerating them. There are numerous studies that show the cost of treatment is at the very least comparable to the cost of incarceration and in many cases is lower. I heard Glenn Youngkin speak on this topic the other night and was encouraged by his promise to work on a fix should he be elected. While I do not have specific numbers I would dare say based on both personal experience and the numerous studies that have been conducted across the country that a large portion of our jail population would be better able to return to being a productive member of society if they were able to receive proper mental health care rather than a jail sentence.  Do not mistake compassion and empathy for an attitude of being soft on crime. There are also people in our jails who have proven time and again they have no respect for our society and its laws. They are predators pure and simple and our community is safer when they are incarcerated. As Sheriff I would do everything in my power to help identify these offenders and insure they receive sentences equivalent to their crime. One of the strategies that has a proven track record of reducing crime rates especially violent crime is to identify these persistent offenders and work with the courts to keep them off the streets. This was one of my responsibilities during the time I was administrator of our Project Safe Neighborhoods grant and something I have continued to work on since. We have been able to take some very violent career criminals off the streets using this strategy and it is something I would work on with our police and prosecutors if elected.  While our jail situation has hampered efforts to serve a large number of outstanding arrest warrants and capiases it is my belief people should be held accountable for their crimes. I am hopeful that as Sheriff I can work with my staff the courts the Commonwealth Attorneys Office and our police department to find a way to serve these that does not add to the urgency of our jail situation.  In talking with the current staff one of the major issues in recruiting and retaining staff is their current work schedule. Because the jail must be staffed 24/7/365 scheduling options are limited. We cannot simply close it on the weekends and let the inmates fend for themselves. For the staff under their current work schedule this means newer employees end up with fixed days off. This usually means they have to take vacation time to have a weekend off to attend a kids ball game or take a trip to Dollywood. This coupled with the uncertainty surrounding the jail has resulted in numerous vacancies within the office. I believe a rotating days off schedule is a viable option and would be one of the first things I would address upon taking office.  Outside of that it would be my intention to meet with the current staff both collectively and individually to get their input on what they see as the issues facing the jail as well as their ideas on addressing them. I began this process several months ago and I have received some great suggestions from them but feel the process would be even more productive as Sheriff rather than as a candidate.  It would be foolish to rush in and begin changing things without first getting an idea of the processes already in place how well they work and what changes could be implemented to increase safety and efficiency without creating additional issues or work. Having training in the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) having dealt with personnel issues for the better part of my career and having leadership and managerial experience I have great appreciation for how changing things simply for the sake of change can create issues.  I do appreciate the value of training and developing personnel and it is my intention to provide some of that training to the current staff. One of the things I did when Sheriff Maples first took office was provide active shooter training to a good portion of his staff especially those working in the courthouse. Should an incident occur at the courthouse the staff there as well as personnel working at the jail would be the first to confront the situation. This training was conducted for a very minimal cost and could be repeated for the entire staff. Dealing with the mentally ill is another area I identified as a training need at my current department and fortunately there are several organizations in our community that can provide this training to the staff at no cost. Due to my extensive experience in law enforcement developing lesson plans and conducting training on a wide variety of topics I think there are many similar opportunities to provide career development opportunities to the staff. I believe much of this can be done in-house without increasing training or personnel costs. This would be something I would begin working on day one. Lack of relevant training is also one of the issues brought up by many of the current employees.  On Monday I said Im not seeking an office or a title Im seeking a job. I wish I could take credit for that sentiment but it actually came from Glenn Youngkin. It resonated with me and does a great job of explaining why I am running. My parents instilled a hardy work-ethic in me. I started mowing yards when I was 11 years old and the only time I have been without some form of income producing job since was the two years I attended Tri Cities State Tech. It was their insistence I concentrate on my education but I had a job within a week of graduating and I have not been without one since. For the last 15 years I have been a salaried employee but that has not stopped me from working 60 hour weeks when the need was there to do so. I relish a challenge and this job will most likely be nothing but challenges at least initially and most definitely until we resolve the jail issue. I see the job of Sheriff much as I see my current job; someone who works for the citizens with the goal of making our community as safe as possible while protecting the interests of everyone. Personnel are our biggest asset and when they are well-trained confident in their job and respected they do their jobs more efficiently and effectively and they stay for longer periods of time. One of the basic tenets of leadership is employees leave bosses not jobs. I intend to be an approachable boss who is willing to listen and at least explore ideas and suggestions from both employees and the public. When an office holder is responsive and transparent they gain both public trust and support. That does not mean they always hear the answer they are seeking but they do get an answer.  Ive refrained from making many promises during this campaign. It would be unwise to do so until I have a better grasp of a complex job with many moving parts. The one thing I have promised and the promise I make to you the voters here I will give maximum effort and I wont quit until the task at hand has been completed. This is not about fulfilling some career goal attaining a title or cushioning my retirement. If that were the case I would have applied to be Chief of Police or Major at my current department. I passed despite having the qualifications to be competitive for both to concentrate on this campaign and to assure the voters I mean it when I say I want to be Sheriff.

Delco & Philly (PA-5) are projected to receive $20.8M in funding in the $547 billion INVEST in America Act. Nearly 15% is earmarked for bike lanes. The rest will go to expand several SEPTA stations and improve safety at rail and pedestrian crossings.  Is this what a century-defining transformation of infrastructure looks like? Is it fixing our roads and bridges that need it most? Building new highways? Funding projects worth the cost because we are sure they will have generational impacts on our infrastructure and economy? Not in Delco or Philly.  Yes we must fix our roads bridges and enhance the safety of our systems of transport. But Congress is talking about spending north of $1 trillion total over the coming months. If that's the case we need more than what we are slated to get.  Let's invest in infrastructure we need that is business-friendly will spur follow-on private investment remain self-sustaining and generate good-paying opportunities for working Americans. We must invest in things we know will benefit those of us footing the bill. We must settle for nothing less.,political,Facebook
Newton Needs Common Sense Leadership!  We residents have waited patiently hoping you would lead us in the right direction.  Our schools are slipping our police and fire demoralized crime is on the raise. Water bills are out of control city infrastructure is crumbling and bias is rampant in Newton City Government.  Where is our city council leadership - they are supposed to be the voters voice!  The reopening of our schools after covid was an utter disgrace; every other community around us did a better job than Newton - we failed our kids!  Newton once had the highest ranked schools in the state; where are we now?  Newton was once ranked the safest cities in America; now we cant even be found on the list. We are rapidly slipping becoming unsafe.  Our police department is demoralized; what city leader stood strongly beside our police when they were attacked by a Defund the Police mob right next to the police station?  Former Newton Police Chief Howard Mintz emailed the city council on 2/4/2021 saying The following is one of the reasons why the relationship between the police department and the city council is strained regarding Ward 5 City Councilor Bill Humphreys posts: ACAB 1312  All Cops Are Bastards. What has the Current City Council Leadership done about it?  Ask any Newton Police Officer: who in the city leadership has stepped in to support them as they were being vilified?  We ask our Newton Firefighters to run into burning buildings to save our families when we need help; ask them who in leadership has their back?  Roads and infrastructure just take a drive around the city. Its bad really bad. Why cant we do a better job instead of just band aids?  Our Water Bills are out of control; why cant we get accurate readings for our water usage anymore?  Why is Newton leaking and wasting more water than all the communities arounds us? The go-to excuse that our infrastructure is old - doesnt fly. Every community around us has aging infrastructure; Newton should not be the worst Newton should be leading the way on this issue. Invest now to protect the environment save our most precious natural resource: Water.  All claim to be for diversity and inclusion; yet this past week there were more offensive comments and actions at city hall. With the opportunity to lead and address intolerance at Newton City Hall there should have been outrage from all our leaders (not just Brenda Noel) instead they sat silent  their silence is being complicit.  City Council leadership have done too little too late for too long.  Our fellow good citizens throughout the city must say: this will NOT be tolerated anymore   it is time all of Newton stands up and says: no more!  Our community when we come together we matter. We make a difference. We need you to DO YOUR PART Click here to see who to vote to bring common sense back to Newton City Hall: SAVENONANTUM.COM Our Candidates Our Candidates,political,Facebook
This legislative session has officially wrapped which means the bills designed to derail Grain Belt Express have failed once again. Grain Belt Express will be a huge investment in our regions infrastructure and it will provide our regions communities with millions in tax revenues alone. The benefits of the project and the need for reliable power here in Missouri are just a couple of the reasons the bipartisan Missouri Public Service Commission unanimously approved the project and designated it as a public utility.,political,Facebook
"CAPITAL GAINS TAX HIKE  There is much conversation in regards to President Biden's proposed capital gains tax increase. The standard arguments are troped out against the tax hike: it will hurt investment interest rates will rise some guy won't be able to buy a yacht.  A tax rise is not necessary to fund Biden's infrastructure-plus proposals but because people practically have a heart attack whenever the federal deficit is brought up it would probably be wise to close the deficit with a higher long term capital gains tax in order to save people the heartache. But there are other reasons as well.  Currently assets sold after holding that asset for more than a year are taxed at highly favorable long term capital gains tax rates of between 0% and 20% depending on the tax bracket; while assets sold within a year of purchase are taxed at generally higher ordinary income tax rates. The long term favorable rate is to encourage investors to make long term investments rather than to engage in short term speculative trading which arguably has less if any social value. Biden proposes raising the long term rate to 39.6 percent which when combined with the current 3.8% investment surtax on high income investors would create a long term federal capital gains tax of 43.4% on high income investors.  As talked about often on this Page taxes and borrowing are not necessary to fund Federal spending. The U.S. with its own currency can create as much money as it would like it is not dependent on funding sources. Taxation and borrowing are necessary however to take money out of the economy in order to control inflation in the goods services and asset markets; taxation and borrowing are also effective tools for interest rate targeting; also Treasury securities are useful for investment portfolio stability; and taxation is useful to direct capital into socially useful purposes and for wealth distribution purposes.  The effect of the long term capital gain tax increase would be several fold and we will touch upon a couple likely impacts. ""According to the Tax Policy Center the top 1% of households report 75% of long-term capital gains."" (Wall Street Journal April 24 2021). If this report is correct then the tax rise is likely to fall mostly on the top 1%. It is difficult to see how this would be a problem. The top 1% are fabulously wealthy and a tax increase would likely not crimp their consumption patterns. In other words the tax will come out of asset holdings and this is good for a couple reasons. The sale of assets in order to pay the tax should deflate what many argue are inflated asset markets. Less money chasing these assets will deflate overvalued asset prices. This is a good thing. Also the wealthy who pay this tax will consequently be less wealthy and this will beneficially reduce the wealth gap which tears at the Nation's social fabric. That's two good things to come from raising the tax. If by chance the higher tax crimps consumption spending among the wealthy a third good thing would happen: less consumption. The well-off consume too much. This is damaging both to the environment and as stated undermines communal values.  To the extent that the higher capital gains tax filters down to those beneath the top 1% the same arguments can be made only in different proportions as consumption takes on a larger proportion of the consumption-investment mix. There are many good reasons to increase the long term capital gains tax. There are also counter arguments.  The first being that the higher tax will discourage asset sales which will lead to an inefficient allocation of resources. On the other hand the slower turnover of assets would reduce the dynamism in the U.S. economy which leaves many workers often gasping for breath in the rapidly changing job market. The follow-up argument is the depletion of private capital will cause interest rates to rise; this is a difficult argument to make as the Federal Reserve (FED) since the Financial crisis has demonstrated an ability to successfully target interest rates from short to long term rates across the yield curve. Another argument is that higher taxes on the wealthy will create a shortage of private capital for investment. This is similar to the interest rate argument but is somewhat different and there are two aspects to it. There are two types of capital: debt and equity capital--equity being the at-risk capital that owners put-up when they invest in a business.  To the extent that money is borrowed or debt created or derived from the commercial banking sector the argument that higher capital gains tax rates will reduce the availability of debt capital is nonsense. If banks see good lending opportunities the loans will be made. Commercial banks create new money when they lend and this new money creation is limited only by a typical 10% reserve requirement. If banks were to find themselves short of reserves a near impossibility given the current environment in which banks are awash in excess reserves the FED will willingly provide the necessary reserves in order to protect the payments system. In terms of shrinking the pool of equity capital there is likely merit to this argument. But as stated earlier with asset markets likely inflated anything which absorbs excessive liquidity out these markets is a good thing.  In the end the capital gains tax increase represents a transfer of resources from the private sector where much investment is channeled into obnoxious and environmentally damaging consumption production to the public sector for long overdue physical and human capital infrastructure development which in the long term will support the private sector.  While there may be elements of the tax which require scrutiny generally the tax represents an advance forward for a nation which has suffered broad public disinvestment in order to serve the short term profit desires of the private sector during the past 40 years of neoliberal nonsense.",political,Facebook

VOTE Tuesday November 02!  Re-Elect Knut Sauer  I am running for Re-Election as Councilman in the Town of Jay. I have brought high energy dedication hands on approach and a drive for transparency and accountability to the council. During my 2 years on the council I have dedicated a lot of time and energy on educating myself through research attending webinars & trainings and reading many publications. There is a lot to learn and being a productive council member requires dedication commitment hands-on approach and a significant time investment. I have also had the opportunity to gain an understanding of the inner workings of the town both the positives and the challenges and networking with our elected State representatives.  I am committed dedicated and ready to take on another term as your town councilman. With the experience I have gained the past 2 years I will be able to be very productive and focus on moving the Town of Jay forward providing continuity on the board and support to the new incoming Supervisor.  For the past 26 years I have worked as an international sales and marketing manager. My strong financial & budget acumen and planning & project management experience brings critical skills to the town council. I serve as Vice President of the AuSable Acres Property Owners Association founding member of the Au Sable River Valley Business Association very active volunteer with the local Rotary Club North Country SPCA ORDA/Mt. Van Hoevenberg and with NYSEF.  During the 2021 budget process I was adamant we stop the annual property tax increase and our town wide general budget was slightly decreased after years of increases. We recently adopted our 2022 budget which yielded a net decrease in overall taxes while shifting funding to highway. At the same time we have been able to invest in critical highway equipment and our highway department has done a lot more maintenance and upkeep of equipment replacing both roofs on highway garage. As your councilman I am strongly advocating for better long-term planning including an infrastructure improvement and a capital equipment maintenance & replacement plan and more responsible fiscal management. Being a very hands-on active member on the parks committee with volunteer help we have done general upkeep at Douglas Memorial Park secured a grant for and planted a pollinator garden completed major upkeep by resetting the fence and rebuilt the garden beds at the Community Garden. We currently are in the process of upgrading our Childrens Park Playground having secured grants and donations to cover the cost of play equipment and a covered open-air structure. We are in the process of considering a Smart Growth grant which will serve as a master plan for our parks recreational and other quality of life initiatives as part of a larger strategic plan we hopefully will embark on. EV charges are another initiative in progress with grants through NYSERDA while also working on other energy efficiency initiatives which ultimately will reduce utility costs. Our town planning board used to be comprised of the town council members. We now have an independent planning board comprised of great community volunteers who are able dedicate the required time and effort acquire the expertise needed and at the same time free up the town council to focus their efforts on the many other town needs and challenges requiring attention. I have spent significant time researching grants and grants opportunities and identified a grant which has been applied for that if approved would cover 50% of a proposed Flood Wall in Au Sable Forks which would help protect our main street and business there from flooding. I am networking with our elected State officials we can no longer stay silent!  We have made good progress during my first 2 years on the board and the wheels are in motion but we have a lot of catching up to do to turn the economic tide in the Town of Jay and it will take a lot of hard work dedication teamwork and community involvement to achieve our joint goals. We must welcome more community involvement and re-activate the Jay Task Force initiate a comprehensive planning process and develop a Vision for Jay that capitalizes on all the great things our town and community has to offer. We must aggressively pursue grants and other non-property tax revenue and explore options and ideas to broaden our tax base and not just increase or property taxes to keep up with costs. We must bring new business to our town capitalize on the growing tourism in the region support and encourage potential investors and make Jay a place to stop not just a town to pass through. At the same time we must find a good balance for our full-time residents and provide affordable housing capitalizing on our towns ideal location between Lake Placid and Plattsburgh while preserving our slower-paced friendly atmosphere and beautiful natural setting.  Together we can achieve our common goals and see the Town of Jay prosper long into the future. There is a change of attitude optimism is back and the wheels are in motion keep them rolling and Re-Elect Knut Sauer.  Thank you for your vote and your support!,political,Facebook
Many of you have mentioned receiving an email from the Southern Utah Citizens for Ethical Government. There are passionate individuals on both sides of this race. I appreciate passionate support about ideas but I absolutely condemn negativity like this and you won't see it from my campaign.  I know many are not happy with the current administration and I get it. If I was happy with the way things are I wouldn't be in this race. Campaigns are tough. In my mind when it comes to campaigns ideas and issues are fair game and that's where you'll see my focus and where it has been.  I'm running on a platform of new ideas and I hope that has been clear throughout this campaign. We need to look at the best use of the billion gallons of wastewater we pour on the ground each year. We need to look at private non-tax funding sources for recreation. We need to prioritize needed infrastructure over ribbon cuttings in our annual budget.  I know change is hard but we need to make that change for a healthier city. If you think some opportunities have passed us by in the last 8 years then vote for Garth Green for fresh ideas and leadership.  I've enjoyed the opportunities of the last few months to talk about my plans for the city and I look forward to finishing this campaign talking about ways to make Cedar City even better.,political,Facebook
We have uploaded our fifth episode discussing the headlines of the week and Biden's Infrastructure Plan!  www.politicalchitchat.com/podcast-episodes/episode-5-the-biden-infrastructure-plan,political,Facebook
"On Tuesday October 5th 2021 Navarro County took a tragic hit to its infrastructure. The footprints of Chief Paul Henley are everywhere in this county. The City of Corsicana hired him to be the Fire Chief for Corsicana but as we have all witnessed he didnt stop there. He embraced this community and committed his entire being to be a part of this entire city community and county. His first year of service here was spent away from his wife and son. He put this community on a pedestal and devoted every bit of his attention and energy towards Corsicana Fire. He bridged the gap between volunteer departments and City fire. He took on everything asked of him plus more. He devoted time and energy to help assist Eric Myers on the emergency management side. He stepped in and devoted time to the United Way Boys & Girls Club along with numerous other things.  He has done all these things with a smile on his face an electric personality that you almost questioned if it was real. That is till you get to know him then you understand it is a 100 percent him. The energy Chief Henley brings with him is contagious. His knowledge is staggering to say the least. The leadership skills he possesses are truly astonishing. He has made us better by seeing listening and learning from him. Chief has had a huge impact on our personal lives including giving expecting families a personalized infant rocking chair to sending birthday cards to our children on their special day. He knows everyones name along with their spouse and children. To some this might not mean much but to us this meant everything.  As we watch Chief Henley start packing his office it has saddened many. It has made some question whether they want to continue to be here. Its leaving a lot of uncertainty. We wonder if all the constant roadblocks hes endured will only be increased and multiply. Its no secret Chief Henley is choosing to leave because he feels he has done as much as he can and with all the constraints he has now become ineffective. The day he walked in the door he said guys Im here to stay as long as I can make a difference the day I feel I cannot do that will be the day I need to leave and move on. It has never been about the money as we know. He took a large pay cut from his previous job to come here.  Recently he and his wife built a beautiful home in Navarro County. Is that something you do if you plan on leaving because this is just a steppingstone to a bigger dept? Over the last two years we have watched SAFER grants fall to the wayside by micromanaged antics to disqualify candidates. We have consistently produced data with numbers to show the City Manager and council why it is important to staff 3 personnel per Engine. Chief Henley spent a lot of time gathering info and showing exactly why safety was important and what number of personal he would need to accomplish what it took to serve this community for it all to be thrown by the wayside to settle on a number the council and city manager thought was efficient enough. To discount the chiefs opinions and concerns and just go with what they thought was good is not safe nor smart in our opinion. Chief never expected to get everything he asked for. He did however believe by producing data and showing the hows whys whats whens and where's that he was telling the whole story and it was a no brainer that any city leadership would want to protect their citizens from the best of their abilities not to mention the firemen protecting the citizens.  As we continue to reflect on all the great experiences weve had with Chief Henley we cant help to wonder why an amazing leader like Chief Henley will have to go elsewhere to feel like he can make a difference again. Its time for change citizens of Corsicana and Navarro County. Its time some leaders step down. The odds of getting anyone close to the magnitude of our current chief is questionable but we can only hope and pray we can find someone close. When that time comes do we want to end up with the same results?  ""We cannot solve our problems with the same level of thinking that created them."" Albert Einstein  We all love you Chief and hope the best for you and your family along with your new brothers and sisters that we know you will make a difference for!

Why am I running? It is my belief that our elected officials in El Paso TX rarely if ever are held accountable for their decisions. They make decisions and essentially act like many of our parents would when we were younger. Its whats best for you because we said so. Problem is they are not our parents. Its quite simple these roles should be reversed. When decisions are made they should feel obligated to explain who what when where why how. Instead they distract with half truths and act as though we should be grateful. Heres a recent example. Just recently County Judge Samaniego and his Commissioners Court boasted proudly about how in the best interest of the people they were not gonna give themselves raises (very nobel of them) and they will not raise property taxes both because El Pasoans are struggling due to the pandemic. These are good decisions. But WHAT IS THE TRUTH? The truth is that even contemplating giving themselves a raise is absurd. As it is they already make at least double the average income of El Paso residents. Thats just on average. About 30% make $30000 or less. Almost 40% make $60000 or more (and by more I mean 18% is AT LEAST $100000). But they did us a favor. But they cut property taxes because of the struggling residents of El Paso County. Sounds good and it is. But WHATS THE TRUTH? Since this county administration was elected less than 4 years ago the tax rate has gone up. Now when a state has no state tax yeah taxes will be higher. They inherited a tax at approx .44. The next year (2020) they jumped it up to .48. Now in 2021 they do everyone the favor of not raising the tax. I may be mistaken but from the info I can find property values are looking to go up as well. So how much are people actually saving? If Im wrong Im open to being educated. But I dont believe Im the only one who sees this and feels this way. Which is part of the problem. They should feel obligated to explain these things in detail to their constituents. Thats not the case though. They pat themselves on the back publicly about doing us a favor. First off not much of a favor. Secondly even if it was/is its their job. No credit for doing what your supposed to do. Especially when its the bare minimum at best. Again if Im misguided or wrong in my research bring it to my attention and I will own it. The income they are acquiring is being poorly mismanaged. Part of the commissioners jobs are supposed to be taking care of infrastructure roads buildings. Ill stick with roads. How many projects do we have going on all over town? At the same time? They make decisions and then immediately have to change it because it was not planned out properly. I can think of multiple areas that have been terrible for multiples of years. Railroad the neighborhood streets between Hondo Pass and Hercules Doniphan and countless others. Having to build additions to the freeway after just adding to the freeways because they are reactive and not proactive. How long is trans mountain gonna continue to be a single lane? I know the rain and flooding really put a strain on much of these road problems. Im sure that was a problem that they were supposed to have at least partially fixed. I guess they didnt expect a 50 year storm 14 years after the last 50 year storm. What happened to 14 years of taxes and water works hikes? Reactive not proactive. But absolutely unacceptable. I know it doesnt all fall in this current administration but its a problem that seems to be happening no matter who is sitting in those seats. Thats one of many reasons we need to change their comfort and processes. But why fix our problems here at home. Keep spending the money fighting the state over and over and over. Much more proactive. -Adam Fatuch,political,Facebook
When I ran for the Burgess ( Mayor) of Woodsboro which is the office I currently hold I said transparency is something I promised would happen while I was in office. Here is an update for the town of Woodsboro from the September meeting. The grants that I applied for from the Maryland Department of Natural Resources Playground Infrastructure Grant to build a stage/bandshell in the eastern part of the park and to replace the small walking bridge to be replaced with an ADA compliant bridge were approved. The town will be receiving $60304.00 dollars for the stage to be built and landscaping and $18075.00 for the bridge to be built. The contractors have already begun work on the stage. The new bridge will be built in early spring. It was also announced that the town will be receiving the first half of their American Rescue Plan Recovery Funds that was issued by the President and approved by Congress. Initially the town was supposed to receive $767512 dollars which is 75% of the annual budget which is the maximum that a municipality can receive. With the budget amendment of 2019 with the roads that where repaired Burgess Barnes submitted an amendment with the updated budget and it was approved so now the adjusted amount of funds that the town will be receiving is $947817.00 dollars instead. The first half of $473908.50 will be disbursed to the town the week of 9/21/2021 and the remaining half in May of 2022. These funds have very strict guidelines on what they can be used for however water and sewer is one of the options and what the town is need so a large portion will be used toward that. The council will be discussing this at the October 12th 2021 meeting and as always residents and members of the public are always welcome to attend our open meetings. I would like to see a portion of the funds go to help local businesses that were hit hard by the pandemic. More details will be coming on this over the next month. Town Clerk Mary Rice and I met with the architect in late August concerning the new town office that will be built on Main Street. The meeting was very productive and the architect assured us that he would have the final plans by the end of September. The goal is to have approval to start taking bids on the building by the end of October and hopefully to have groundbreaking by the end of the year. It was also announced that Burgess Barnes has reached out to State Delegate Jesse Pippy (who also came out in July and toured the town and site where the new building will go) and State Senator Michael Hough regarding a proposal to have funding possibly placed in the Governors upcoming budget or a possible grant for funding. If this can get approved it would be very beneficial to the town regarding the amount of funds that the town would have to borrow to build the office building. I feel very confident that Delegate Pippy and Senator Hough will work hard to get this on the budget. I am working on getting a proposal to them this week.,political,Facebook
MODERN MONETARY THEORY: MISREPRESENTED ONCE AGAIN  Recently on a Bloomberg financial podcast a senior executive at J.P. Morgan stated he did not believe in Modern Monetary Theory (MMT). MMT is a controversial monetary theory which offers a description of monetary operations which challenge orthodox economic and financial thinking. Within current MMT reasoning there is a belief there is room for fiscal expansion which when coordinated with the Nation's central bank--the Federal Reserve (FED) will enable public investment in human and physical capital i.e. infrastructure without inflationary consequences. The J.P. Morgan executive argued that in order for MMT to succeed that it would also have to fail: that to accumulate the debt which he implies is acceptable to MMT for public investment then even if the investment proved good for the economy the accumulated debt would then tank the economy.  It was the strangest comment that one could expect from an investment banker and it also misrepresented MMT views. First from an investment banker perspective it is strange to state that debt issuance condemns an institution to failure. Bankers afterall are peddlers of private sector debt issued on the belief that the gains from private investment will generally exceed the cost of capital. Government debt issued in order to facilitate productive investment: physical and human likewise has the potential to create long term gains in the economy which exceed the cost of capital. So it was strange to hear an investment banker ignore the growth potential associated with public debt issuance which finances physical and human capital investment: the type of investment promoted within the MMT framework.  The MMT public sector investment portfolio would include such things as green energy investment in education and most importantly a federal job guarantee program which would offer a job to anyone who seeks a job at a livable wage with health and child care benefits--a near full employment program.  A legitimate concern here should not be the level of debt so long as the associated funds are directed into productive investment but the concern should be the potential inflationary impact of large scale investment which creates individual earnings not yet matched by an increase in the provision of consumer goods and services. The temporary mismatch between increased earnings from new investment and the availability of goods and services may create short to medium term inflationary pressures in these consumer markets. One market concern undoubtedly is the belief that once inflation begins it feeds on itself into an upward spiral of increased inflationary pressure which can only be resolved through monetary and fiscal tightenings i.e. an induced recession.  It is not clear to me whether MMT has adequately addressed the short term inflationary impact of broad public infrastructure investment. MMT definitely recognizes that Federal spending is limited by potential inflationary effects of Federal spending and it seems they differ from the broader market participants in their view of the size and scope of available resources which can be put to work before real resource restraints create inflationary pressure. In other words it seems that MMT believes there currently exists greater slack in the economy than the broader market participants believe and it also seems that MMT believes that increased productive capacity which meets consumer demand can come online rather quickly in order to thwart these inflationary pressures. The latter view is undoubtedly challenged in a trade restricted environment.  It appears that MMT takes the long view and the bigger point is that green energy will eventually be a more efficient source of energy while high tech education combined with liberal arts training will make us both more productive and better citizens. The federal jobs programs will assist in the development of work skills which will further enhance national productivity. Debt used to finance such activity would be a very good use of debt and will not inflict damage on the national economy but rather will enhance long term growth in a noninflationary manner.  Much of the above discussion is premised on a misrepresentation of the MMT view on public debt. The J.P. Morgan Executive's view is premised on the idea that Federal deficit spending must be funded with debt. This is not the MMT view. Federal debt issuance is a policy option not a requirement for deficit spending.  The MMT view is that a sovereign monetary authority such as the U.S. which creates its own free floating currency creates money when it spends and destroys money through taxation and borrowing. Money creation and money destruction need not be equal. Spending need not be fully funded but only 'funded' to an extent and in a manner which prevents inflation in the goods services and asset markets. In other words deficit spending need not be funded with debt: the money for deficit spending is created through the act of spending. An equivalent debt issuance merely destroys an equal amount of money thereby neutralizing any inflationary impact of the deficit spending. Debt issuance i.e. money destruction is a mere tool for inflation control and for other convenient purposes i.e. private portfolio investment stability store of value interest rate targeting . . . .  Furthermore the Executive's narrative ignored debt management techniques discussed previously on this Page such as debt extinguishment the Platinum coin idea which grew out of the 2011 budget ceiling crisis taxation of the well-off rather than borrowing from the well-off and Federal Reserve perpetual holdings of Treasury debt on its balance sheet--which is costless to the U.S. taxpayer. The Executive's brief discussion of MMT was yet another false representation of MMT views.  Generally it is wise to dismiss about 85% of corporate reporting on MMT. Most commentators have not seriously examined MMT; others are in no mood to change the status quo. Large capital interests in the private sector simply do not want to concede additional space to the public sector regardless of the long term growth potential associated with public sector investment.  Undoubtedly the Nation's long term productivity potential would be greatly enhanced by the above public sector investments. But in the long run the current investment class won't be here. Perhaps this is part of the problem. The other part of the problem lies in the short term investment horizon of private sector firms a response to investor demands for short term profits which do not align with the long term investment objectives of the Federal government.,political,Facebook
Re-Elect Michael Blomquist Campaign Update #3  Smart Growth and Infrastructure in Harker Heights  Since I was elected over 1000 new citizens have moved into and call Harker Heights home! Additionally 498 new homes and 27 new businesses were built valued in excess of $187 million. Also during my tenure the City Council has funded 64 major infrastructure projects valued at $31.2 million including projects like Verna Lee Blvd which included resurfacing and sidewalk construction. Keeping our City highly desirable keeps Harker Heights growing as we attract new businesses and households. In order to keep Harker Heights The Bright Star of Central Texas for current and future citizens we will apply Smart Growth principles to build up City services to meet the growing demands.

First of all let me start by saying I am against the 1 trillion dollar infrastructure deal. (BLUF It should be part of the normal budget process). They are claiming this will be budget neutral because they are using money already put aside that has not been used. First of all that is not budget neutral that money would have went back into the general fund or could have been used to lower our debt you are still adding 1 trillion in expenses without offsetting it with revenues. We are already at a tipping point when it comes to inflation this may push us over the edge. These programs should have gone through the normal appropriation process rather then an additional spending bill.  Secondly if you are going to spend 1 trillion in infrastructure of which only 11% is for roads and bridges how can you not have 5 billion to secure our southern border? Do not get me wrong I am pro-immigration I think we need to have Ellis Island type of immigration with the cravat that the US Government is not financially responsible to care for them. Truth is right now we can use people who want to work. We have businesses shutting down due to lack of labor. That said we still need to close off the routes smugglers use both for contraband and people who would not be able to pass a security screening. It does need to be controlled/managed. (Sorry to my open border friends that is just not feasible).  This is a win-win. The right wants the border secure and illegal immigration halted (as well as welfare being used for immigrants halted) and the left wants a more flexible immigration policy. Why is this so hard? Oh yea because it excites their bases come election time. You can not fix what you do not want to fix.  I would say return common sense to DC but at this point I am not sure it was ever there.

Wasting our time and resources for personal agendas Using council meetings for grandstanding debating and political campaign speeches.  What we need in Waterloo is discussions about progress. Community. Shared solutions. And build on our common interests to provide basic services as civil managers. -Safety and security. -Infrastructure. -Growth and prosperity for all of our citizens. Its time to get back to the basics. Common sense solid solutions for Waterloo. Balancing our budget and securing public services. Attracting tourism and growing business for entrepreneurs. Creating entertainment for friends and family to enjoy. Thats who we are. Thats the spirit of Waterloo.  Time better spent. What could we have been discussing at city council meeting or out learning from citizens instead.? -Ward 5. Residents on Windsor dr would like to consider a speed bump To slow down cut- through traffic for kids safety. -Ward 3 main routes to the Allen hospital (Donald street and Broadway) are some of the last to get plowed -Ward 3 corner of Lucas and Hall street constantly flooding and back flowing through properties to the NW. -Ward 2 a high trafficked Sulentic Park has no restroom facilities. Neighboring residents are often asked to use their houses. -Ward 2 intersections of Mercedes bend and Sweet water where they have no curb and gutter they too have water flow issues. -Ward 3&1 the new crosswalk indicators are loud and annoying -At-Large discussing solutions for increased demand for special needs facilities. -the money spent on this logo issue could have been spent hiring an additional officer to actually reduce crime and repair the facilities inside the police station or help cover overtime.,political,Facebook
"2 Week until Election Day! ***PLEASE SHARE THIS***  ***PROPOSITIONS THAT ARE ON THIS YEARS BALLOT***  NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE VOTING FOR YOU MUST EDUCATE YOURSELVES ON THESE PROPOSITIONS.  This is a direct link to the NYS BOE's website that explains everything in detail. The are 3 CONSTITUTIONAL amendments that are on the ballot. (#1#3#4)   I will be voting NO on all 4 Proposition's and I will explain why below.  PROP. #1 Redistricting Amendment  This weakens the independent redistricting process enacted by Voters in 2014 before it's been allowed to work:  a) Designed to change the redistricting rules on the day the Independent Redistricting Commission must submit its plan to the legislature this year. b) Eliminates the safeguards built into the law that ensures BOTH PARTIES have an equal role at the Independent Redistricting Commission. c) Reduces the voting requirement from 66% to 60% which makes it easier for Democrats (who currently hold a super-majority) to OVERRULE the Independent Redistricting Commission. d) Creates a mechanism for the Democrats to circumvent the independent commission process by refusing to allow a vote on a redistricting plan which would give Democrats in the legislature a free hand to draw the maps.  PROP #2 Right to clean air clean water and a healthful environment.  ""Who doesn't believe in that???"" This bill is VAGUE and I believe intended to be vague. There is no specificity on how any of that is going to be accomplished. This is a BROAD bill that gives the State the ability to cite this ""law"" whenever they want to do something that they will ""claim"" will ""protect the environment"". For example ..... let's say they want to outlaw all gas and oil furnaces or outlaw all diesel vehicles .... they could use this ""law"" as their justification! Again no specificity no plan nothing just fill in the blank.  Before someone try's to pull a political spin on me and say that I'm ""not for the environment"" because I'm voting NO on this prop. Other than my explanation above I have been a vocal advocate for sewers all across Long Island especially in the low-lying areas. This infrastructure improvement will go a long way in cleaning up our water quality. Additionally I have PERSONALLY partook in beach clean-ups KIC clean-ups and clean-ups throughout various waterways during my lifetime. My personal residence EXCEEDS many GEO friendly and pollution reduction recommendations and I built it that way with the environment in mind!  PROP #3 Same day Voter Registration  Eliminates the requirement that citizens register to vote at least 10 days before an election.  a) Enables voter registration at the polling place where poll workers will be unable to properly verify proof of residency and eligibility to vote. b) Newly register voters will vote on the machines instead of affidavit ballots making it impossible to disqualify the votes of those later determined to be ineligible to vote. c) This is an invitation to voter fraud  PROP #4 No Excuse Absentee Voting  ""The legislature may by general law provide a manner in which and the time and place at which qualified voters may vote and for the return and canvass of their votes in any election.""  a) Eliminates the requirement for absentee voting that the voter will be absent from the county or unable to appear at the polling place because of illness or physical disability. b) This can lead to universal vote by mail and ballot harvesting.

From the Campaign of Prudence Wilkins:  As I've walked around the community introducing myself to the citizens of Spring Hope and having conversations about your concerns within our town it has been very informative and I hope we can continue this conversations where I'm your Town Commissioner or Mayor.  It's important that I do express what my capabilities are as a Mayor. As a Mayor I won't have a vote  unless it's to break a tie between our Commissioners. The Mayor does facilitate the monthly town meetings and is basically the face of the town. We all know it's important that we see growth and revitalization in our town without deviation from being Spring Hope. I'm a big believer in making our town more marketable I've been putting on events in Spring Hope for over 4 years which brought out different crowds to see the ambience we have in Spring Hope. We do have infrastructure needs which is being addressed with the help our house and state leaders. We still having on-going projects to address our sideways and street repairs . Getting our yoing adults involved in our town structure which is why I'm starting a youth council which was approved by the current leadership. I've had meetings with some of neighboring leadership that are a bit larger to gain some insight on market strategies for Spring Hope. Spring Hope is HOT SPOT for growth being centrally located in close proximity to major corridors such as Greenville and Raleigh. Our Senior Community is important as they are the staple of success for Spring Hope. I believe everyone is important and contribute to the success of this town no matter where you live how much money you make. Let's keep Spring Hope Strong and Unified.

I would like to officially announce my candidacy for re-election as an Alderman in the City of Florence. During my first four-year term we have worked to improve Florences road sewer and water infrastructure and we have striven to be good stewards of every taxpayer dollar. I have enjoyed working with the Board and the Mayor. While we havent always agreed on every topic we have always been respectful and appreciative of each others position. And our goal has stayed the same: do what is best for our citizens and our city.  Having lived in Florence since the mid-80s I can reflect on how our city has changed over the past nearly 40 years. I remember being in Ms. Eiland's 2nd-grade class in the newly built elementary school and drinking from the water hose before soccer practice down at the park. I remember it being a big deal in high school when Taco Bell and Dominos opened in the new gas station on 49. I remember the flashing light downtown after 11 at night. And I remember always having felt safe and happy in Florence. Whether youve lived here for 7 months or 70 years my goal is for everyone to feel the same way I do. As a member of the Board of Aldermen for the past four years we have worked together to improve our city amid the Highway 49 project and a pandemic all while keeping our city's safe small-town charm. On June 8 I humbly ask you to consider casting one of your five votes for me to continue working with the Board and Mayor in serving the people of the great City of Florence.,political,Facebook
Today the City of Denton in court has had their restraining order left intact against ERCOT for using what they call uplift. Uplift is a mechanism ERCOT uses to spread expenses to all members of ERCOT when other members fail to pay. This uplift cost is in addition to the $207 million price gouge gift we received already. DME and the citizens of Denton should not be punished repeatedly for being responsible operators and users on the ERCOT grid. The city has invested hundreds of millions of dollars for our energy infrastructure so what is the point when we still get taken to the cleaners. Its time to have more favorable terms with ERCOT or leave it and be independent of ERCOT like El Paso is.,political,Facebook

Jeff its about water.  Thats what I love about mayors - they always cut to the chase.  People tell you what they want. Mayors tell you what theyve *gotta* have.  We just finished eight town halls in counties east of I-95 and we heard a clear theme from the mayors who joined us: water sewer and broadband.  Yes roads yes bridges - but water sewer and broadband. Theyre overlooked because theyre underground but theyre crucial to creating so many other opportunities.  You can lump them together and call them subsurface infrastructure but its really about laying an economic foundation. And if youre missing one piece youre not going to build much on top of it.  Example: People talk about the lack of affordable rental options. Then the mayor says We cant build an apartment complex on a well and a septic tank. Gotta have water and sewer. Thats whats holding us back.  Then someone asks How can we keep young people from leaving? Before I can answer a mayor says Cant keep em here without broadband. Just not possible. Gotta have it.  These things are expensive and lots of our rural counties dont have the tax base to really build out water and sewer on their own. They need state and federal partners to do it.  But heres the thing: We spent $2 trillion in Afghanistan. And the vast majority of that was unnecessary.  If just 0.5% of those funds had found their way to the rural counties east of I-95 (or west of Asheville for that matter) youd have a brand new economic foundation across the entire region. Water sewer and broadband would be strong enough to support all kinds of business growth from entrepreneurs to major industries.  Youd be looking at a dramatic upgrade in the economy of the region. Lives would be much better and probably longer.  And thats roughly the amount that were slated to get as a state if the bipartisan infrastructure bill passes. But heres the thing: Its going to be spread across the whole state.  (Incidentally all three of our states GOP Senate candidates said they would have voted against it - because its too big of an investment.)  Bottom-line: If this infrastructure bill passes were going to be able to make large investments in our state. Thats a good thing and its going to mean a lot for a lot of people. But were still going to have major unmet infrastructure needs particularly in rural counties. Finding ways to help those counties invest in their economic foundations is going to remain a priority.  And that means mayors need to keep telling senators what they need and we need senators who will listen.  - Jeff Jackson,political,Facebook

I've previously talked about the four categories of your Newton City Bill. Since people seem to talk most about their water bill I will first address the water part of your Newton City Bill. It goes without saying that water is a precious resource and we should pay close attention on how much we use when we use it and for what we use it for. So let's dive right in! How do we measure usage and how are we charged for Water? Newton measures their water in cubic feet  not in gallons. There are 7.481 gallons per cubic feet of water. Newton water customers pay $ 17.65 for the first 200 Cubic feet They also pay $5.95 per 100 Cubic Foot for water used over the base of 200 Cubic Feet. So  your first 1496 gallons costs $ 17.65 Each 748 gallons over that base amount costs % 5.95 Its hard for a family to stay below the 200 cubic feet of water usage each month but when you go over that base 200 the price per Cubic feet declines. In reviewing various water usage customer accounts it was very clear no two households are the same. Comparing one bill to another is very difficult without digging into why bills are different. Large families that take quick showers dont use as much water as a retired couple that takes long showers. Lawn and garden water can make a difference  some people have wells they use to water grass and plants. We also need to remember what we are paying for in our water bill - its not just water. We also pay for water production (pumping/well maintenance/well power) treatment transmission distribution storage EPA and State regulation compliance replacement of meters maintenance water rights billing/collection and a slew of other things. Just imagine the cost of replacing each of 8500 water meters over a 20-year period. As a Newton Resident you have the right to expect to have water when you need it. You also have the right to expect the water to be of clean and drinkable. In order to do this  maintenance is required on all of the wells lines towers pump stations booster stations fire hydrants valves and other components of your water delivery system. Having the right water pressure and volume is also important  redundancy is also important so when maintenance is being performed at one location water can still be delivered in another. The City Budget  Water Department The Water Department has a $ 5.4 Million Budget $ 1342215 is allotted for equipment replacement and infrastructure projects The water tower project by Sand Creek on 1st street is likely the next project Sometime the City saves for 4-5 years to do a project like this Also included in the water are bond and interest payments on prior projects Since the Water Department is a business within a business they have the normal business expenses of Salaries equipment maintenance fuel supplies etc. The most debatable expenditure is likely the transfers for administrative cost sharing and property tax relief. These amount to $ 570000 for this past year. The debate is whether to attach the cost of transfers to property and include them in the mill levy  or to let water users that are tax exempt pay for their water bills since they pay no real estate taxes. If I have time in my research I will verify how the Newton City Mill Levy compares to the Mill levies of other communities with which we compete for economic development projects. Often times economic development prospects compare mill levy to mill levy in communities they are looking to expand into  even though the actual mill levy might not actually be a apples to apples comparison. But  they still likely look a one mill being higher in one community over that of another community and often times pick the lower number to concentrate on. And I have been told by multiple people that our actual mill levy when compared to other communities in our city peer group is the highest. So even though you might want your water bill to be lower keeping you mill levy is important too. I will try to talk about this more in the future. In conclusion after reviewing water costs and what the city charges for water the amount of money we pay specifically for water is fair in my estimation. I do not feel the water portion of our bill is the culprit.  Lance,political,Facebook
"Facts are important so it's tough to see people say that 'Maine doesn't benefit' from the Clean Energy Corridor. That's simply not true.  Apologies for the long post but the fact is: Maine benefits in quite a few ways starting with receiving some of the clean electricity that will come through the Corridor.  Last July Governor Mills negotiated with Hydro Quebec to buy some of that clean electricity for Maine too. It'll be enough to power 70000 homes or 10000 businesses and at a discounted rate. For example Massachusetts consumers will get this electricity for 6 cents per kilowatt-hour but Maine consumers will get it for 2.5 cents per kilowatt-hour.  Beyond that...  Towns that host a part of the corridor are expected receive increased tax revenue of $18 million. The City of Lewiston alone will get $7 million in new tax revenue the first year because of the substation. That's more than the Walmart distribution center added. Lewiston city officials are over the moon about it. One called it a ""life-saver for the city.""  Decreased co2 emissions will be the equivalent of 750000 fewer cars on the road in the region.  CMP is going to put another $200 million into upgrading Maine's electrical grid to make it more reliable and help it accept more renewables.  The project creates a $15 million fund to help Mainers install energy-efficient heat pumps.  With more stable energy supply coming into the grid Mainers will see fewer spikes in seasonal rates.  The project will invest $15 million in rural broadband internet access for Western Maine plus providing some of the infrastructure to allow the fiber-optic cable to be run.  Maine snowmobilers will get another 50 miles of straightaways and wood mats used during construction will be donated to snowmobile clubs to be used as bridges.  The project will invest $15 million to help Maine expand its infrastructure for electric vehicles. More places to plug in.  The project will proactively invest $140 million in lowering CMP customers' energy bills. Plus $50 million in rate-relief specifically for low-income consumers.  The project is giving the state $6 million in funding for a variety of educational purposes.  The project is investing $6 million in Maine's land-conservation fund which is run by the Nature Conservancy. Plus the 40000 acres that the project will preserve on its own.  The new electricity that comes through will lower rates for Maine consumers to a combined tune of somewhere between $14 million and $44 million a year.  Seven small timber mills from Maine were awarded $20 million in contracts to make mats... which is great from the logging industry in that part of the state.  The Passamaquoddy Tribe will receive $2.5 million in benefits.  The project will invest $10.5 million in economic development and tourism for Maine.  Plus of course the 1600 jobs that will be created during construction for which Mainers will be given preference. So far 360 of the 470 people hired for the project are from Maine which is great. 77 percent!  All told the project will add $573 million to Maine's economy not including the incidental impacts like the spending by workers at stores in host communities.",political,Facebook

With the June 8th Lebanon elections around the corner I wanted to address a few referendum questions that I think there is confusion on Questions #42 #1 #2 #3 and #4. Question #42 is a citizens referendum created and pushed by Jeri Basko our Budget Committee Chairman and Michael Walsworth another Budget Committee member and former Milton resident. I talk about Mr. Walsworths former residence as it is in the State of New Hampshire where local taxes are higher due to no State of NH income tax and the fact that Mr. Walsworth only recently moved to Lebanon. I am not sure if Ms. Basko and Mr. Walsworth are behind the recent misleading illegal mailer because whoever distributed this mailer did not attach their name to it. However Mr. Walsworth has taken the position publicly during Budget Committee Meetings that we should push to raise our local property taxes. The Selectboard has taken the position that taxes should not be raised. Questions #1 #2 #3 are changes made to Lebanons 2020 Marijuana Ordinances that were passed by the voters and are currently in place in our town. Most of these changes to the ordinances were necessary due to challenges at the State level. Question #4 is to have the marijuana enforcement budget paid for entirely by Lebanons Marijuana Businesses by way of licensing fees. Lebanons Code Enforcement Officer is already stretched to the limit and is budgeted to work under 30 hours a week. Without raising taxes our Codes Officer just does not have the time to oversee the enforcement necessary for the marijuana businesses. If #42 does pass and #1 #2 #3 and #4 do not the burden of all local Marijuana enforcement actions will fall on our current officials employees and the necessary funds would come from your current tax budget. The passing of Question #42 will create an unregulated free-for-all in the Marijuana business here in town. Without raising taxes the town administration will be hard-pressed to control restrain or regulate any businesses that are out of compliance with State or Local marijuana laws. If #42 does not pass and #1 #2 #3 and #4 do pass the Local Marijuana business will be paying in the neighborhood $330000.00 (combined licensing revenue of all business) in fees that will go directly into our local government including payment for Code Enforcement legal costs to defend the town from marijuana issues and specialized equipment to help regulate the odor from growers. This special odor control equipment costs approximately $20000 dollars. (without this if a neighbor has an unregulated grow and in August the smell is overwhelming the Town cannot make them fix this). With these licensing fees the Code Enforcement Officer will become a full-time position allowing him the time and attention to enforcing Marijuana businesses that are in compliance with the law. Furthermore in this scenario the licensing fees will add an additional $140000 in legal funding secured in a separate account (NOT the Taxpayers) to regulate and fight against those acting outside of the ordinances. The mailer received by most town residents on 6/3/21 mentioned that there are pending lawsuits should Question not pass. I want to be clear that THERE ARE NO PENDING LAWSUITS. While it is true that there have been threats of lawsuits if #1 #2 and #3 are passed by the voters on June 8th 2021 what no one is mentioning is there have also been threats of lawsuits if these questions do not pass. Our proposed changes to the Marijuana Ordinances (Questions #1 #2 and #3) were reviewed and adjusted by a major law firm in Maine that has written several other towns' marijuana ordinances and is one of the leading Municipal Law Firms in the State. I would like to add that these ordinances were not created to stop the marijuana business from thriving in Lebanon. These businesses as legalized by the Citizens petition in the State of Maine will bring employment opportunities for many local residents. The final piece to this entire confusing situation is seen on your June 8th ballot as Referendum Question #5 Business Impact Fee Ordinance This choice will require only NEW businesses that come to Lebanon in buildings over 3200 square feet to help contribute (combined all fees) $450000 into our Emergency Services infrastructure which as we all know will need additional equipment should there be an emergency in a large facility of any type. The Marijuana businesses will be major contributors to this.,political,Facebook
Reverse Course  The Captain of the ship in the American wheelhouse needs to call out Reverse Course or else the United States is heading closer and closer to the drop of an economic waterfall to which much damage will be inflicted.  The combination of an unsustainable $30 Trillion in debt and a soon to be $4 Trillion more plus a manufacturing base that has all but been hollowed out and sold to China is spelling out in shining red flashing letters stop this insanity and wake up from this self imposed hypnotic trance that all is well and Reverse Course!  But what course should we reverse to?  We need a complete reversal of policy on American manufacturing and begin to re-build that infrastructure throughout the United States but this time with a focus on smaller niche manufacturing hubs in small towns and rural America.  Yes Artificial Intelligence (AI) is replacing many manufacturing jobs but there are still jobs that only humans can do and there must be an intelligent plan of action that outlines a blueprint for American growth and prosperity that can be set in motion and accomplished by 2032.  We need to take action now and recapture the American ideals and values that made us who we are.  China has a revenue and savings base of $45 Trillion dollars that are now being unleashed throughout many parts of the world to build infrastructure in many developing countries. They will very probably soon demand that all exports and imports be transacted in Chinese Renminbi currency and back that currency by gold and this could have dire economic consequences to the dollar as the worlds reserve currency.  No military can save us from economic defeat for a shot need not even be fired in such a scenario. We must reverse course and return to sound monetary policy to build the industrial base in this country. Social programs are important but without real productive growth our economy can not be sustained through the printing of Trillions of dollars. This is not real growth. It is fake growth. We need to reverse course. Now.,political,Facebook
Governor Cooper released his proposed budget for the next two years. This proposal presents an extraordinary opportunity to invest in a pandemic recovery that will benefit all corners and people of our state. It helps schools and children increases access to healthcare enhances protection for clean air and water invests in clean energy and invests massively in infrastructure. All of this will bring many new good jobs to NC. It would also almost double our state's savings. Here are some highlights (the link below is to the budget slides with more detail):  Education  Provides K-12 teachers 10% raises on average over the biennium and ensures all noncertified school personnel receive a minimum of $15/hour.  Invests more than $78 million in early education and child development.  Provides $80 million to help school districts hire more nurses counselors psychologists and social workers to support student physical and mental health.  Jobs and Infrastructure  Leverages available state funds as well as the states share of funds from the federal American Rescue Plan Act (ARP) which is expected to provide North Carolina over $15 billion in aid.  Invests to help small businesses thrive and provides funding to prepare rural and economically distressed communities for an innovation-based economy.  Proposes funding to address the disproportionate economic impact of COVID-19 on communities of color through increased support for minority-owned businesses.  Takes advantage of the states low debt and historically low interest rates and recommends placing a $4.7 billion General Obligation Bond on the November 2021 ballot to ask voters to address key infrastructure needs  Access to quality healthcare. It is time to expand Medicaid.  Expands Medicaid to provide access to health care for more than 600000 working North Carolinians keeping rural hospitals open and strong reducing the number of uninsured veterans helping fight the opioid epidemic and injecting over $5 billion in direct investment into the state by expanding Medicaid.  The American Rescue Plan provides an additional $1.7 billion in federal funds to support Medicaid expansion without the state covering any cost share for up to six years.  Clean Energy and a clean environment.  Invests over $100 million in expanding access to clean energy technologies investing in clean energy economic development and building the clean energy workforce pipeline to catalyze North Carolinas economy. Invests $10 million for clean energy economic development and $4.5 million in clean energy grants for homegrown start-ups and small businesses.  Clean safe water and air are essential for the health and well-being of North Carolinians. Includes more than $3.8 million each year for emerging compounds mitigation.  A safer more equitable North Carolina.  The COVID-19 pandemic continues to shine a light on long-standing inequities. This budget advances equity in our healthcare economic criminal justice and education systems allowing fair opportunities to share in our states recovery and success.

For Immediate Release: Our Response To President Bidens Visit to Idaho.  Mr. President We hope you enjoyed your time in Idaho this week. It must be a good feeling to get out of Washington DC. Unfortunately we were not able to connect while you were here. If we had been able to meet there are a few topics we would have discussed:  As with all things in life there are areas you can directly control those you influence and others you have no control over. As President there are clear boundaries about what you can control. As the 10th amendment says you can only do what is explicitly called out in the Constitution. Everything else must be done by influence. The Legislative branch has the ability to create laws but you do not. EVERYTHING else is owned by the states or individuals.  Over the past nine months of your presidency you have consistently overstepped your authority with states rights. Here in Idaho we believe in self-reliance and independence. Idahoans know what is best for Idaho - not you.  In addition the policies you have enacted are negatively impacting the next generation of Americans that we represent:  - Most small businesses are owned by the under 40 group. Increased regulation tax increases and mandates are suffocating small businesses. Thousands have closed their doors.  - Inconsistencies in your COVID communication is causing confusion and mistrust. Decisions on schools impact our children. Parents are trying to juggle careers with potentially having to stay home due to closures. Vaccine mandates risk the jobs for many young professionals. The federal government has no place in requiring private citizens or businesses to be vaccinated. You have violated your promise to never mandate vaccines when you campaigned. It also sets precedent for a scary future. You are not exhibiting leadership. It is coercion.  - The rising inflation is hitting Americans at a time without much discretionary spending available. Inflation is the highest since the 1970s. Home prices are the highest in history. Gas prices are averaging $2 per gallon HIGHER than just 10 months ago. While it may appear great to have a wage increase in jobs it doesnt matter if the cost increase is higher to do business. Those costs are passed down to consumers or businesses stop hiring as many people.  - Your unwillingness to address crime and homelessness in the country is impacting Idaho. Look at Seattle Chicago New York Portland. Do you really believe things are going well there? We have thousands of people from these states fleeing into Idaho because of the failed policies there. This is placing tremendous pressure on Idaho infrastructure land and energy use and more.  - A really in-depth conversation is needed about your foreign and military policy. We are very disappointed in your handling of Afghanistan to put it politely. The mismanagement cost the lives of young Americans.  - You came to discuss wildfires in Idaho but it turned into statements about global warming. While we all agree in being good stewards of the environment you neglected to the discuss the mismanagement of federal lands that make up about 70% of Idaho. This increases the likelihood of devastating forest fires.  Overall if you look at many of the nations key performance indicators almost all of them are trending worse than just one year ago. You must recognize this. Your poll numbers are lower and decreasing faster than any President during their first year in office.  Please recognize that we arent seeking to condemn. We genuinely want to help. You are the President currently. If you fail America fails. Please let us know if you have time to discuss further. Wed be happy to meet with you.  Oh one last thing It seems like every time you try to take questions your microphone stops working. Wed be happy to buy you a megaphone so you dont run into these technical issues anymore.  Sincerely Idaho Young Republicans    #idpol #idleg,political,Facebook

My dear Manvel brothers and sisters some of you may not know me. For those who don't know me my name is A John. For the past several years being a resident of this great City I have been watching silently about the growth potentials of the city. Yes we have a high potential and I appreciate our city officials and their vision that got us this far. I'm running for the council member seat #1  If given the opportunity to hold this position my first priority is to propose to our esteemed Mayor and other members of council to reduce or eliminate Property taxes for our own senior citizens in the community of Manvel TX. I feel our women and men of Manvel have earned the right to stop paying Property Taxes at the age of 65. They have paid their dues they have done enough.  Openness accountability and honesty define transparency. I will be open and accessible to the public. I will hold community engagements periodically.  I will Support and do my best to attract quality business in to Manvel to boost our economy. Why do we have to live here and spend our dollars to neighboring cities? Think about it. Dont we have to support our economy?  I will support fellow city council members decisions to ensure the safety health and wellness of the people of Manvel by rebuilding or developing the infrastructure.  I will do the best to empower our students and youths for the development of the community and make them globally competent,political,Facebook
The 13 Republicans who helped Pelosi pass a 1.2 trillion so called  infrastructure bill should be ashamed of themselves. These people know nothing about the evil ways of the  New Democrat party and its leaders. They never fight back for the benefit of their constituents or the American people. These massive expenditure are nothing but pork bribes and handouts to companies controlled by the democrats. It has little to do with so called bridges and roads & other infrastructure. These monies will fall into the hands of corrupt cronies of the democrats and for many more wasteful  projects. God knows how much will end up in secret slush funds for the democrats to bribe their way through for more power ! Biden now says that those who came illegally & got separated from their children should be massively compensated ! There seems to be no end to the corrupt ways of this administration & its democrat party. No immigrant would have been separated from any child or any family member if they had tried to come legally ! Shame shame shame ! How about massive compensation for the soldiers that got killed in Afghanistan & other foreign lands ! There is a war against US citizens in favor of foreigners who might vote democrat ! Its strictly about keeping power without merit or proper leadership ! Shame shame shame !,political,Facebook
As the election nears and you are listening to ideas and what all of the candidates are saying I feel that it is essential that I clarify what I have been working on and what I expect if elected:  1. Ive attended all of the EMS meetings focused on what we need to do to re-establish EMS and remove the temporary EMS suspension  2. I have been vocal at all of the open public meetings on what we can and should do to establish restrictions in the Cannabis Dispensary Ordinance. I dont want Eagle Nest to end up like Trinidad Colorado!  3. I want business to get back to normal and that includes opening The Senior Center. Many similar facilities throughout the state have reopened and we can and should do that as safely as possible. Many of you have spoken to me and said that this is important and I have listened and I agree!  4. Growing GRT and maximizing grants for infrastructure and beautification projects that increase pride in our community and drive more revenue to provide services to our residents  5. Business and Tourism - Immediately work to re-establish Eagle Nest Chamber of Commerce. Village and Chamber will work closely together and focus on promoting businesses and events  6. Community Events - Summer concert and movie series. Winter Carnival - ice sculpting tobogganing and events for the family  7. Government Transparency - Open door policy I will make myself available for anyone that wants to meet and discuss concerns and ideas. Every Friday I will have open office hours for community and business members to freely come to the Village and meet,political,Facebook
A Blue Valley patron asked me what I mean by the term language-focused teaching on my campaign webpage.  Below is my response. Its long  but it does articulate my primary motivation for running for school board.  This term language-focused teaching is one I developed to communicate what I believe is an urgent need to bring students literacy development into greater focus by creating an early intellectual infrastructure of advanced literacy knowledge and personal development for all students. It needs to begin in elementary school.  This is not a criticism of the current Blue Valley curriculum per se.  Rather it is a call for our community to respond to the rapid society-wide changes that have occurred in the past 15 years  starting most significantly in my view with the release of the first iPhone in 2007  and which have materially altered the way that we all consume and digest information.  We scroll and text a lot. We read and write a lot less. All the adults reading this grew up in a different literacy ecosystem than our children.  Blue Valleys reading scores have fallen year-over-year since 2015. Again this isnt a criticism of Blue Valley per se (though I do have suggestions for improvement)  its a statement about the reality of our changing culture. Every school in the state has seen a similar fall in reading scores.  Because academic training is compartmentalized into disciplines typically when one speaks of literacy it is reserved for how and what we teach in English (or ELA) classes.  What I am addressing however is a true inter-disciplinary approach to advanced reading writing and public speaking that needs to incorporate every intellectual discipline.  I have now experienced my fourth of five children to have gone through the Blue Valley schools and the level of training in long-form research and writing as well as in public speaking needs enhanced emphasis.  The complexity of the texts the volume of writing assignments the length of writing assignments and the extent of critical feedback needs to be materially enhanced for students of every level (whether AP standard track or remedial).  To allow teachers the time and energy to do this we need to really re-examine the quantity of courses for which our students and teachers are responsible in a semester.  A middle school teacher cant have 150 students in a semester and provide in-depth feedback to those students.  The process of writing is the true intellectual exercise including importantly the writing of mathematic equations and scientific formulas with precision.  It is that process that trains one to continue to learn well on his or her own after formal structured education is done.  That ability to keep learning well when nobody is watching or telling one to is the key to the universe.,political,Facebook
"America is being destroyed ! No not by the Russians not even by the Chinese or Iranians who would love to see America destroyed. Many foreign enemies would want the decline and destruction of America. This time the barbarians of destruction are from within. The Chinese are investing trillions of dollars all around the globe and almost every country including those in Europe and taking over economically and with immigration while American democrats and lefties are bent on destroying America. China is building new ports new infrastructure and new cities in China and abroad and America is eliminating borders and legal immigration. America is arguing for males to compete in female athletics and gender neutral bathrooms. The whole world is dependent on China for almost all products including medicines that are vital. Never in history have people who have it so good and lived in complete freedom and equality and opportunity tried to destroy the closest country to a utopia. It is the era of America last for the Americans in power. Trump was the last president to put or tried to put America first. The country that is systemically racist has more blacks and brown people and foreign born wanting to come and live in it ! Everybody wants to come here and those who live here and who criticize and hate this country won't leave ! More jews  more muslims more Asians more Latinos and more Europeans want to come here than any other place in the world. Even more Chinese and Russians and Iranians would come here if they could. The socialist democrats here are tearing the country apart from within. They attack the police border control agents small businesses white people the hard working religion traditional families traditions legal immigrants who respect the process and everything of conservative value. Now they attack free speech the right to bear arms and the integrity of voting. What is most perplexing is why ! why are they so anti-American and self hating and hating of others with a different opinion. No one seems to ask which country has been better to be in ? America is being destroyed and with it western culture will be eliminated soon. The ""news"" has become propaganda and misinformation.Big tech social media platforms have also become partisan and centers of censorship of conservatism and traditions ! If we do not stop this by becoming more active and spending time and effort to save our country the last best hope for mankind will be destroyed.Ask those who left their countries of birth and came here. There are millions of such people from Russia and the old USSR Cuba China Venezuela Iran Korea Vietnam Africa The Middle East India Europe and the rest of the world ! Even Australia and Scandinavian countries !! America with all its faults was the greatest country in history but it is truly being broken down.By enemies from within with help from outside now. God bless America it needs help !",political,Facebook
One week away from election. We have worked so hard since January. Researching listening building relationships and doing what it takes to earn your support.  At this time I would like to give you some details from our first 100 day plan. We all know our team stands on ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND MAKING THE CITY OF LOUISVILLE SAFER. WTBS we plan on working IMMEDIATELY with surrounding counties and entrepreneurs on bringing new industries into town. There is a great need for affordable housing in Louisville following the tornado in 2014 that left so many mourning the loss of their loved ones a well as their homes. Quality housing for young families looking to move here as well as those already establishing themselves here is a great need as well. We have already made connections with people and already have some plans in motion. I also think we can spread more city contracts in Louisville. Using the same vendors for services in Louisville doesnt spread the wealth throughout more entrepreneurs here. We plan to look into exploring some TIF District options to produce more industries immediately! I also plan to immediately get more involved with our school district.  We plan on working directly with our major factories here on offering technical training for the jobs of tomorrow for our teens. We plan to do this through paid internships. There are grants available for this type of assistance and my associates are already on top of doing what it takes to be eligible for them. I think teaching teens how to weld paint sew farm hook up electricity proper etc will create a more stable employability pipeline in Louisville.  I am very passionate about cracking down on crime in Louisville. I think we must get more serious about murder burglary robbery and drugs in Louisville. Especially when it comes to our teens. We have a lot of teens in our area with guns in their hand. That is one reason why we have plans for a gun buy back program. All unregistered guns stolen guns etc turned in will be rewarded by knocking off some funds on their fines. Let's not shy away from the truth! I think our investigators could have more resources to help solve crime. More police cars going home with officers WHO LIVE IN THE CITY LIMITS has been known to be successful in other areas as well. Research has shown that more police presence in the community helps lower crime. We must foster a better relationship between law enforcement and the community. We should be comfortable with our police officers. I feel there is a major distance between the two.  I also plan to research how we can get some state and federal assistance with our aging infrastructure. For example we have too many streets with pot holes. We also lack sidewalks throughout the city. A more walkable city in all areas help communities thrive. We could have more bike lanes in the city as well to help attract more bikers. It will make riding bikes safer for adults and children. All these things help attract more people to our town.  Last but not least we are very serious about more after school and recreational programs in Louisville. We need more programs for kids in single parent homes. These kids need help more than we know. I think this presence will help strengthen our community. I also have a great plan for prison reform. Something for serious convicts who want to come home and get back into the workforce. Another one of our immediate plans is to put two basketball goals at the Dawkins and MLK intersection. We only have 3 courts available in town and they are all in Ward 3 at one location. These plans are only a portion of our plans for better parks in Louisville. Only maintaining one park doesn't create use opportunities for all. There should be a park for kids near every major living area.  All these ideas are what we plan to jump into IMMEDIATELY if we are elected for office. Yes we are aware of the city budget however we wholeheartedly believe these ideas will help Louisville become a thriving community for all. The time is NOW Louisville. Let's be the change WE need!  Join our marathon and #RunWithRionJune82021 to make Louisville the GREATEST city in the state of MS!,political,Facebook
Please read and share!!  Keeping taxes low while improving services. This is how I will do it:  1. I will continue efforts to grow the Grand List  I will hold the line on new spending and keep Shelton predictable.  I will overtime work with Boards and Commissions to build a reasonable rainy day fund so we can weather any challenges ahead.  I will support well planned and appropriate development for our city.  I will level the playing field for investors and businesses so we get the best proposals for Shelton not only proposals from the same favored insiders.  I will work closely with property owners to fill vacancies and address underperforming properties.  I will work closely with the business community to ensure they have a good experience with the city so they stay and grow in Shelton.  2. I will improve management and operations.  I will immediately pursue an internal audit of all city expenses. I will ask those auditors to recommend improvements to our financial policies so the unfortunate theft and questionable practices of the past will not repeat themselves.  I will eliminate no-show jobs and department heads working from out of state. I will require that staff be in city performing their jobs for our residents each day.  I will listen collaborate and partner with departments Boards and Commissions outside organizations private businesses and other neighboring communities to address city priorities.  I will end costly ego based legal fees and lawsuits that are costing hundreds of thousands of dollars.  I will set a vision and priorities and communicate it to all city staff so we are working together to improve Shelton.  I will keep an ear to the ground for neighborhood issues so we can work together to make sure our neighborhoods are safe strong and wonderful places to raise families.  3. I will improve infrastructure and services.  I will divert the savings from no show jobs to hiring a full time grant writer that will bring in significantly more outside money annually to improve our roads buildings equipment public safety schoolsparks programs and serves. (Example- by eliminating the $80000 annual position for a Bridgeport State Representative who appears to be assigned to the police department but does not seem to reap much benefit to taxpayers is how I plan to fund this much needed position.) Eliminating this non-productive salary can be turned into millions!  I will meet with departments to get their ideas on how to improve services with our existing resources. Employees often have the best ideas they just have to be asked.  I will personally be in the city day in and day out not off seeking another elected office. I will take note of problems around our city and work with departments to address those problems.  I will hire highly qualified and community oriented staff for my team and we will greatly improve our constituent services out of the mayor's office. We will get back to people.  I will address the school bus situation so parents and children have safe and dependable transportation to and from school.  All of these efforts dont require new money from residents. We will better utilize our existing resources bring in new outside resources and/ or reallocate some resources.  We will do all of this and more together!,political,Facebook

Long-term economic development to me means we work now to make sure Mattoon is a place people want to live and work for generations to come. It also means we make smart sustainable investments in the community that will improve the welfare and quality of life for everyone.  So 1st to cover the employment/industry aspect of the economic long game we know that Lake Land is a major source of employment and I believe we need to more aggressively market Mattoon to companies that employ our Lake Land graduates. Offering incentives to those companies would be a smart and sustainable investment in our community.  And while we are talking about the Lakeland area I also think south Rt. 45 is a land of missed opportunity and now that the IL-16 exit has been so well developed its time for us to make South Rt. 45 exit a place people want to stop at too. A truck stop at the very least. Thats solid gas tax revenue we can use to improve some of our infrastructure.  Next to talk about the quality of life aspect of our economic long game... Modern Economic development means a lot more than just industry and business. It also addresses the social needs of the community. People want to live in a place that has recreation and entertainment as well educational and growth opportunities for all ages. Youth development family- friendly and senior programs places to visit shopping and dining. Also cultural and artistic opportunities that can grow our sense of community. And we can more aggressively market Mattoon in that way too. We do that my making our downtown area a place for all these things. My friend Rex said the words 'Brewery' and 'Time Theatre' in the same sentence the other day and I thought my brain was gonna blow up! Stuff like that. More music more outdoor theatre more things that encourage community involvement like by the city and the school system or the Lifespan Center or the YMCA working more closely together to develop more comprehensive and inclusive programs for all of our people. And we also need to have events that will bring in people from neighboring towns. Plan more events like the Celebrate Downtown Mattoon Christmas event. Plan events that highlight Mattoons really neat history and incorporate people's hobbies and interests such as combining the history of the railroad through Mattoon and hosting an event that would bring in railroad and model train enthusiasts.  Our economic long game also needs make our town a place of residential growth and development. Part of that is the city fulfilling their primary duty to the town providing for public safety. Making sure all of our city departments are adequately staffed and have the things they need to do their jobs. Restoring our existing neighborhoods by cleaning up the abandoned houses and public nuisance issuesas well as offering incentives to those wanting to restore or update their home. And pushing for development of new residential areas to attract families looking for a great place to raise their kids.  So thats my take on long term economic development. Local governments should always be looking to the future. They should be proactive as much a possible. They should encourage community involvement tell it like it is and bring all the ideas to the table when making city decisions. That is the kind of commissioner I will be and I would appreciate your vote on or before April 6th. #electable,political,Facebook
 Policy Position Post   TAXES   Typical politicians always talk about lowering your taxes when they ask for your vote. When you pay attention though you will notice they very rarely propose any actual ideas on how they will do that while maintaining or improving necessary government functions.  Both of my opponents have increased your tax burden after making campaign promises to the contrary.  I believe it is important as a candidate to not just tell you what you want to hear but also tell you how I plan to do it.  To begin one fact is inescapablePennsylvania provides tremendous natural resources and services to neighboring states and foreign countries. Carrying these burdens gives us the opportunity of new revenue sources that are not currently being taken advantage of here as they are in other states even Republican ones.  Clearly we have a responsibility to not only continue to fund our schools and our infrastructure at the level we are now but to also improve these areas; however the burden for this can no longer rest solely on you the residential taxpayer. Out-of-state tipping fees for imported garbage must be increased. We must initiate volume-based taxes on companies that export Pennsylvanias natural gas out-of-state and out-of-country and implement impact fees for the energy Pennsylvania produces and transmits to other states. We also must follow the lead of our neighboring states to legalize and tax recreational marijuana.  We can no longer allow you the taxpayers of Pennsylvania to fund better schools and government services in other states and other countries while continuing to pay ever-increasing taxes.,political,Facebook
"My name is Drew King a life-long resident of Illinois husband father of two dogs and a proud member of the Palatine community and I am running for the Illinois State House of Representatives.  When we look at our State we need to say that there needs to be a lot more up in the way in which its managed. It's time we get to taking care of our neighbors rebuilding the economy education reform and overhaul our public pension system.  Due to the pandemic it seems that every day we see our friends and neighbors struggling to find the money to afford food and pay their rent and mortgages. As a means of combating this I would push companies to halt layoffs by putting workers on part-time schedules with partial Unemployment Benefits. Id also request that the Federal Government provide better federal funding for these Unemployment Insurance programs during economic dilemmas like ours now.  Also affordable education is a must so that students can attend colleges and universities without the burden of graduating with an enormous amount of debt therefore I will work with Local Banks on providing little-to-no-interest Student Loans. If I had the opportunities for Work-Study and low-interest loans I would not have graduated with over $50000 in Student Loan debt which took close to 20 years to pay off. The importance of providing the next generation of students an achievable education cannot be emphasized enough and having a mother-in-law that taught for 30 years has only solidified my stance on this.  Just as I will focus on the Economy and making Education Affordable I will concentrate on Womens Rights and Healthcare for all. My plan would be to host health fairs at least twice a year in which one concentrates on Womens Health providing free breast cancer screenings and a second where I will work with local Healthcare providers to offer free drive-up STI Testing drives for those 14- to 21-years old.  As a pragmatic and fiscally responsible businessman I value cause and effects over details and circumstances and am pro-economic growth and pro-innovation.  As a political moderate a main focus that I have is a focus on helping the disenfranchised feel empowered to make strong confident decisions to be successful in life.  It is this importance of social equality that I bring to my day-to-day life by helping others hold themselves accountable and responsible in the areas in life which can be controlled through their abilities and talents and work on identifying areas out of their control and find methods to take back that control. This includes opposing political changes which would result in a significant shift of society strongly to either the left or the right.  Having worked since the age of 16 to support both my family and myself I have not given up on the working class unlike opponents on both sides of the political aisle due to their lengthy tenures in office that have led them down the path to represent the professional class.  To this day I value hard work determination and take pride in what Ive helped others to accomplish as well as what I have been able to accomplish.  I support Unions. All of the money that unions spend on the candidates that they endorse comes from the pockets of working people; it is precious. For Unions every dollar that is donated to politicians is a dollar that is not spent on organizing new union members therefore I will only seek endorsements from Unions and not accept campaign donations from these extraordinary hard workers.  I embrace policies that help people and are popular with the Democratic base but more importantly the broader public. Some obvious places to start include expanding Social Security increasing infrastructure spending across the country and lowering prescription drug prices.  When I say I'll embrace policies that means trumpeting them in headlines not hiding them away in the ""Policy"" section of my campaign's website burying them underneath cutesy unnecessary jabs at Republicans or relegating them to one paragraph of a 20-minute stump speech.  I have a commitment to pursue the interests of my potential constituents by having fiscally sustainable policies across a range of issues such as: - unemployment and the economy - health care reform - affordable education reform - property taxes - expanded voting rights - domestic violence - pension reform and - funds for our District  I will advocate for these in a bipartisan consensus rather than conflict with political opponents. I will act as a check and balance on legislation that I feel is too far to the right or too far to the left on the political spectrum.  After 10 years in office and just winning reelection there are a number of people who strongly feel that Tom Morrison the current IL State Representative representing the 54th District is out of touch and just as many feel his party the GOP is out of touch.  Mr. Morrison has proven that: - he is not an effective leader - is someone who does not listen to his constituents rather putting his own interests and beliefs before the interests and beliefs of those he is in office to represent and most importantly - has only co-sponsored (not sponsored) five Key bills in The House where some passed and others never made it past the Rules Committee (I feel he has not provided any benefit to this District or the State other than towing the Republican line in saying ""No"" when he's expected to).",political,Facebook
$82.7 million has been allocated to the city of Youngstown from the American Rescue Plan. Guidance for the use of funds includes discretionary use for crime prevention and mitigation. Essentially the funds are inactive and not being utilized while the streets are becoming more dangerous. My administration will use ARP Rescue Plan funding to address crime issues that have escalated.  Crime Prevention is my number one priority for building a Civic Infrastructure!  The citizens are demanding a better quality of life and I am ready to deliver for Youngstown!  #electhill #visitthehill #votehill,political,Facebook
I humbly ask for your vote today March 20th  I want to fix the major disconnect between our government leaders and our residents by upgrading technology currently being used such as better communication through social media parish app individual council members apps for direct communication. I want to put live web cams at drainage canals and pumps for instant notification of problems and responses. I believe flooding is currently being fixed with great current multi million dollar projects already approved and in process however as we keep adding subdivisions we simple need better checks and balances on major infrastructure issues such as but limited to flooding to avoid the past mistakes. I believe recent flooding could have been avoided if their was not this major disconnect between our administration council and residents especially the new residents.  Second we must upgrade all of our recreation facilities for our children and new children moving here as we continue to add homes and families. I firmly believe kids need more athletics or other outside activities and less video games. Our recreation facilities clearly do not match up with other parishes and I want to fix that.  Third I want to take a fresh new look at major traffic problems that we have had for years that our administrations and councils appear to just pass blame down on to others like railroad companies and DOT.  I hope I answered your questions about my agenda if you have any specific questions or concerns I would love to hear them please post or IM. I Further sincerely ask for your vote this Saturday March 20th.  Paid for by Joseph Ciro Larre campaign fund,political,Facebook
An Important Message to those we serve:  Recently the 2021-2022 budget was approved by the Board of Fire Commissioners and presented to the public for a vote of acceptance. Unfortunately this budget did not pass approval by those that came out to vote. While many people would not advocate for the raising of taxes to support governmental needs it has proven to become necessary in the interest of continued improved public safety and delivery of water services a vital need to all residents and businesses. It is also probably likely that misinformation has been spread including some suggestions to cut money made at the last budget meeting on May 24 by the sole commissioner who opposed accepting the budget. We would like to share some of the experiences our members deal with daily in support of the mission of the Cromwell Fire Department our brothers and sisters of IAFF Local 4662 the Fire Marshal Office and the Water Division. In this business we know that even if your opinion is not in the majority you must stick together to support the mission you are tasked with overall. If is often easy to put the needs of these services at the bottom of the priority list because most people live their entire lives unimpacted by the need for emergency services however much like the insurance policy you have on your home or car it is certainly there when you need it most and werent planning on it. As the cost of apparatus infrastructure upgrades and equipment continue to rise we ask you to consider the impact of this budget to the overall mission of protecting lives and property and delivering a quality water service. We are fortunate to work with the Commission to help them deliver quality services to those that live and work in Cromwell.  The Fire District Board of Fire Commissioners has spent hours upon hours vetting and discussing the budget for the upcoming year much like the local government does. There has been meeting after meeting open to the public totaling well over 15 hours to try to come up with a budget that works for all. For years the District has prided itself in keeping rates for its taxpayers low. From our members attending this years budget process meetings it is clear there is nothing else to trim from the budget that would not directly impact the safety of the public in a negative manner. They have gone back to the drawing board and approved a slight modification to the original budget presented that will be voted on for approval on Monday June 7.  Due to necessary changes in staffing plans in the Fire Department two years ago the town is now served by a fire department fully on duty 24/7/365. In addition to the staff on duty the fire department utilizes a small number of part-time and volunteer personnel that can be recalled for larger emergencies and like many communities the department struggles with the availability of these personnel. Prior to that our Dispatchers would alert responders to calls and wait upwards of 5-10 minutes for someone to try to respond. You now have Fire/EMS responders that are responding from their location in the firehouse within seconds and arriving on scene within minutes of the call. In comparing the mill rates of surrounding agencies you will see that the increase proposed remains lower given what is provided to those in Cromwell. Additionally those agencies are utilizing entirely full-time employees while Cromwell uses part-time personnel to offset costs. Grants have been awarded to the Department to offset the costs of this staff and it is time to plan responsibly and invest in the future of the Fire Department as the demand for service grows with the growth of the Town of Cromwell as a whole. Kicking the can down the road is no longer a viable option and will prove to be a dangerous gamble in terms of life safety.  From May 2020 to May 2021 the call volume within the District has risen by 8.51%. This is before we even discover what the addition of the new Missionary Road complex Field Road developments and Nike Site condos will bring to the demand for services in additional call volume. There are currently 6 FF/EMTs staffing one BLS ambulance and one fire suppression piece around the clock attempting to adhere to NFPA standards regarding fire protection response and safety standards. When a second medical call occurs the Dispatchers must tone out off-duty personnel to respond and hope that someone answers the call within two minutes. If not the call is transferred to a mutual aid transport agency to respond which can add minutes to the response times if they are even available to take the call. The average time to acquire a mutual aid ambulance was 5.57 minutes utilizing this system. This is the time it takes for the Dispatcher to locate a service in the area that can respond to Cromwell to assist with the call. This does not include the time it takes them to arrive on the scene which showed an average total of 18.42 minutes from the time of call made. The longest time for an ambulance to respond was 44 minutes. Imagine you are waiting nearly 20 minutes or more after calling 911 for an ambulance to show up to transport your loved one. We cannot explain to you what it is like to answer a phone call from someone who has already called 911 asking if the ambulance is on the way while trying to do the best you can to comfort them and assure them that help is on the way given the resources you have at hand.  During the COVID pandemic the District implemented a 7th Firefighter/EMT responder on duty during peak times to provide for the ability of the 2nd Ambulance to respond by on-duty staff. The staffing allows for one fire suppression piece and two staffed BLS ambulances. The 5.57 minutes to acquire an ambulance for the second call was cut down to 45 seconds to dispatch our own resources that are available. The average response time was cut from 18.42 minutes to approximately 7 minutes with our own staff able to respond. There is no question that this staffing is a benefit to those that rely on services in their greatest time of need. The minimal proposed increase to the fire district mill rate includes covering the cost of this ability to staff two ambulances during identified peak times of call volume which during COVID is something that was unanimously approved by ALL Commissioners. Relying on Mutual Aid agencies for every day calls is not a viable answer. It is an expense to taxpayers in other communities paying for those services and they are often unavailable in a timely manner. Furthermore the use of mutual aid services means that another organization receives the money generated by EMS transport leaving a void in the Cromwell Budget.  The 7th Firefighter/EMT position also does not exist solely for EMS response. On-duty staff provide fire protection when available as well. The 7th Firefighter adds to the amount personnel available to respond to ALL Calls. Using emergency dispatch protocol our members gather information while taking emergency calls to determine the most appropriate response. Our system will determine the correct response and dispatch services appropriately. According to NFPA 1720 the standard which dictates the Organization and Deployment of Fire Suppression Operations by Combination and Volunteer Fire Departments the Fire Department in a suburban area shall strive to have a minimum of 10 personnel to respond with a response time of 10 minutes from notification. The 7th on-duty responder helps to meet this goal by raising the total staff on duty a guaranteed response. This staffing model also creates a safer working environment for the firefighters responding to emergencies who are already tasked with trying to do more with less which can be extremely dangerous. The Cromwell Fire Department averages a total of 2500 calls for service annually. When the primary ambulance is unavailable the 7th FF/EMT will allow the second ambulance to be staffed or the remaining 5 personnel on duty to mitigate other emergencies thus again reducing the reliance on Mutual Aid services being paid for by other communities.  Closing the West Street Fire Station as a cost saving measure as was ridiculously suggested proves as a useless means as a cost saving measure. The location and use of three fire stations in Cromwell allows for a reduced insurance rate for fire protection. The Insurance Services Office (ISO) provides ratings that consider many factors including 50% that comes from your fire departments staffing and firehouse locations. The proposed small mill rate increase would be minimal compared to the reduction in ISO rating that would skyrocket homeowner and business insurance rates. This location also not only provides home to the District Offices but also to the Fire Marshal Division and is the home to the marine unit near the Connecticut River.  The Water Division is also a vital service to the residents and businesses of Cromwell. For years they have been an understaffed division trying to manage as best they can. After keeping rates low to users for many years the time has come to provide better service. We urge you to compare the rates of surrounding communities to see that the rates paid currently are the lowest around. They are in dire need of an additional set of hands and the means to hook up connections to the north and south to prepare for any emergencies to our own infrastructure. Our Dispatchers not only answer every emergency call for Fire/EMS services but also monitor the facilities and alarms for the Water Division. During non-business hours all calls related to water division emergencies and inquiries are received in the Communications Center. Water Division personnel are on call 24/7 to answer calls and repair equipment. Calling for your Cromwell Fire District Water personnel cannot be compared to the level of service of any other utility. This is a local service meaning a quick response and the customer service is invaluable. The increased water rates may seem extensive at face value but the water division requires many infrastructure upgrades to better serve you the ratepayer. A portion of the upcoming budget is set for a pre-engineering study to prepare to connect services to the South (Middletown water) and to the North (MDC). Currently the Districts 4-million-gallon tank is required to undergo draining inspection and maintenance making the interconnection project necessary. The interconnection is also vital in the event of an infrastructure failure allowing water service to continue to residents and businesses. The Water rates have not been raised in 13 years in Cromwell and the proposed rate increase is less than $12/quarterly bill on the average water bill. Please consider the need of water service and delivery in your understanding of this budget proposal. In addition to the 50% of the ISO rating mentioned previously 40% of the scoring criteria comes from the availability of the water supply. The infrastructure upgrades to the water division will also aid in keeping your home insurance rates low.  In closing we wish to thank the 8 Fire Commissioners Executive Director and Department Heads for doing what is best overall in the interest of the taxpayers in Cromwell. While trying to keep the desperately needed increase low they have taken a stance to better protect those that live work and visit here and plan for the future. Through their fiscal responsibility rates have been kept extremely low in comparison to other communities and utility companies. At the next meeting for the budget on June 7 from 6pm-8pm we strongly urge those who may need us for services in the future to consider the approval of the proposed budget to protect themselves their families and their friends.  Sincerely The Executive Board of AFSCME Local 1303-475 Cromwell Professional Emergency Dispatchers,political,Facebook
"My name is Drew King and I am running as a Democrat for the Illinois State House of Representatives. As a life-long resident of Illinois husband father of two dogs and proud member of the Palatine community I look forward to serving my constituents.  My upbringing in Illinois consisted of a one-income working family with a stay-at-home mom where my parents instilled ethics morals and values in me.  I grew up with my mother taking care of my sister and me while my father worked hard to provide us everything he could. We lived paycheck-to-paycheck and that made it hard at times. I remember the sound of bill collectors calling our home at all hours and I saw my family's vehicles be repossessed. No matter how hard things were my parents felt it was important for their children to receive a good education and instill values of morals and ethics which I still hold true to this day.  I also learned how fragile financial security is and that things need to change and I am confident in saying that that we need a lot more of ""up"" in Illinois and it's time for a change.  What do I mean by up?  It means that instead of looking down at how our State is being run we need to look up - we need to look forward to what can be achieved and make the necessary changes to work together Democrats and Republicans alike to have a more prosperous State.  At 16 years of age I began to work part time jobs to help my parents make ends meet. This showed me the importance of working together as a family toward a common goal. I am the first person in my family to not only go to college but graduate.  Later in life I became a self-taught businessman working in Information Technology with Teams both in the States and Internationally in the UK and India. Throughout my career I have never given up on the working class. To this day I value hard work determination and take pride in what Ive helped others to accomplish as well as what I have been able to accomplish myself.  Today we find ourselves in turbulent financial times during which many people have had to take pay cuts been furloughed or even worse lost their jobs. There needs to be a stronger focus on helping our neighbors put food on their table and be able to afford to pay their rent or mortgage.  As CDC Guidelines are relaxing there are still working-class families that have not been able to afford to get back to work even with Federal Government funds due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Rising childcare costs healthcare costs and low wages make it difficult.  I support programs that will bring more jobs  for example having more infrastructure projects in the greater Palatine Arlington Heights Prospect Heights and Rolling Meadows areas. The biggest way for job creation is through job training and job retainment programs which increase the availability of jobs and address changes in the knowledge required for the evolving workforce.  In our District we need to move towards vocational training which is already on an upswing. School District 211 for example has an award-winning nationally recognized program for vocational education but we need to do more. We need to make community colleges free for those 16+ that have graduated from High School. Harper College currently offers programs to ensure that education is accessible and affordable so that people can improve their education and job skills but we need to do more.  I will focus on the Economy and making Education affordable and I will also concentrate on Womens Rights and affordable Healthcare in the State but most importantly this District.  I plan to host health fairs twice a year where one will concentrate on Womens Health with speakers from local Healthcare providers and a second where I will work with local organizations to offer free drive-up STI testing drives for those 14- to 28-year-olds. Affordable and accessible healthcare is important to me.  A focus that I have is on helping the marginalized feel empowered to make strong confident decisions to be successful in life.  It is this importance of social equality to where I bring my life experience towards helping others hold themselves accountable and responsible in the areas in life which can be controlled through their own abilities and talents and work on identifying areas out of their control to try and find methods to take back that control.  As a political moderate I would oppose political changes which would result in a significant shift of society strongly to either the left or the right.  I also understand how the LGBTQ African American Asian American Hispanic-American and other marginalized communities feel disenfranchised and vulnerable because these groups are statistically less likely to be in full-time employment and much more likely to face barriers in accessing employment have less opportunities for employment or have to leave a job due to discrimination.  To that end a big focus on my campaign and my hope for our area in general is improving racial relations. There has been a lot of tension particularly in the last year or so during the pandemic revolving around race.  From George Floyds death to anti-Asian comments regarding the origins of the pandemic the crisis at our Southern Border and more I believe it is in our collective best interests to better improve these relations in this district Illinois and across the country.  There is still work to be had so that these marginalized groups of people have the basic rights of everyone around them.  I support Unions. This area of the State is known for being Union-friendly because we know the stability a Union provides for wages and benefits that help bring people out of poverty.  I will advocate for policies that benefit our District and State in a bipartisan consensus rather than having conflict with political opponents acting as a check and balance on legislation that I feel is too far to the right or too far to the left on the political spectrum.  If elected the day I arrive in Springfield I will collaborate with freshmen and incumbent Representatives to propose legislation to build policy proposals into law.  Thank you and I would be humbled to receive your vote!  #District54 #KingForIL54 #BDrewKing #Democrat",political,Facebook

On the day before Election Day I want to take this opportunity to remind Oakmont Voters why I along with my fellow Democratic candidates are the best choice for Council.  Growing up in the New Kensington and Arnold area I always admired Oakmont for its small businesses and vibrant community. When our daughter Ashley was finishing grade school at Mary Queen of Apostles 15 years ago my husband Al and I moved to Oakmont and enrolled her in Riverview High School. Now we are here to stay into retirement and beyond. Perhaps because I wasnt born here in Oakmont I am even more invested and appreciate the safety and growth in our community.  I have the qualifications to serve our community and genuinely enjoy giving back. I am a Human Resources Executive for a global energy company. I am also the Vice-President of Oakmont Commons Homeowners Association Secretary of the Oakmont Democrats Co-Chair of the Pittsburgh Women for Economic and Leadership Development and a member of the Oakmont Elks. I have a Bachelors in Human Resources a Masters in Labor Relations and a Doctorate in Organizational Leadership. My husband Al a military veteran and I have 2 daughters Ashley and Mara and a grandson Arlo.  Through this election I along with my fellow Democratic candidates have focused our platform on 3 main areas  Community Sustainability and Integrity.  If elected I would like to specifically focus on the following:   Research and secure additional funding including grants to help maintain and upgrade our infrastructure for storm water management particularly considering our continued growth.  Support and partner with local small businesses with a variety of projects such as zoning to continue to build on our small town appeal and remain welcoming and inclusive to all families.  Talk to and listen to all of our neighbors regardless of party to help address the day to day issues with viable solutions.  It has been my pleasure to meet a lot of you through this process either by talking to you at your door or at the various events we have attended together. Oakmont is truly a diverse and growing community that needs representation to help continue to move it forward. I feel we can do so if elected to serve you on Council.  Thank you in advance for your consideration and hopefully your vote. I look forward to seeing you at the polls tomorrow.,political,Facebook

What does economic development mean to you?  When I used to hear economic development I always shifted my thoughts to business. Whether it was attracting promoting or growing it was always about business. After spending time speaking with hundreds of Mattoon residents researching successful cities and asking the right questions Ive learned that economic development is much more.  Economic development is a plan. Economic development is a goal. Economic development is a necessity.  So what does economic development mean to me? It is improving the overall economic and social aspects of our community. It is improving our infrastructure parks playgrounds and more. It is expanding recreational opportunities for all ages. It is expanding services to our elderly. It is recruiting good paying jobs that employ our local employers and attract workers from other communities. Its reducing crime and getting people who are struggling with drug addictions off the streets and into programs. Its promoting new residential construction and attracting families to live and grow in Mattoon.  It is getting the right people in the right spots to formulate short and long term planning to achieve our goals.  Remember to vote for Trent Seiler. #1OnTheBallot #1Choice,political,Facebook

Re: The Residents of Doral demand fair treatment in the annexation process  Dear Doral Resident  On December 23 2020 our City submitted a proposal to the Miami Dade County Commission for annexation of Section 35 and 36 which covers the newly developed area just west of the Turnpike between NW 25th street and NW 12th street. Many might recognize the area from some of its known shops including The Home-Depot City and Ashley Furniture Marshalls Michaels Arts and Crafts Dicks Sporting Goods Top Golf Telemundo and several others. Annexation is the process by which a city asks the county for approval to expand its boundaries to include the area being annexed. While the City of Doral would be responsible for providing public services to this area our city would also be entitled to the tax revenues businesses within the area generate.  The City of Sweetwater also submitted their proposal for annexation of this area as part of its proposed boundary change.  The process requires Miami-Dade Countys Planning Advisory Board to review study and make a recommendation to the County Board of Commissioners before the entire Commission votes on which citys proposal will be approved.  The City of Doral is part of County Commission District 12 and our elected representative is Commissioner Jose Pepe Diaz. Commissioner Diaz is also the current Chairman of the Commission and as a result presides over all the Commission meetings. Commissioner Diazs District 12 encompasses the areas of Western Miami-Dade and includes the cities of Doral portions of Hialeah Hialeah Gardens Medley Sweetwater and Virginia Gardens in addition to a large portion of unincorporated Miami-Dade County.  On May 4th Commissioner Diaz proposed a change to Miami Dade County Code sections 20-3.1 and 20.5 which are two of the key sections that govern the annexation process. His proposed change to the definition of the word contiguous essentially eliminates Dorals annexation proposal altogether. The Commissioners proposed change to the rules is scheduled for debate and approval before the County Commission on July 20th .  It is without question that changing the rules of any government procedure in the middle of the process is not fair. We believe the City of Doral is the municipality best prepared and most apt to serve the area it seeks to annex. Our city has the most solid infrastructure a low tax rate and the experience servicing major entities such as those occupying this area.  The Doral Community Coalition sent a letter to Commissioner Diaz on July 7th expressing our concerns. We are humbly asking that you send a letter or an email to the County Mayor and all 13 Commissioners demanding fair treatment for Doral. All we are asking for is impartiality transparency and healthy discussions on each cities proposals.  We are committed to and will continue to support good governance.  -DORAL COMMUNITY COALITION www.doralcommunity For any further questions or clarification you can email us at doralcommunitycoalition@gmail.com.  SAMPLE LETTER TO MAYOR AND COMMISSIONERS  Dear Commissioner  A proposed ordinance has been presented by Commissioner Jose Pepe Diaz amending the rules of annexation in clear detriment to the proposal presented by the City of Doral in December of 2020. This change in the rules in the middle of the annexation process is totally unfair.  Commissioner Diazs proposed change does not allow for a decision on the merits. We ask that you reject the Commissioners proposal and allow Dorals annexation application to move forward within the rules that existed at the time Dorals annexation request was filed. It is the only way to ensure fair treatment for the residents of Doral.  Sincerely  Commissioners Emails:  Oliver gilbert III District1@miamidade.gov Jean Monestine district2@miamidade.gov Keon Hardemon district3@miamidade.gov Sally A.

It may come as a surprise to many but 2 million people in the United States lack access to basic plumbing. While innovations in toilets continue to rise to the surface  and continue to be a key point of focus for our design and engineering teams  these toilets ultimately sit atop an infrastructure system that is broken and in great need of repair.  Earlier this year the U.S. Chamber and the Bipartisan Policy Center along with a large group of diverse business policy and labor organizations launched the Build by the Fourth of July campaign urging Congress to enact a fiscally and environmentally responsible infrastructure package by the Fourth of July. LIXIL Americas continues to support the hundreds of other national and local organizations calling on Congress to pass comprehensive infrastructure legislation.

Investing in Nixa's future!  We all may have other things on our minds as we head into fall (back-to-school Friday night football or an upcoming election) but there is nothing like a good annual budget conversation to get our focus back to the critical issues in our community. Over the last 10 years City Council has worked hard to put Nixa in a solid financial position. Our careful planning helped the municipal government be able to navigate the financial challenges presented by the pandemic and to be ready to grow as we move forward. One of the key elements of our plan has been an over 80% reduction in the City's debt since 2011 - from $23.3 million in 2011 to only $4 million at the end of 2020. City Council has also invested in growing our local economy. Without raising Nixas sales tax rate at all in the last decade Nixa has seen a 65% increase in our general sales tax revenue over these same 10 years which proves stronger total sales by businesses located inside our city limits. In fact our local businesses have shown collective sales growth each year since 2010 including a 14% increase in 2020 and 12% increase so far in 2021. The biggest ticket items this tax revenue pays for are police and streets. These good numbers dont even take into account the addition of the local Use Tax approved by Nixa voters in 2018. The Use Tax was not a new tax nor an increase to the Sales Tax. Rather the Use Tax extended the same city sales tax rate (1.5%) so that it now also applies to purchases made from the giant online stores just as it always has for brick-and-mortar stores here in town. This finally put local businesses on a level playing field as they compete against those giant online stores which used to have an unfair price advantage because they didnt have to charge local sales tax (despite the fact their delivery trucks use our city streets and our police had to investigate if packages were stolen from porches). Now as the pandemics financial repercussions have cut key revenue streams (such as the interest we earn on money in the bank) thanks to that 2018 vote the Use Tax revenue has balanced out those losses. Despite the rapid growth of our citys population (over 4200 new residents since 2010) our slow-but-steady revenue growth and restraint in spending have allowed us to keep up with the increased costs needed to make sure the city doesnt sacrifice the quality of our public services as we stretch to serve more people than ever. We didnt just keep up we also made investments to improve existing services and fully staff the Nixa Police Department. On top of that we even saved some money for future park improvements as well as economic development projects aimed at helping local businesses succeed so they can bring more good jobs to Nixa. Along with the funding provided by the American Rescue Plan for local governments Nixa has never been in a better position financially. This year I will work with Council to utilize these resources to invest in Nixa's future. Some projects under consideration include major park upgrades funding regional water and wastewater infrastructure projects allowing for continual improvement of our police department and investing in technology and automation - all of which will reinforce Nixas reputation as one of the most innovative cities in Missouri. If you are interested in learning more about these plans or want to be part of the City's budget process I hope to see you at a council meeting this fall.,political,Facebook
My name is Jill Gumble and I'm asking for your vote in becoming the city council representative for the North West district.  I moved to Hutchinson in 1996 and married Mitch Gumble in 1997. We have 3 grown children and 4 grandchildren. In 1997 I began my real estate career with Astle Realty now known as Plaza Astle Realty Inc. and worked for 15 years with Realty Executives 4Results. In 2000 my husband and I started a local retail furniture and appliance store and we are still in business today. In 2002 we purchased our first rental property and currently own numerous quality affordable rentals throughout Hutchinson.  I have served with the following organizations and boards: I was an Ambassador with the Chamber of Commerce I served on the Board of Directors for the Hutchinson Board of Realtors I was involved in the development of the City of Hutchinson Landlord/Tenant handbook and I'm currently the President of the Central Kansas Landlords Association.  While my background is heavy in housing and real estate I also fully understand the financial challenges a new business faces when considering opening their doors. The cost of a new mortgage insurance inventory and labor can become overwhelming. But when faced with Hutchinson's restrictive building codes and requirements high property taxes and the additional expense of the Storm Water Utility fees ....the obstacles become burdensome and less cost effective. The numerous vacant commercial properties in our town are a direct reflection of the obstacles being too much for a new business to budget and justify. Our city MUST become more welcoming and supportive of any individual or company wanting to invest their money into our community.  My main focus is to partner with The Chamber of Commerce to bring in new business create new jobs to creates new sources of revenue for our city. Additionally we must continue to make allowances for a strong and viable infrastructure. Core services must be protected and funded FIRST when establishing our city's budget. This includes making sure our first responders have the supplies and resources they need to work safely and effectively.  I've invested my money and efforts into the city of Hutchinson. And I believe in Hutchinson's abilities to become a stronger community. It's time to make Hutchinson strong again. And with a stronger economy we will build a stronger community.  I thank you for your consideration and would greatly appreciate your support along with your vote in November.,political,Facebook
