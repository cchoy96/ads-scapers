"This a call to all Patriotic Texans  As some you may or may not be aware of there is a very large illegal alien caravan headed towards the Sovereign Texas border on/about 25 October 2021. We must put a stop to this and help our states and local Law Enforcement Agencies LEAs to assist them in every way possible in order for them to do their jobs effectively and efficiently.  I am leaving the Federal agencies out due to the fact that their hands are tied behind their backs and for no other reason.  These are the locations were we are needed: El Paso Del Rio El Centro Laredo Rio Grande and Brackettville.  Just to let all of you know. Last night on OAN news a Mexican U.S. based activist made a declaration of war either against the Mexican National Guard or the U.S. National Guard. His exact words were We are ready for war. With or without proper papers if the National Guard comes and they are so cowardly to want war to hit women and children then get ready because we go from the hand of god.""  As if we were the ones that are going to lay hands on women and children. I believe he want the National Guard from Mexico or the U.S. to hurt or harm a woman and child. It would play right into his hands. Now that sounds very much like an affront all Texans.  So let get together in cars trucks and RVs with the Texas flag waving proudly on our vehicle of choice and head to Texas border city nearest you.  Ill be seeing you there.

"RANDOM PSYCHOLOGY 131 Welcome been a few days now that I talked said anything in particular time slips away and life is as life always is it is ""busy"". BTW if you are new here  as in if you have joined the page recently qelcome and thank you also please share the page with your friends or on your timeline I will appreciate that. Also if you like they page you can always come back for more I hope that you do. What is the purpose of life? It used to me that many smart people spent their lifetimes looking for a purpose and meaning. Most of us  however are too busy today to spend time contemplating. We talk about the attitude of people when in reality we are actually talking about ourselves only in third person as if the words we are speaking do not describe us individually. I have told you before that I am not a religious or a moral person I do not mean to offend anyone. If you have a God more power to you if you don't it is not my business. Whether you belive in a god or many or none there seems to be a common lesson in most if not all religions which is the same lesson that we can derive from the so called modern day spirituality or the ancient philosophies also. If the ""spirituality "" tries to teach us to let go to let it be to stop worrying and such then does a belief in an omnipotent God also not require the same? If God is in control and God is in charge and if the God's will is done then why are we obsessed with fixing the problems especially with other people while we ignore our own short comings and work on fixing those first. M. N. R. 13 JUN 2021  A little while ago I posted a short article that I came across from another page about bicycles I will leave it up for you to look at. Back in 1989 I gave a lecture on Drugs and community and later in 2007 I wrote about ""War on Poverty""  ( I will post it here again after sometime). Our leaders the politicians are not stupid they know how poverty is good for the economy how the poor create more jobs than the so called ""job creators"" how the little money given to the poor helps them create tens of millions of jobs while the poor are blamed for staying poor. If you don't agree just look at this one small fact if the poor did not get free money they will compete for the menial jobs and drive down the minimum wage. Whether you get all your money from welfare or from a minimum wage job you make almost the same amount. Similarly the drugs and crime are used to create jobs and increase the GDP. Just look at how many jobs are dependent on the drug abuse and crime. The police the lawyers the doctors ambulance crews nurses bondsman detectives  judges jailers prison guards social workers drug abuse counselors the drug makers the list can go on and on all making money and contributing to the increase in GDP. The law makers don't want this to go away. Similarly petty crime to assault and murder to spousal abuse create jobs. A race war that is short of an outright civil war will be welcomed by our leaders as it will consolidate their base and make the economy look good and no one will notice. The first step here is for the public to understand that the politicians in both sides are in on the scam they are happy that you are focusing on and blaming the problem on eachother and they are not even trying to solve the problem. I will have more to say soon like and share the page please and let's talk. M. N. R. 14 JUNE 2021",political,Facebook
We have had many wise leaders throughout our history. Maybe we should heed there words of wisdom. Such as the words of Abraham Lincoln.  We have forgotten God. We have forgotten the gracious hand which preserved us in peace and multiplied and enriched and strengthened us; and we have vainly imagined in the deceitfulness of our hearts that all these blessings were produced by some superior wisdom and virtue of our own.  President Lincoln was right. We have forgotten God. And its even truer today than when he made that proclamation in 1863. Weve tried to push God out of the courtroom out of the classroom and for all practical purposes out of our culture.  This is what we have to fight for. We have to bring God back into all areas of our culture. The first of these need to be our schools. Our schools were started by the church. though once the government got their hands into it God was removed.  We Need God Back in Our Schools.  This is a Fight for our Future. This is a Fight for our Children. We have to have people such as me on the school boards. People like me will fight and not back down. People like me will stand strong and not let the pressure of our society sway us. People like me will base their actions upon biblical principles and truth first. People like me are not liked by all because we are outspoken and we say what we think. We speak truth no matter if it hurts a person ego or feelings. People like me will fight hard for our children and our schools. We need people like me that know what their job as a school board member is for THE CHILDREN AND PARENTS AND TAXPAYERS.  Some who run think the job of the school board is to help the teachers. Well I tell you this. ITS NOT! The teachers are not the School Boards responsibility as they have a big multi million dollar union that fights for them. The school boards number one and sole priority is FOR OUR CHILDREN. So when people that will run for school board make comments suggesting that they will help the teachers get that raise. Then that is not the kind of person we need. I also am not saying teachers shouldnt get a raise. Though I am saying giving raise to all when not all deserve it is the issue.  Parents and Taxpayers of Gibsonburg School District in Ohio. We have to take our schools back from the grips of the politicians and give it back to the children and the parents and taxpayers. We have to take it back so that the teachers can do their actual jobs again and that is to teach. We have to vote people like me on to the Gibsonburg School Board to help steer our schools back on track.  Please get out and vote for Justin Chafin for Gibsonburg School Board on November 2 2021. We have to have change for our childrens sake.  If you have questions or comments please let me know. I will look into problems and start doing more research on issues you bring to me. As I am working on two issues now getting up to speed and digging in to see where the problems are at in the system.  Thank you all and God Bless  OUR CHILDREN OUR COMMUNITY OUR FUTURE,political,Facebook
"Yesterday I sent out a newsletter from my campaign to my supporters that gave a little more info as to whom I am and the values that I believe in. Most of you know my name or face but beyond that more can be found in the following text of my newsletter titled ""The Future is Yours and it Starts Now""    Sep 10 2021  I want to talk about why we need a change on our Board of Supervisors in Frederick County and why I am running. We need to ensure that our children have a bright future for their own children which is why we need leaders with vision  not just individuals with political agendas.  Many of you only know me by name or face but let me tell you a little about myself. I was born in Arizona and lived there 40 years before moving to California. Phoenix was where I met my beautiful wife to whom Ive been married 44 years. We have two children both of them raised with a strong religious foundation. We were also very involved with our childrens schools participating in the PTA. My wife was Homeroom Mom.  In 1990 my job took us to the San Diego area. Our son and daughter both received their degrees from a local college and went on get their Masters. My daughter moved to Virginia in 2004 working for the government. She married eight years ago and now has two children. My son moved to Virginia in 2006 married his husband five years ago and also works for the government.  You and I have followed different paths but we have experienced many of the same hardships and joys and we share similar dreams. We lived paycheck-to-paycheck early in my career sometimes working two jobs to ensure that our children were able to get the best that we could give them.  I am running for the Board of Supervisors because we need to start making positive and forward-thinking changes now. Frederick County is one of the fastest-growing and most desirable counties in Virginia. The countys population is expected to grow 30 percent in the next 20 years  from 90000 to 117000. We need people with the vision to prepare our county for this expansion in business education and infrastructure. We cannot have people in power who follow their own agendas or do not have the necessary experience to lead  people who tell us Thats how it has always been done. We need leaders with vision leadership capabilities and proven experience.  Since moving here seven years ago I have been involved with:   Educationworking for Head Start on several committees with the Winchester and Frederick County public school systems and on the development team for Inspire 2025 a strategic plan for FCPS.  Businessserving as CEO of the Top of Virginia Regional Chamber of Commerce working with over 800 members to assist in growing their businesses and developing relationships with senior leadership and small business owners and serving on the Virginia State Board of Directors for Chamber of Commerce Executives.  Communityworking extensively with a number of non-profits. While on the Blue Ridge Hospice Board I was appointed interim CEO where I served for a year and a half navigating the impact of the COVID pandemic. I also serve on the steering committee of the Non-Profit Alliance of the Shenandoah Valley was recently elected to the Board of Directors of the Community Foundation of the Northern Shenandoah Valley and have participated on several Shenandoah University committees.  I could have chosen to run for the Frederick County Board of Supervisors as an Independent but the Democratic party ideas most closely align with my own values. As such Im running as a moderate Democrat striving to reach Independents and moderate Republicans. I believe in the 2nd Amendment for all Americans which protects the right to gun ownership but I also believe that there should be common-sense laws regulating high-powered military-style weapons. I believe in equality and opportunity for all people and in protecting the rights for people of all races religions and genders in our community. I believe in the availability of healthcare for all and private insurance as an option. I believe in investing in our schools and community for high quality education for our children with supporting infrastructure such as housing broadband and transportation. I believe in promoting business growth to elevate incomes for our families financed in such a way that it provides a fair and equitable return on our investment. If you agree with me that it is time for a sensible change on the Frederick County Board of Supervisorstime for leaders with the vision to take us into the futureI hope you will support my campaign with a donation or your volunteer support. And I thank you for your encouragement.  PS: As we prepare to mark the 20th anniversary of the terrible attacks of 9/11 I know you join me in acknowledging and thanking our own first responders and others who bravely put their lives on the line every day.

A Green New Deal has become a charged term where some people fear that airplanes and cars will be banned because of considerable disinformation from certain political pockets. A Maine Green Deal New Green Deal Maine Compact for Clean Energy: Call it what you will but here is what I support. The conversion of the former Maine Yankee to a facility capable of transferring 156 GW of energy developed by offshore wind turbines would in itself create thousands of jobs and make Maine 100% powered by clean energy by 2030. Investing in solar for housing would create thousands of jobs. Also important in the effort to reduce emissions is to incentivize the sale and purchases of electric- or hybrid-powered personal vehicles and the development of a statewide infrastructure of electric charging stations to make mobility by electric power accessible and practical. These are all solutions that would help us achieve the goals of emission reduction and 100% clean energy as well as create thousands of jobs that will stimulate Maine's economy. In turn Maine's reputation as an environmental leader will bolster and increase environmental tourism in the state also improving our economy. The environment is our economic stimulus post-Covid. We have the ability to both do good on the environment AND jumpstart a new economy all in one fell swoop if our government is able to keep up with the will of the people.  *Benjamin Meiklejohn is endorsed by .,political,Facebook
"An American Nationalist Voting Index - The Square Deal  This is part of a series examining the issues in the presidential election. To see other articles in the series visit the website version of this article cited below and click on the 2020 Elections tab on the Home page.  Score Biden-.5 Trump +2  Roosevelts commitment to the working man was born of two incidents of violence in his life that challenged his fundamentally conservative impulses. The first was the assassination of President William McKinley by an anarchist which led to Roosevelts succession to the presidency. The anarchists were the Antifa/Islamic terrorists of their time and arose out of the economic inequality and discontent that were byproducts of the Industrial Revolution. The second was his service with the Rough Riders in the Spanish-American war. TR saw bravery in both poor Cowboys and privileged Northeast elite in the charge up San Juan Hill and believed their government owed them a square deal for that bravery which he defined as follows:  ""But when I say am for the square deal I mean not merely that I stand for fair play under the present rules of the game but that I stand for having those rules changed so as to work for a more substantial equality of opportunity and of reward for equally good service.""  At the same time he expected the average worker to respond by contributing to his family community and country not simply demanding a handout from the government.  In todays economy we need to change the rules on economic concentration trade and immigration to give American workers a real chance to achieve the American Dream of stable and independent financial security. Biden and Trump have verifiable records with successes and failures on these issues.  Antitrust Law  The abuses of Big Tech have revived interest in antitrust policy and exposed its deficiencies in todays world economy. The problem lies in the fact we are still trying to regulate these 21st century monopolies using 19th century laws. We learned in the 2008 financial crisis that allowing companies to become too big to fail created a new form of monopoly rents by allowing elites to privatize profits while socializing their risk of loss. Meanwhile Big Tech was finding new ways to leverage customer data to monopolize the Internet advertising and product sales market.  The Trump Administrations challenge to the ATT-Time Warner merger attempted to build a case against bigness itself by attacking vertical mergers. Unfortunately the DC circuit Court of Appeals upheld the merger on the grounds it created useful efficiencies which completely misses the point. They also recently filed a lawsuit against Google over their use of their monopoly power over Internet searches to raise advertising prices. However they have failed to pursue modernization of the antitrust laws themselves Despite this failure these two innovative suits earn Trump a + .5.  The Obama Administration also had an active antitrust docket and challenged several mergers with limited success. The losses in both the Obama and Trump Administrations emphasize the need for a modernization of the rules. The Democratic House also just released a comprehensive report on Big Techs abuses of their market power that could serve as a start for a re-tooling of the statutes. All of this suggests Biden should be given a +.5 on the issue as well.  Trade  Protecting America and its workers from unfair international trade practices has been an area where the Trump Administration has shined. They understood the importance of a strong manufacturing sector and have not subjugated American policy to the slow and sometimes hostile mechanisms of the World Trade Organization. Alan Tonelson of RealityChek has pointed out that the tariffs against China and others have not prevented the manufacturing sector form succeeding during the pandemic without a loss of jobs (see his post from October 19). At the same time the administration preserved the strategically important partnership between the US Canada & Mexico by concluding the U.S.- Mexico-Canada Agreement. Trump deserves a +1 for these achievements.  Bidens record and positions are almost the polar opposite. He wants to return to the multilateral approach ignoring Americas unique great power interest in preserving its internal economic strength. However he has also said he would relax the Chinese tariffs gradually and only upon concessions from the Chinese. Biden says he would prioritize developing an international coalition to challenge Chinese state capitalism as well. The latter positions reduce his negative score to a -.5.  Immigration  Trumps actions to restrict illegal immigration have been divisive haphazard and often poorly justified on ethnic nationalist grounds. However they have changed the dynamic and started to limit the use of immigrant workers to compete with Americans (see my post Immigration  The New Slavery). However Trump failed to seize the opportunity to pass comprehensive immigration legislation when he had a Republican Congress. Because of this failure he deserves only a +.5 on the issue.  Biden and the Democrats have understandably concentrated on the necessity of legalizing immigrants that have been here for years. They then oppose any real future controls on immigration and would expand the number of HIVB-style visas thus allowing big companies to use foreign workers to continue to pay substandard wages. As a result they deserve a -.5 on this issue.  Conclusion  Many other changes in the rules of the game are necessary to give American workers the economic opportunities they deserve. Mere income redistribution is not enough. Americans simply want their government to give them a fair chance to compete and contribute; in short the square deal that TR believed in and for which he fought.

Abraham Lincoln said it best that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth . Many politicians have never had to work multiple jobs to keep a roof over their families head or owned a small business where you worked from 7am to midnight just to keep the doors open. Over the years we have heard promises to help the people but at the same time it is just false promises to get them elected. Its time we change that we need true representation of the residents of Michigan.,political,Facebook
"Due to the continuing impact of Covid-19 with the economic impact on jobs income and earnings it is becoming increasingly more obvious (and extremely important) that wage-earners develop survival strategies to protect themselves and their own families!  While everyday income taxpayers continue working feverishly to earn a living wage it only adds to the stress and pressure knowing that between January 1 and December 31 of every NEW year portions of YOUR hard-earned paychecks are taken away to pay income taxes BEFORE you receive the reward from your own paycheck!  In fact the money that SHOULD be working for YOUR family is collected and withheld BY LAW from your use until AFTER you file an income tax return...in the FOLLOWING year!  Even then YOU are REQUIRED to file a tax return to determine whether you OVERPAID (a REFUND is due) or UNDER PAID (more money is DUE) for the PREVIOUS year!  Even WORSEyour payments were made to provide the GUARANTEED salaries for the WEALTHY politicians and officials that YOU elected to represent you and fill YOUR needs in federalstate and local organizations and governments!  If you would like to receive information to reverse this situation and put yourself back in the driver's seat then it's perhaps time that we begin discussions regarding a process that can liberate you from this LEARNED process to which you were introduced early in your working career!

Hello Gibsonburg Parents Taxpayers and Voters.  We are just a few days away from making a very important decision for our schools and our children. We will have to make the choice to vote for three of the four candidates running for the Gibsonburg School Board.  The last few years we have seen how our schools are run and how concerns and issues are taken care of by our current school board and administration. I have watched as parents have been ignored. I have watched and seen parents be shut down and told time is up to speak just because the current board doesnt want to hear anymore from them. This is not ok! This shouldnt be taking place period!  We as a whole have been concentrating on the mask and vaccination issues facing us and our children all the while it has taken the focus off of the educational issues that face our schools. Over the last several years Gibsonburg Schools have slipped further behind on their grade from the state. Though a positive is no grades were given the last two years so that has helped. This is on the Gibsonburg School Board. Everything starts and stops with them and it seems as if that has been forgotten and the blame just keeps getting tossed around. We need a School Board who will step up and take responsibility for the issues of our district. Though its obvious that only two of them Mason and Mendoza will do so. These two Gibsonburg School Board members spoke up and admitted that they dropped the ball on distance learning for when kids were quarantined. The others took no responsibility for this and this has been a trend for some time. If we dont have a board that can stand up and admit they have failed in areas then they are not who we need and its time to make that change that is needed for the sake of our kids education.  We have to have people on the Gibsonburg School Board who will take the time to listen. Who will take the time to look into the issues that are brought to them. We need a Gibsonburg School Board who will welcome questions and not hide behind this is not a question and answer time in the meetings. We will not get anywhere if we dont have a board that will listen and answer questions and concerns that are brought before them.  I am outspoken and I speak my mind. Though I will also give you the respect that you deserve to speak yours and ask questions. I dont believe that a parent who is being passionate with their words as being a threat or disrespectful. They are fighting for their children.  With this upcoming election on November 2nd we have to make the right choice for our children. This Gibsonburg School Board will be the one who will be hiring the next Superintendent of our schools. This is a very important decision that will affect our Gibsonburg Schools for many years possibly. If we get this wrong then its our children who will pay the price. This person has to be the go between for the teachers and staff and the School Board. This is a time consuming decision I know and I am willing to take that time as this is so very important for the future of our childrens education.  There is much to do with policy that is out of date and doesnt reflect the times that we are living in. This also is a time consuming issue that has to be done for our children. The Gibsonburg School Board needs to take the time to sit down and go over the entire curriculum for each grade level and see exactly whats in it. Though this needs to be an effort that includes the teachers and administration as well as the board. We have to start finding the solutions to why our grades are slipping and come up with a much needed plan to fix it.  Gibsonburg was once the most sought after school district. Gibsonburg was the district that members from local communities as well as educators would recommend as one of the best around and sadly we have lost this. I for one want to get back to this. We have let our schools be turned into just a business instead of a place to build the future of our children and it has to stop. Those kids arent just dollar signs they are our future.  As a parent of two children who attend our schools I am fighting for them. I am fighting for their friends and the other parents. Those that have run before or who have been on the board or even the Gibsonburg Council knows that these are thankless jobs. Though with knowing this I have still chosen to run and keep fighting because all of OUR children are worth everything I have to help make their education the best it can be along with everyones input and concerns.  Believe it or not GIBSONBURG SCHOOLS are what makes our community what it is. Without our Gibsonburg Schools our community wouldnt be what it is. Gibsonburg Schools are so very important and so vital to this community and if we were to ever lose them it would be tragic.  We need to get this right on November 2nd. We have to vote for the candidates who will leave parental rights in the hands of the parents and will strive to work with all on the education of our children.  Vote Justin Chafin for Gibsonburg School Board on November 2nd.  OUR CHILDREN OUR COMMUNITY OUR FUTURE,political,Facebook
Over the next four years my plan is focusing on Economic Development here in Newton by helping our existing companies grow expand and provide the friendly environment needed which will attract new business and grow our tax base. By doing this we can continue to keep our taxes flat without increases. I've been part of getting Occidental Management to move forward with their project south of Walmart Park Aerospace doubling their facility at the airport a new Freddy's opening in town and now a manufacturing company GAF who is going through the process of purchasing 230 acres at the Kansas Logistics Park with a strong possibility of new jobs. I have the ability to build consensus and make things happen for Newton. All these things I've mentioned and the direction we're headed make Newton an attractive place to live.

"Hello Everyone It's been a very long haul this past year. So many new burdens in our lives. Many have lost their jobs and need food. No money for bills etc. Many have lost family members to this horrible Covid-19. Everyone is under some type of quarantine. Churches in many states are closed by Gov. Officials We need God in our lives. Without God we are lost. Thank God for our Bibles for His word will keep us connected.  When something goes wrong in our lives the first thing people do is to call out ""Oh God"" though some haven't spoken to God since the last problem in their lives. And then they wonder why their life is in such a mess.  Lets take a look at this. Do you ignore the fact that God is your HOLY Father? He made you thru the creation of MAN. Yet you ignore him. You don't understand Him? You don't have time for Him? Is it the sin in your life that keep you from having a relationship with him. Dirty nasty filthy obscene sin? Be honest with yourself! Are you a sinner who only speaks to God when you need Him? Or you just use His Name as an expression of anger shock value etc.  OK let me continue on with God's message. Christmas is only weeks away. All of us Christians will celebrate The Birth of Christ by adorning our Christmas trees with decorations love and song. We will Worship God for the Love He has for that He gave His Only Begotten Son to death for our sins. ONCE and FOR ALL! Cleansed of all sin. Some may disregard asking why? how? But never go further in their lives to find out the answers.  He is the Son of God. He is our Shepherd. He is our Messiah. He is our SAVIOR!!!! He was born to die for our sins. So that we might not perish but have everlasting life. John 3:16  He is our Shepherd and He loves us. He is always as close away as a breath a whisper. Speak His Name "" JESUS "" and you can be assured that He hears you!  Lastly I want to remind you what Jesus told the people ""When you pray to the Father for things you need. Believe and you shall receive. Thanking your Father "" In Jesus Name ""....Amen ""  Have Faith my friends like the woman with the issue of Blood Mark 5:22 Romans 10:17 Hebrew 11:1 Hebrew 11:1-6  The Only one who can satisfy the heart is the One who made it God Bless you all Barbara Green",political,Facebook
As a former Marine I was trained God Country and Corps. Of course family however Im watching our country being torn to shreds. My blood boils as countless elites stand by and do absolutely nothing. They send our jobs overseas they kill our country for the sake of lining their own pockets. Then have the nerve to treat our great brothers and sisters worse then POWS. I am deeply saddened that instead of taking care of our own problems they would rather help other countries with theirs. I have yet to see any other country step up to our door step and lend us a helping hand probably never will. Now our leader is allowing millions of people who are undocumented to walk right in and let them be apart of this great nation. All for the sake of a vote.

Envirolink was a repeated topic at last night's debate. Here are a few things / questions that have stuck with me regarding the topic.  Envirolink needs to be held accountable. The new contract being negotiated by the sitting board will take affect in 2022 and will have a lot to do with how effectively that can be done.  How will the current sitting Board hold them accountable? Will they be here to see work being done incorrectly while it is being done? Are they counting on the Citizens of Spring Hope to fill them in once a month? Saying you will hold them accountable has to have a plan. If nothing changes as far as the Board's time spent on the issues a contract change will only minimize the issues with Enviorlink.  Will the new contract allow Envirolink to hold the Spring Hope hostage for another 5 years?  Has a cost analysis on gradually removing services from Envirolink already been done? In not why not? If so what were the results?  You have choice. Are you happy with the current Board? If not you have myself and another candidate that has the ability and wants to take this on pretty much full time. As the current Board has said multiple times in the past they have full time jobs.  Part time solutions is not going to solve full time problems.  The choice is yours and you have the power to start change in Spring Hope...VOTE!,political,Facebook
"Friends  the Leesburg Patch asked all candidates to respond to the same questions and they also allowed candidates to skip questions and give no response. The following are the questions I responded to and my opponent decided not to answer.  My opponent also falsely states that I have no active campaign and that I signed a pledge not to run. The pledge I signed was contingent upon a fair and open endorsement process which it was not and the approval of my membership in the Loudoun County Democratic Committee which was rejected. I received a refund of my membership fee which removed me from all previous obligations to this organization.  1. Do you support Black Lives Matter and what are your thoughts on the demonstrations held since the death of George Floyd and the shooting of Jacob Blake?  I started Citizens for a Better Leesburg as a Facebook Community and in May after the George Floyd murder and I organized what turned out to be the largest Loudoun County peaceful demonstration of citizen engagement. this event showcased the peaceful outrage and show of sympathy for the Floyd family. I am not afraid to use my leadership platform to help our diverse communities as they wrestle with local and national issues that we cannot ignore. I have always supported the constitutional rights and protections for all American Citizens. And when at times the arbitrary and disproportionate treatment of Americans of African descent results in violence and death it is time to speak out and that's what the over 2500 people who came to Leesburg on May 31st wanted us to hear Black Lives Matter and no more. They came as individuals as families with children in strollers they came as friends and school communities they came to take a stand against law enforcement violence taking the lives of black men and women.  2. What are your thoughts on the campaign to ""defund"" the police? In Leesburg we have been historically underfunded the police department because of partisan fears of raising taxes. I am leading the initiative with members of our community to have an open conversation with the Chief of Police related to some of the national issues and local concerns. As our Town has grown we are also experiencing the challenges of paying for additional police and improving our safety and emergency response operations. I believe that it is time for us to be open to recommendations about what law enforcement services we need and how to pay for them. Moving forward the culture and impact of working with our law enforcement officers in our town will look and feel different than in other communities and our citizens should have a role in the process. The funding for law enforcement services will and should continue. It is my hope to engage our community to work with law enforcement to review our policies and explore the opportunities for citizen involvement and building safe communities for all.  3. What are your thoughts on the state and national response to the coronavirus pandemic? Do you favor such measures as limiting operation of non-essential businesses or restricting indoor/outdoor dining? And do you favor a nationwide mask mandate? We are in state of national emergency and the impacts have been devastating on the tremendous loss of life and changes to our daily way of life. I believe in the science and the recommendations to keep the virus under control. I believe that the statewide restrictions has a disproportionate impact on each community but I support the restrictions and don't see them as limiting our freedoms. I believe in mask wearing hand sanitizing and social distancing to protect ourselves others family and friends. Mask wearing is the only way we will ever get back to the freedom of not wearing a mask until we get the full impact of a vaccine. My children and grandchildren have had limited our exposure to each other. My wife and I have experienced the virtual HS graduation of a grandson and missed birthdays of aging parents. Our unity as a community must be focused on doing all that we can.  4. What are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post? I have the proven leadership and financial experience that is critically necessary at this time. I have the ability to develop partnerships without regards to political party affiliation and use all of our common strengths to create a working environment of respect. I am a passionate community organizer who volunteers and works with many of our diverse community organizations and can engage them as important stakeholders. I believe that job accountability is important as our community make the important decision about to who to vote for as Mayor. I am not leaning on political party support or the usual marketing techniques to get your attention or your vote. I continually inform the community about the decisions I make and I am not afraid to object on issues where I believe don't serve the best interests of our community. I have made strong efforts to work in a nonpartisan fashion and will continue to be inclusive of all voices in our community. I know how to lead difficult conversations and resolve complex problems.  5. If you are a challenger in what way has the current board or officeholder failed the community (or district or constituency) I am running for Mayor of Leesburg because the challenges that face our community require new leadership that has the ability and the experience to step outside of the partisan circle to lead conversations on important topics such as the economic recovery plan for the town and our small businesses. The impacts of COVID-19 are a critical top priority that must be addressed. It is estimated that we will lose 25% of our current small businesses. I plan to lead the Council in the development of a five- year recovery plan to prioritize the budget impacts and take action on solutions to provide services to our residents and our small businesses. The business community involvement in this plan is critical to the financial success of the town and provide for new innovative concepts to stimulate small business growth. My educational background and professional leadership roles have given me the experience that is critically necessary to support the challenges facing the town. In my four years on Council I have developed partnerships without regards to political party affiliation and as a leader I know how to use all of our common strengths to work towards serving all in our town. I am a principled leader that will work with all elected members of the Town Council and will assure you that all members of our community will be treated with fairness and respect. I believe in people over politics and pledge to always put the best interest of our town first.  6. What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job? I have built many business partnerships that have delivered economic and social value for public and private institutions and organizations. I have worked with diverse communities to help organize programs and presentations that add value to their voices. I spoken in front of public and private forums in the U.S. and in five foreign countries. I can handle the political pressure and remain true to my integrity and commitment to serve the town. I have had to make difficult business decisions about outsourcing jobs affecting the lives of thousands of food service workers and I was able to achieve an innovative outcome that was applauded by the labor unions representing the workers. We outsourced management and kept the workers as university employees. I have learned that many things are possible with the right team and an open mind to seek creative solutions.  7. What are your views on fiscal policy government spending and the use of taxpayer dollars in the office you are seeking? The Council has an important oversight responsibility to ensure that public funds and spent appropriately and that the budget priorities reflect a spending plan that support services and programs to benefit the entire community and keep tax rates that maintain an affordable quality of life for all in our community. The new council must prepare itself to quickly learn about the fiscal challenges and the fiscal obligations that have been built into the current budget that have been mostly covered by residential and business tax revenues. I will propose additional council budget orientation sessions that will focus on the learning about the fiscal deficit and potential solutions that might involve reductions in staff and/or services. This fiscal deficit cannot be resolved by increasing taxes on an already fiscally stressed community. Additional revenue support will be hard to find and no new support will be coming from the county or the state and we will need to have serious conversations with the town's financial advisers about how to best use reserve funds while we are in the recovery period.  8. What else would you like voters to know about yourself and your positions? I will bring a non-adversarial approach to the Town Council and seek to respect all council members as we debate and make important town decisions. I intend to get support for a planning retreat with the town staff and our commision leadership so that we can all set agendas that reflect the town priorities. I love Leesburg and the many great communities that we have. I want our town to reflect our strengths and a positive future as we move forward in uncertain fiscal times. I have the professional business and leadership experience to move us forward.  Time to make a change in leadership for the future of Leesburg is now.",political,Facebook
DAVID CLARK FOR CITY COUNCIL  Bloomington MN City Council District #3  PRESS RELEASE  October 27th 2021  *For Immediate Release*  ****************************************************  I just learned that the City of Bloomington will fire fifteen police officers who are refusing for private personal reasons to take the COVID-19 vaccine.  Many of our police officers have already had COVID and have thus built up natural resistance to COVID. Natural resistance is almost always more effective than vaccine-induced resistance. Why should these officers have to get vaccinated?  Our police wear masks and are aware of their surroundings when dealing with other people. The vaccine primarily protects the individual taking it. It does not prevent the spread of the disease. An officer refusing vaccination is taking a personal risk but is not putting others at significant risk.  Therefore any mandate (Federal or otherwise) that results in the loss of employment over this issue is a violation of the rights of each individual to make choices about their bodies and their medical treatment. The rule My body my choice should apply here.  This is just one more example of the erosion of individual rights and civil liberties in Bloomington over the past year. We have seen grown adults lose their right to make choices on the purchase of flavored tobacco products. Homeowners have lost their rights with arbitrary zoning changes with no regard for local input.  For over a year our self-righteous Mayor and some City Council members have consistently defaulted to a position of restricting individual rights when they have the chance. Courts have intervened and found in favor of Plaintiffs in two such cases now: trash collection practices and the Councils unconstitutional decision to ban some photography in public parks which could still cost Bloomington tens of thousands of dollars in attorney-fee awards to the person who sued - two more examples of a City eager to restrict the rights of its residents even in cases our courts have said are un-constitutional.  With this latest salvo the City is once again coming down on the side of telling our police officers what is best for their bodies. Those who are comfortable taking the vaccine have every right to do so and should.  But I stand firmly with those police who are not comfortable being vaccinated whether because of their natural immunity religious concerns or for medical reasons or just the desire as an individual to not take it. I believe Police have the same rights to individual choice as all citizens. They should not lose their jobs for exercising that right. It may even be that the union contract with our police doesnt allow this sort of restriction  has the City checked? Did they consult with the Union?  This isnt just a medical freedom issue. It is a public safety issue. Police Chief Mike Hartley reported to the City Council in the October 25ty meeting that crime is on the rise in Bloomington. We need every police officer we can get. We are already short officers. Firing fifteen more out of around 125 officers* - about 12% of the total force - for bad reasons makes the staffing situation in Bloomington much worse puts more load on remaining officers will cause a plunge in police morale and decrease safety for all of us.  That is unacceptable and I will not stay silent about my support for our police on these issues and for their vital role in our community.

"It's Time To Vote. Vote YES on Measure 18-120  If you haven't voted it's time to vote and a YES vote on 18-120 is a vote for moving Klamath County forward.  Klamath's time is now. The Community is moving ahead. Some will complain then won't do anything. You can do something to help: Vote YES.  Consider the facts:  1) Klamath's Visitor-Paid Lodging Fees are extremely low at just 8.0% while virtually everywhere else is 30% to 50% higher (or more). Fees elsewhere are 11.0% and up.  2) Travelers do not consider lodging fees or local taxes in their decision to travel or where to travel. These fees are expected.  3) Lodging businesses are paid by the County to collect and remit these visitor-paid fees back to the County. And while some Budget motels are voicing concern about this measure they will be the first to benefit by the increase in visitation as a result of Measure 18-120.  4) The travel tourism and hospitality segment in Klamath employs over 4000 people and tourism revenues into Klamath County amount to over $384mm annually making it one of the largest economic engines in our area. It was also one of the hardest hit over the past year.  5) If you and your friends and family enjoy use or appreciate ANY of the following you are directly or indirectly benefitting from visitor-paid lodging fees: why then would you not vote or vote against Measure 18-120 which ultimately brings more lodging fee revenues to the following:  The Fairgrounds The Klamath County Museums The Favell Museum The City of Klamath Falls Crater Lake - Klamath Falls Regional Airport City Parks & Recreation Trail Systems - including Spence Mountain and others Tourism Grant Program Klamath County Visitor's Bureau Events: Kruise of Klamath Winter Wings Festival Basin Brew & Q and many others Steen Sports Park The Ross Ragland Theater Klamath Film & The Klamath Independent Film Festival  All the above and dozens more organizations events venues and activities receive a portion of their funding from - you guessed it - Visitor-paid lodging fees.  Some people on this FB page are ""Anti Tax"". We get it. But if we want a community with amenities and benefits there's a cost. And that cost can be paid-for by locals through higher property taxes business taxes or other levies. Do you know Ashland funds a portion of its community development by charging everyone 5% on every restaurant meal? We don't do that here. But we are asking Klamath's voters to support and approve a small lift in hotel/motel fees that visitors to our county pay.  Some have called out our elected officials for not saying where every penny will go which is unfair because state law dictates where at least 70% must go leaving up to 30% open and available to apply where it can do the most good for our community. The Commissioners have pledged to discuss how those discretionary dollars are allocated and let's trust our elected officials to do the right thing.  Klamath has a bright future. It has a National Park System unit on either side of Klamath Falls and 800000 a year visit those Parks leaving nearly $100mm behind annually when they leave. These funds support jobs businesses and communities throughout Klamath County.  Finally the following have evaluated debated and reached the conclusion this measure is good for Klamath:  Klamath County Chamber of Commerce Klamath County Economic Development Association Discover Klamath Visitor & Convention Bureau Klamath County Association of Realtors The Board of Commissioners Klamath County Travel Southern Oregon The Mayor Councilmen and Councilwomen of Klamath Falls Klamath Falls Downtown Association  And many leading businesses community leaders and citizens.

To most Certificate of Needs (CON) is probably something of which youve never heard. This is the one thing that prevents medical facilities from locating in certain areas of WV and creating value competition. We always encourage businesses to relocate to this great state so why are we not doing that with healthcare? To say there are plenty of jobs for those opposing a mandate may be true- but those jobs are not in WV and not in the areas where captive healthcare facilities have a stronghold. We need to eliminate the CON for our healthcare professionals to be able to choose freely where they want to work and for our citizens to ensure they are provided with the best available services. Even the best organizations around are only as good as the freedoms they promote. Otherwise this state will continue to loose our hardworking citizens.,political,Facebook

ECONOMIC RECOVERY POST-COVID The solutions of economic recovery are lying right under our noses with knowledge expertise technology and research all present right here in Maine. The solutions all lead straight back to impeccable environmental stewardship. At our own flagship university the University of Maine the Advanced Structures and Composites Center has engineered composite floating offshore wind turbine hulls which could produce 156 gigawatts of energy per year within 10 years -- more than $20 million of annual revenue at today's market value free energy to Maine residents (through tax rebates or possibly a dividend disbursement similar to the Alaska Permanent Fund) and thousands of new jobs. A Katahdin North Woods National Park would result in more than $100 million per year injected into Maine's economy and up to 6000 new jobs in the first 10 years 10000 in the first 20. In a post-Covid-19 world the environment will be an even greater tourism and recreation attraction than ever before. Maine is poised -- so long as there is political will -- to benefit economically from its greatest asset our environment. What's the hold up Democrats and Republicans?,political,Facebook
"MODERN MONETARY THEORY: MISREPRESENTED ONCE AGAIN  Recently on a Bloomberg financial podcast an executive level employee at J.P. Morgan stated he did not believe in Modern Monetary Theory (MMT). MMT is a controversial monetary theory which offers a description of monetary operations which challenge orthodox economic and financial thinking. Within current MMT reasoning there is a belief there is room for fiscal expansion which when coordinated with the Nation's central bank--the Federal Reserve (FED) will enable public investment in human and physical capital i.e. infrastructure without inflationary consequences. The J.P. Morgan executive argued that in order for MMT to succeed that it would also have to fail: that to accumulate the debt which he implies is acceptable to MMT for public investment then even if the investment proved good for the economy the accumulated debt would then tank the economy.  It was the strangest comment that one could expect from an investment banker and it also misrepresented MMT views. First from an investment banker perspective it is strange to state that debt issuance condemns an institution to failure. Bankers afterall are peddlers of private sector debt issued on the belief that the gains from private investment will generally exceed the cost of capital. Government debt issued in order to facilitate productive investment: physical and human likewise has the potential to create long term gains in the economy which exceed the cost of capital. So it was strange to hear an investment banker ignore the growth potential associated with public debt issuance which finances physical and human capital investment: the type of investment promoted within the MMT framework.  The MMT public sector investment portfolio would include such things as green energy investment in education and most importantly a federal job guarantee program which would offer a job to anyone who seeks a job at a livable wage with health and child care benefits--a near full employment program.  A legitimate concern here should not be the level of debt so long as the associated funds are directed into productive investment but the concern should be the potential inflationary impact of large scale investment which creates individual earnings not yet matched by an increase in the provision of consumer goods and services. The temporary mismatch between increased earnings from new investment and the availability of goods and services may create short to medium term inflationary pressures in these consumer markets. One market concern undoubtedly is the belief that once inflation begins it feeds on itself into an upward spiral of increased inflationary pressure which can only be resolved through monetary and fiscal tightenings i.e. an induced recession.  It is not clear to me whether MMT has adequately addressed the short term inflationary impact of broad public infrastructure investment. MMT definitely recognizes that Federal spending is limited by potential inflationary effects of Federal spending and it seems they differ from the broader market participants in their view of the size and scope of available resources which can be put to work before real resource restraints create inflationary pressure. In other words it seems that MMT believes there currently exists greater slack in the economy than the broader market participants believe and it also seems that MMT believes that increased productive capacity which meets consumer demand can come online rather quickly in order to thwart these inflationary pressures. The latter view is undoubtedly challenged in a trade restricted environment.  It appears that MMT takes the long view and the bigger point is that green energy will eventually be a more efficient source of energy while high tech education combined with liberal arts training will make us both more productive and better citizens. The federal jobs programs will assist in the development of work skills which will further enhance national productivity. Debt used to finance such activity would be a very good use of debt and will not inflict damage on the national economy but rather will enhance long term growth in a noninflationary manner.  Much of the above discussion is premised on a misrepresentation of the MMT view on public debt. The J.P. Morgan Executive's view is premised on the idea that Federal deficit spending must be funded with debt. This is not the MMT view. Federal debt issuance is a policy option not a requirement for deficit spending.  The MMT view is that a sovereign monetary authority such as the U.S. which creates its own free floating currency creates money when it spends and destroys money through taxation and borrowing. Money creation and money destruction need not be equal. Spending need not be fully funded but only 'funded' to an extent and in a manner which prevents inflation in the goods services and asset markets. In other words deficit spending need not be funded with debt: the money for deficit spending is created through the act of spending. An equivalent debt issuance merely destroys an equal amount of money thereby neutralizing any inflationary impact of the deficit spending. Debt issuance money destruction is a mere tool for inflation control and for other convenient purposes i.e. private portfolio investment stability store of value interest rate targeting . . . .  Furthermore the Executive's narrative ignored debt management techniques discussed elsewhere on this Page (""Federal Debt Revisited"" scroll 5 essays down) such as debt extinguishment the Platinum coin idea which grew out of the 2011 budget ceiling crisis taxation of the well-off rather than borrowing from the well-off and Federal Reserve perpetual holdings of Treasury debt on its balance sheet--which is costless to the U.S. taxpayer. The brief discussion of MMT was yet another false representation of MMT views.  Generally it is wise to dismiss about 85% of corporate reporting on MMT views. Most commentators have not seriously examined MMT; others are in no mood to change the status quo. Large capital interests in the private sector simply do not want to concede additional space to the public sector regardless of the long term growth potential associated with public sector investment.  Undoubtedly the Nation's long term productivity potential would be greatly enhanced by the above public sector investments. But in the long run the current investment class won't be here. Perhaps this is part of the problem. The other part lies in the short term investment horizon of private sector firms responding to investor demands for short term profits which overall does not align with the long term investment objectives of the Federal government.

The Wedge  Im proudly a child of the 80s. The music was great fashion not so great and the Cold War was still present but a far cry from the Cuban Missile Crisis of the 1960s. We as a nation by and large recognized ourselves as part of an American family so to speak and the world as it were seemed safe. Whether you loved him or hated him The Reagan principle of Peace through Strength kept the world on as even of a keel as one could ask for. I played after school incessantly with my friends and we had a favorite game called War. The rules were simple as one might imagine each kid brought his biggest and best toy guns and we played for hours a breed of hide n seek only with weapons. To my knowledge none of my former playmates to this day have ever been involved in a mass shooting. Looking through the prism of history it was a glorious time where for once the old divisions did not seem to matter anymore. Minorities and women had ascended to some of the highest levels of leadership and industry and as a rule the term race and racism seemed to be remnants of a bygone era. Today there exist a wedge that has been driven like a wooden stake straight through the heart of this country. It has pitted us against each other in a way that I personally never thought we could develop into. It is though we have been separated and resegregated based on characteristics that run antithetical to everything the Civil Rights Movement stood for. What is the wedge exactly and more importantly how did we get here? To have an honest discussion about this topic we must all concede that leaders no matter what their stripes have the ability to be polarizing. I categorize two types of polarizing figures. There are those that are polarizing for the right reasons and those that divide for every reason that is wrong. For example Ben Shapiro in my opinion a polarizing figure for the right reasons. He makes honest fair assessments of situations in a time where for some reason this is looked upon as divisive hate speech even white supremacy which is remarkably interesting when you take into account that Ben Shapiro is an Orthodox Jew. Then you have the Linda Sarsars of the world whose rhetoric and speech are not only hateful but backed up in no way by fact or reason. As we all know Ben Shapiro should not be a polarizing figure but is because the time of real true free speech is over. Stereotypes as well have made a huge return only now the focus seems to be on mainly white America. If we are to have a true discussion we must be honest. Is there any other ethnicity in America today that is subjected to the level of sensitivity training and whatever else they can think of to somehow make white people feel bad about themselves? If that kind of action were perpetrated on any other ethnic group in this country it would be a return to slave days I guess Im not sure where you really go once youve played the Jim Crow Card. The leadership in Washington though divided by obvious ideological differences are all capable of injecting themselves into situations where it is not needed or make a bone headed statement that only serves to fan the flames of whatever the divide may be. In the years since the 80s and leading into the modern times the division has come at the hands of neo-progressives who seek to silence any opinion that might challenge their deeply held beliefs. Notice I did not say the left because quite frankly I grew up side by side with the left and the right but this new breed of ultra-left thinkers have somehow managed to find a way to completely dominate the narrative in this nation. Perhaps even worse though the ugly specter of racism has returned but it is a form of racism that is by and large imagined and always rooted in suppositions that just do not make any sense. The United States in many ways is comparable to a High School. Where there is an endless number of cliques each convinced of their superior thought and superior ideas. What has come to pass as a superior idea in contemporary society can be as simple as a completely reality detached statement made by someone paid millions of dollars to play a game. Nothing on its face seems to make much sense anymore. Its as though every positive statement about America has a but. We are a compassionate and generous nation but we are systemically racist internally. Millions of people from all over the world dream of making it to our shores but we are an extremely oppressive society especially with those that are different from us. Of course you receive the same chorus of statements that get more to the point. America is driven by white supremacy. America is and always has been about inequality. With the presence of such inane and blanket statements where does anyone find any common ground? When one makes a blanket statement about an entire race of people how do you approach that person and try to have a dialogue to try and better understand why it is they feel this way. With the actions of the past year getting a man on the street opinion might get you beat up. It is like we are all out to get each other but for what. Does Black America really believe that myself and millions just like me hate them and think that somehow they are less than in my eyes. It is a proposition that sounds absolutely ludicrous and yet I guarantee you could find quite a few people who believe that. How did people in America come to think such things politics plain and simple. In the days before the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the accompanying Civil Rights Movement black Americans especially those in the south found themselves not much better off than the days that they were in bondage. Back breaking work share cropping and making barely enough to keep your family fed. This time in American history is where we witnessed a mass migration to the cities of America in search of not only jobs but a hope to escape the segregation and subhuman treatment of the deep south. In the cities there were jobs to be had and money to be made for those that possessed the entrepreneurial spirit. It seemed like a perfect formula. The only problem was is that though black America thought that the north was this place where racism somehow did not exist or at least not as bad as what they had experienced outside the city. However they would find like in all big cities people are by and large neo-phobic. As a result they saw that even though they had made the move to the city the racism and discrimination still existed. The wages were there but were usually barely enough to keep a roof over your head and food on the table. Slowly but surely the inner cities of the US became harder and harder places to live as violence and crime began to run rampant. The poverty and despair that existed back then that still to this day causes so many to think that the only way out is to turn to fast money. Pity that fast money and crime are almost synonymous with each other. In the 1960s post JFK the POTUS was a rather vile racist Im not proud to say is from my home State of Texas. Lyndon Baines Johnson was one of those Presidents whose legacy is bathed in young Americans blood and rife with racist policies that have helped more than anything to mold society into what it is today. At the time minorities in the inner cities were certainly victims and at that time I think the idea of welfare as a means to get you on your feet was not such a bad policy. Almost from the start though folks were gaming and using the system so that they could stay home all day and do whatever they wanted so long as the check kept coming every month. My paternal Grandfather of whom I am proudly his namesake passed away in 1966 leaving my Grandma to take care of herself and four kids. Though no one in the world could think of a more deserving family in need of help my Grandma refused to go on welfare. She elected instead to take a job as a Secretary and worked for almost 50 years in that field. An old friend of my Grandpa built houses and let my Grandma finance through his company and though it was hard my Dad and his three siblings never wanted for anything. My Dad told me that sometimes it annoyed him that the people on welfare made more money than his family and never lifted a finger. Welfare was meant to be a temporary fix but as LBJ knew full well it was an elaborate ruse to turn the minorities of this nation into a dependent class of citizens. Is it any wonder that crime remained even metastasized in some cases and slowly but surely the fatherless rate began to increase? The biggest cause of father absence in my humble opinion is that through welfare women did not need a man if she did not want one. Her check would still come whether her babies Daddy hung around or not. This factor plus men shirking their responsibilities and the worst scourge of all abortion have all been the perfect mixture to make folks in inner cities not only dependent but reliable in that the politicians know so long as they keep dolling the people will keep voting. The Great Society veiled in all its promise to rid the country of poverty and make racial equality the forefront of LBJs agenda. In truth he once told a staffer that if he could get his legislation passed he would Have those ni##ers voting democrat for 200 years. It was all by design to keep minorities where he and many of his fellow Democrats exactly wanted them poor and dependent in the cities. Not empowerment to be able to have access to better jobs and a chance at the American dream but in essence to completely re-enslave the inner-city minorities of this nation. One need look no further than the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina to see still how dependent people are on the government. This is the systemic racism that people speak of. Though the media has done its part to fan the flames the politicians have constantly used incidents of crime to weaponize racism against their political foes. The unholy alliance between the media and the left has served to do nothing but bring this nation to a point that I am actually afraid. Post George Floyd which was an amazing opportunity for us to unite but was immediately politicized and the anarchy that followed may never be repaired. Every time I think that we have common ground someone or some group comes in and makes it about racism though the reasons get more and more insane by the day. So much so that AOC recently lectured all of us to remind us that even Climate change is to blame for racism. I keep waiting for Rod Serling to jump out and tell me what I am seeing is not real. So far to date I am still waiting. So what is the solution? I will not cop out and say your guess is as good as mine but in reality its pretty much the truth. I can remember the Black Power movement of my generation with Public Enemy and everyone having their Sista Soljah moment. After the election of a two-term black President I had thought that maybe we were back to a time where race was not the end all be all of human existence. I keep trying to think about legislation that has already been proposed yet every time I turn around our current President is reminding me that I am inherently racist. It is utterly amazing; he knows things about me that I dont even know myself. There must be common ground though. Somewhere out there something must exist that we can all as Americans be proud of and rally behind. I have seen so many great activists try to do that very thing and have had success doing it. People like Starr Parker and the great Candace Owens come to mind. I admire their ability to look critically at the real problems in America today no matter how vile the backlash may be. I do not want to sit at the table with ANTIFA or BLM for that matter. All they do is divide us at every possible turn. I genuinely believe that with grassroots organizing most especially with faith leaders is our only chance to affect a positive change on the Wedge that constantly is hammered to drive us all further and further apart. It pains me to go through social media these days and hear almost a hope for a civil war. I know I do not want that and I believe in my heart that most Americans do not either. I have always tried to teach my children to be color blind. My wife and I must be doing something right because almost without exception my kids best friends are minorities. I truly hope and pray that maybe one day we will again be the American family where everyones opinion is protected. Where we can come together to find solutions to the problems that we have because they are hard and require us all. Our leaders are supposed to be the ones that work to unite us the most. Politics is not a service done out of responsibility so much as opportunity. So long as that is what motivates the majority of legislators nothing will change. Let us not give up though. Just like I believe that we do not need the government intruding into our lives I do not want them intruding in our differences either. The best charity and the best help has always come from citizens acting on their own. We must share this land whether we like it or not is it truly too much to hope that we can share what brings us together. It can happen. We all can affect change in our own lives. We all make the world the way it is and as has been said through history a house divided cannot stand.  The Pamphleteer,political,Facebook
Having survived an assassination attempt Saba and her family of 12 have recently made the desperate attempt to save their lives by escaping Afghanistan. They have little money and face great uncertainty. They need help from caring and willing people. Please join us. https://gofund.me/0c6ef41b  Read Sabas story here:  Assassination Attempt Colonel Saba Sahar Zaki was the highest-ranking female officer in the Special Forces of Afghans Ministry of Interior when one morning in August 2020 with her 4-year-old daughter driver and bodyguard she was brutally attacked by 3 gunmen. [See Guardian link]. Due to concerns for her security she was taken to the hospital at Bagram Joint Airbase (controlled by the U.S.) where she was treated for 4 gunshots to her stomach. My nephew a U.S. Air Force trauma nurse was part of the team of medical specialists who treated Saba. This is how I came to know Saba her husband Emal and their warm gracious family.  Trailblazer as a Taliban Target Saba has always been a powerful voice and force for womens rights. In the Special Forces Saba recruited and trained other Afghan women for military service becoming their role model and mentor. Saba has never been bashful. Her career began an actress after which she became Afghans first female film director. In an interview by the Guardian in 2012 Saba said passionately I want to show that Afghan women are capable of doing anything men can do. Impressive yes but to the Taliban it meant a death sentence. Saba has been a target for assassination ever since. A few weeks before the family escaped Afghanistan Saba was promoted to the rank of General a long-time dream but only increased the threats.  Move Toward an Uncertain Future as Refugees Threats against Saba and her family did not fade after her attack. In fact after a BBC interview with her was aired in January [see BBC link] the threat level increased. Having resisted the idea of leaving the country she loves she Emal their 5 children and 5 extended family members made the difficult decision to flee Afghanistan for a safer country in March to seek asylum. Saba asked that I not mention the asylum country as even their safety there is not assured. They told me as they finalized their plans We are making the biggest decision of our lives when we leave our homeland and become refugees and move towards an uncertain future.  They are not a wealthy family. I helped them purchase tickets for the flight from Kabul. They are starting their lives with whatever they could carry. They have applied for asylum and temporary refugee status. Life for refugees is quite difficult. Jobs are exceedingly difficult to find housing is limited and poverty is a mainstay. Together with a small group of friends and family I have committed to provide them with a very modest monthly stipend for one year. But that will not be enough.  Their Goal is to Resettle in Canada Now Saba needs our help. I am hoping to raise money for the family through the GoFundMe page I have set up. () Their goal is to resettle in either Canada or the U.S. Although the U.S. may change its stance on refugees the backlog of deserving refugees is daunting. Therefore Saba and Emal are pinning their hopes on resettlement in Canada under its private sponsorship program. As welcoming as Canada is for refugees the best estimate from experts to whom I have spoken is that it will take at least 2 years to apply for the program find sponsors and wade through the process with many other applicants.  Purpose of Fundraising for Saba and her Family If we raise $226000 in donations we will be able to fund the required deposit and legal expenses for the Canadian sponsorship program ($125000). The required deposit (computed by formula for the family of 12) is intended by the Canadian government to cover the cost of the refugees first year. Another $26000 will be needed to supplement the $10000 I have ready raised through family & friends to provide for the familys basic living expenses for up to 2.5 years while they wait in the host/asylum country for their eventual resettlement to Canada. In the meantime Saba will need another surgery to further repair the damage done to her abdomen in the attack. The healthcare system in the host/asylum country is very poor so Saba is hoping the surgery can be done outside the country at an estimated cost of $75000 (including airfare and other travel expenses for one month).  Fundraising summary: Canadian private sponsorship fees: $100000 Legal fees for sponsorship $ 25000 Living Expenses in Asylum: $ 26000 Surgery expenses: $ 75000 Total: $226000  When I first met Saba through my nephew I promised I would assist in any way I could. We need courageous women like Saba who hopes to one day continue her work for the rights of women in Afghanistan. We cannot do the things that Saba has done but we can help her and her family when she needs us. And she needs us now.  Neither Saba nor Emal can believe that strangers would even consider helping them. I have told them donors like you will not be strangers when they hear their story.,political,Facebook
"I never respected or trusted Joe Biden. He was always wrong with his domestic and foreign policies. As senator his treatment of Robert Bork and later on Justice Clarence Thomas and some other appointees of Republican presidents was always disgraceful and unconscionable ! He is a racist unintelligent corrupt politician who has abused the people for decades. He has no core beliefs and sways whichever way is advantageous for himself. He is a flip flop charlatan with no real convictions. He does the opposite of what he says and changes positions constantly.The country is still recovering from a pandemic the damages of which are still unknown on the economy and the health of the people.The future is still unknown about this virus ! Biden is preoccupied with aiding foreigners invading the border and other misplaced priorities ! The fake hero of the democrats shut down a pipeline without any regard for the jobs of those employed in its construction. The ""cages "" in the border hold more children but they just don't call them cages any longer. As ""Clown in Chief"" "" Sleepy Joe"" is not the person to run this country and his party stole the election from the real POTUS Donald Trump with fraud and corruption. History will show the truth no matter how much the democrats and the corrupt MSM and their leftist social media companies and allies try to change it.

If you are interested in keeping your taxes low please consider this.  Right now our tax rate is the lowest it has been in city history. This is due in large part because of good financial management a booming economic development unlike anything any city has seen (60 businesses 3 of those being fortune 100 companies one being a fortune 10 and thousands of jobs being created) and the fact that I have been able to personally bring in $500 million of other-peoples-money to pay for infrastructure so that homeowners dont have to. Thats how you keep taxes low and still build infrastructure (roads water power and sewer). The land purchased by Facebook and Google increased in tax revenue 2 million%. Nobody comes close to competing with that.,political,Facebook
"Here are the Top 13 Bipartisan reasons Newsom should be Recalled... but there are so many more ....  1.Nursing Home Covid Deaths Gavin ordered ill equipped long term nursing home care facilities to accept covid positive elderly patients which spread and devastated the nursing home care population in our state. 2. His Support of Prop 47 Not only did he support Prop 47 but while mayor he appointed the co-author of prop 47 George Gascon to DA in San Francisco. This is the bill that decriminalized breaking and entering theft property crimes public urination and defecation in the street. 3. Wild fire and Destruction His policies on forestry management or ""lack there of"" has let to massive wildfire destruction over and over again. The fact that California stopped practices like clearing brush thinning the trees and controlled burnings in so much of our forests only made matters worse. 4. Government made drought Californians and businesses are perennially plagued with water shortages caused by man not the weather. Gavin Newsome refuse to build more water storage like reservoirs or dams and trillions of gallons of water each year are directed toward the ocean. He has also openly supported the decommission of four hydro-electric dams near the Kern river. This will shorten the supply of both water and electricity in California and costs will continue to go up. 5.The Self-Imposed Energy Crisis California of course has abundant energy. Yet California cannot reliably provide energy to the tens of millions of Californians and their businesses. Power shutdowns are a regular part of life and its biggest energy provider PG&E has warned shutdowns will be a fact of life for a decade. Newsome is nowhere to be found on spearheading an effort to have industry leaders from around the country get together to solve this problem that has costs so many jobs. Instead in his tiresome fashion Newsome blames others. 6 .The Unemployment Fraud Scandal The largest fraud scandal in the history of any state is exploding in California. Apparently controls were so lax that COVID-related benefits (over $100 billion in total) were paid to prisoners people out of state and fraudsters. 7.Job Losses and Highest Tax in the Nation. Tesla Hewlett-Packard Oracle are only a few of the major businesses leaving the state due to expensive unnecessary regulation and over taxation taking thousands of jobs with them which is also devastating to our economy. 8. California Budget Crisis California leads all states in debt and infrastructure problems. California is unsustainable because of its pension and other public debt. Newsom has done nothing to stave off the impending fiscal nightmare other than making it worse through higher spending. Lets not forget the purchase of 420 million masks to the tune of $316 million from a Chinese contractor. 9. Sanctuary state status and failing to enforce immigration. Gavin endorsed laws that favor illegal immigrants over that of our own citizens. Many illegal immigrants working under the table also take advantage of social welfare programs here in California where there are loop holes a plenty. 10. Hypocrisy and Sheer Arrogance While Gavin Newsom imposed rules against restaurant dining he was caught not wearing a mask not properly social distanced eating indoors at an expensive restaurant in California called the French Laundry. Also While his mandate that bars restaurants and Breweries remained closed He kept his own winery called Plump Jack open. While he supported public school closures which were harmful to so many children in California He made the choice to place his kids at an in person private school. Last but not least there is Newsom's $312 million Dollar mask deal to buy masks from a well-connected Chinese company while there were struggling impacted business here in our own state that could have been contracted to produce face masks. And To top that off I heard the masks from China failed to pass the federal safety certifications. What a waste. 11. Closure of churches during COVID which is a direct violation of the First Amendment. The Supreme Court ruled against Newsomes ruling. 12. The Homeless Crisis- blatant disregard of the problem. Instead of working toward a viable solution he spends millions on trailers and tents. 13. Releasing 76000 inmates - including violent and repeat offenders because of crowded conditions and/or COVID.",political,Facebook
Monday Musing  I was speaking with a friend I respect very much the other day. We were discussing the Sheriffs race. He had a unique observation. He said the job of a Sheriff is very much like a business owner. I gave that some thought and I have to agree. As Sheriff I will be the face of the Macon County Law Enforcement. I will be expected to make the big decisions in reference to how the department will progress. I will be the one who takes responsibility when one of my employees makes a mistake. I will make the decisions on who we hire and sadly who we fire. I will make the decisions on how to best utilize our assets to further our mission. I will be the one who puts the very best people I can find into the position they are best suited for. Especially when it comes to the leadership positions. Like President Harry Truman once said The buck stops here.  So as I look at my lifes experiences I try to find those qualities in me and where I was able to exercise them. They began when I was a teenager and President of my Junior Achievement group for two years. I learned about making a product sales and the like. Then also as a teenager I worked at a Boy Scout camp for a summer and learned independence and teamwork. I then learned responsibility as a young man when I got married. I had to learn I was not the most important person in the world as my family grew. They were. When I joined the Navy I learned leadership at every level. I had some great leaders teaching me by example. Something I carry with me today. As a Chief in the Navy I learned that you take care of those in your charge and they will walk through the gates of hell for you. I learned about placing the most qualified personnel into the jobs they are best suited for. I also learned about work ethic and thinking outside the box to get the job done. When I worked for the grocery chain Publix I learned about customer service; making our customers happy meant they kept coming back and shopping our store. Then I began my career as a law enforcement officer. There I learned the meaning of service. I learned about all sorts of people and how regardless of who or what they were I was there to ensure their safety. I further learned about leadership and working with people. I learned that people are people and they all have a right to a safe and happy living environment.  Now this brings me to the job of Sheriff. I believe that a Sheriff doesnt necessarily have to jump out of the car and chase bad guys. He isnt responsible for advising the suspects of their Miranda rights or even ensuring that there is proper probable cause in the arrest. He needs to administer the department. He needs to ensure his employees are happy well taken care of well trained and have all the tools they need to execute their duties. What is the icing on the cake is a Sheriff who has all of these qualities and can recognize when the details of the job are not being completed correctly. A Sheriff who can look at a particularly tough situation and can recommend a tactic or process that hasnt been tried before. A Sheriff who knows the job inside and out.  I am that person who has all of those traits and qualifications. I am the best candidate to move our Macon County Sheriffs Office into the next phase. I have been leadership tested and experience proven!,political,Facebook
"MODERN MONETARY THEORY AND INFLATION  Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) offers a description of monetary operations which has drawn increased national attention over the past two decades. The proponents of MMT are mercilessly maligned by orthodox economists the press and others; their views are often badly distorted in various press publications.  MMT puts forth the idea that monetary sovereign nations: nations with their own free floating currencies are not budget constrained in their spending practices. Sovereign nations such as the U.S. which create their own currencies cannot possibly be constrained by funding issues as they create their own currency and there is no operational limit on the amount of currency which they can produce. There are practical inflationary constraints on a sovereign monetary authority's production of money but funding constraints are self-imposed and do not reflect the ability of a sovereign monetary nation to spend as appropriate on a nation's needs.  The mechanics for MMT go like this. When the federal government spends money enters into a checking account. This spending action has in effect and in reality based on definitional categories of money actually produced new money. When the federal government collects taxes or borrows it destroys money: it takes money out of the economy. There is no natural law which states that federal expenditures must equal taxation and borrowing. In other words the Federal government need not fund federal deficit spending with debt. This is a policy choice. Households must match that which comes in with that which goes out but governments which create their own currencies are not likewise constrained. The truth of these statements is readily demonstrated through an examination of the U.S. colonial period during which colonial governments spent currencies into existence. The North's use of Greenbacks during the Civil War provides another example of this practice.  Excessive money creation without adequate money destruction i.e. taxation and borrowing will create inflation in the goods services and asset markets. MMTers readily acknowledge this point. Inflation occurs in the goods and services sectors when expenditures exceed productive capacity or in MMT words when the economy bumps up against real resource restraints. This makes perfect sense. This is also where MMT gets badly misrepresented in the press as economists financial analysts and others make the outrageous claim that MMT promotes the view that the federal government can endlessly spend without inflationary consequences. A recent opinion piece in The Hill (March 30 2021) stated: ""For those unaccustomed with MMT in essence it states that the U.S. government can print and spend money limitlessly."" This is not the MMT view and the promoters of such a view generally reveal their lack of serious study of MMT or worse MMT views are cynically misrepresented in an effort to impose discipline on federal government spending.  While on this topic we should not allow the current system to escape criticism on the inflation front. The system's dependence on unemployment underemployment and low wages in order to preserve price stability create other inflationary forces which generally go unrecognized. These unrecognized inflationary forces include police prisons the U.S. military and other unproductive activities which do not directly add to the production of goods and services. Much of the need or perceived need for these services can be directly linked to low income conditions in large segments of the U.S. population. The U.S. military is included here as it offers employment to impoverished workers and it is a necessary appendage to the competitive and inherently expansionary nature of the capitalist system.  The unemployed require state support and it is right to provide this support; but these unemployed labor earnings combined with earnings from labor and capital which result from the nation's roughly $730 billion military budget and additional large earnings from employment in prisons police forces and so forth: all of which adds nothing to the production of goods and services puts upward pressure on the prices of these goods and services. To date countervailing deflationary forces have hidden these inflationary costs. Without consideration of these inflationary forces we immediately go to wage gains as the source of inflationary pressure. As nice as it would be to see a military budget of zero one has to wonder about the deflationary impact of such a budget. Nonetheless a demilitarized world is a worthy goal and it would be better to direct soldiers into productive rather than destructive activities.  Part of MMT's theoretical framework is a full employment federal jobs program which guarantees employment to any willing participant at a respectable minimum wage along with healthcare and childcare services. MMT correctly perceives that one of the major problems with the free market economy is there is a constant pool of unemployed underemployed and low paid labor which damages both the individual and the broader national economy. Under the MMT scheme the wage in the job guarantee program would effectively set the national minimum wage. During expansionary times the private sector would bid labor out of the job program and during recessionary times labor would fall back into the job program. The job guarantee would moderate economic cycles and build a productive national workforce.  MMTers generally believe there is much available space for federal spending before real resource capacity is fully utilized--the point at which inflationary pressures begin to build. There are examples which back their view. Japan has struggled with deflationary pressures since the 1990s. During the past decade Japan has gone on a money creation binge which has resulted in a national debt to GDP ratio which approaches 240% more than double the U.S. ratio of debt to GDP. Yet Japan's inflation rate still hovers around zero. In the U.S. despite vigorous efforts to the contrary the nation's central bank the Federal Reserve has been unable to achieve a 2% inflation target. Both of these examples demonstrate the strong deflationary forces present in the global economy: this provides space for expanded money creation.  Would a federal full employment jobs program have a long term inflationary impact? It is difficult to say. MMTers say no. To me the answer is not so clear. What is clear however is that if a ""healthy"" non-inflationary economy is dependent as it has been during previous decades on a pool of unemployed underemployed and low wage workers then the economy is either flawed in its design or we are using a wrong set of measurements. Current accounting measures facilitate private sector measurements of profits and losses but fail to account for the broader social gains and losses associated with such activity. We all know that full employment is better than non full employment. Yet inflation measures which are important for money supply management purposes have dictated a near constant state of unemployment. The possible exception to this general rule is WWII which essentially amounted to a full employment federal jobs program.  If inflation measures and private firm accounting practices which prevent full employment violate that which we know to be true i.e. full employment is better than unemployment then it is time to create new measurements and accounting practices which better reflect the reality of what is happening in the broader national economy.  MMT offers accommodation to capitalist national economies with free floating sovereign currencies. Capitalists ought to embrace MMT ideas because capitalism will not survive its current form. If capitalism does not embrace necessary reform one variant of which MMT represents the other direction involves increasing social discontent oppression and violence. Few people capitalist or non capitalist want to wander down this path.  If the MMT plan were put into place and it were to prove unworkable due to inflationary pressures then either a new set of measurements and accounting practices should be developed which reflect the broader gains achieved through a guaranteed full employment program or the economy would need other radical restructuring which ensures a decent standard of living for all people.

LET'S EXPEL THE JOE BIDEN IS A DECENT MAN MYTH!  Add your NOT So DECENT comment and SHARE! SHARE! SHARE!  Biden is for Partial birth abortion even if the baby is partially out of the womb.   The ever-increasing size and familiarity of the second trimester fetus blurs the line between abortion and infanticide for even the most hardened professionals and preterm infants have now been recorded as surviving as early as 5 months.   This is nowhere more readily apparent than in the grotesque partial-birth abortion procedure method in which a living fetus is extracted intact from the womb only to be killed in the process of delivery. The concern to draw a bright line in the law between elective abortion and infanticide led Congress to enact the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act in 2003 which the U.S. Supreme Court upheld in 2007. The federal partial-birth abortion (PBA) law prohibits procedures where a fetus while still alive is partially delivered with the intent to take action to kill the fetus after he or she has been delivered to certain anatomical landmarks.   This is not Decent!  Biden is not for school choice eliminating the opportunity for kids to get a good education that would allow them to rise above the challenges present in poor inner-city and rural communities.   This is not Decent  Biden is not for border security!   Open borders allow unskilled people to enter our country and take jobs that unskilled and young people need to learn work skills that would allow them to gain the skills needed to move up the economic latter. Even most Hispanics citizens are for border security as a lot of their jobs are lost to these new illegal immigrants. Open borders also opens the door for gang members criminals and drugs to easily enter our country.   This is not Decent!,political,Facebook
Here is a different way to look at the current surge of illegal immigration. There are two very different groups coming with very different motivations. The first group of illegal border crossers are the traditional ones we are most familiar with. They are primarily men crossing secretly with the intent to slip into American society and work jobs that unscrupulous employers offer them so they can either send money back to their families they left behind or support their families that joined them on their underground journey. The other group are the ones trying to take advantage of international asylum laws that grant refugees the right to stay in a receiving country while their case is heard. A subset of this group are children that are abandoned at the border by their parents hoping that doing so would give their children a better chance of staying in our country legally and having a better life than they could have in their home country. I compare the overall illegal immigration situation to a drug epidemic. The people coming across are desperately seeking something that would make them feel better about their lives and they are being fed promises by criminal groups that are making huge profits in facilitating their journeys. Just like drug addicts they are committing a crime but are also victims of crime. The criminal gangs that victimize the first group have to operate in the U.S. in order to keep their clients from being discovered. This makes them vulnerable to US law enforcement agencies. Some of these groups have figured out that there is a lot less risk in working with the second group because they can leave their charges on the other side of the border so they can cross on their own with the intention of getting caught. The Biden administration is concentrating their effort on changing the conditions in the golden triangle countries so these people wont be encouraged to pay these criminal groups. While this is laudable it will take a good deal of time and resources to make these kinds of changes. A more immediate mission that would help stem this tide would be to go after the criminal gangs that are getting rich from these desperate people. This would require cooperation from Mexico and US law enforcement agencies. CBP should start enforcement efforts in Mexico much the same way the DEA does. With the threat of extradition and financial seizures these gangs might back away from human trafficking as the risk/reward ratio makes it less profitable. The larger cartels would go back to concentrating on drug trafficking and the smaller gangs might not have corrupt officials in their pockets and may decide to get out of the business to avoid prison.,political,Facebook

"BEFORE EMBRACING AMERICA-FIRST AGENDA DAVID PERDUE WAS AN OUTSOURCING EXPERT  (Share if you believe that Georgians should know the sad truth about their Senator DA2020)  Mr. Perdue who faces one of two runoff elections in Georgia that will determine control of the Senate built a business record that shifted manufacturing and jobs overseas.  By Stephanie Saul Richard Fausset and Michael LaForgia  Jan. 1 2021 Updated 1:24 p.m. ET  The biographical video from Senator David Perdues first campaign in 2014 celebrated a narrative arc that many fellow Georgians either related to or have aspired to: the story of a humble boy from rural America whose hard work catapulted him into a global business career navigating free markets and faraway lands all the while gathering stores of wisdom and wealth.  The embrace of global commerce has been a hallmark of modern Georgia showcased in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics dissected by the novelist Tom Wolfe and promoted by among others Mr. Perdues Nafta-loving cousin Sonny Perdue governor from 2003 to 2011. Three years later in his maiden run for office David Perdue would boast of his international experience as a consultant and chief executive while speaking to a gathering of Republicans in Bibb County close to his middle Georgia hometown.  Theres only one candidate in this race thats ever lived outside the United States Mr. Perdue said. How can you bring value to a debate about the economy unless you have any understanding about the free-enterprise system and what it takes to compete in the global economy?  Now facing one of a pair of Jan. 5 runoff elections in Georgia that will determine control of the Senate Mr. Perdue has continued to make his global business experience the essence of his brand. But that has highlighted the contradictions that emerge  in his career and in his character but also in his party and his region  as he embraces the populist America-first strains of Trumpism.  The man who has lately voiced support for some of President Trumps signature tariffs built his career as an unapologetic free-trading practitioner of the outsourcing arts. As a top executive at companies including Reebok Sara Lee and Dollar General he was often deeply involved in the shift of manufacturing and jobs to low-wage factories in China and other Asian countries.  A review of that business record shows a man who achieved significant successes making millions managing complex periods of corporate growth and change and creating domestic jobs particularly at Dollar General. But there were also disappointments like the failed trucking business he ran with Sonny Perdue and his fruitless effort to rescue a company called Pillowtex that brought heartbreak to a North Carolina mill town. And while the senator often speaks of having led the Reebok turnaround as president of the companys flagship brand in the early 2000s he moved on from the company after a rival who today questions Mr. Perdues contribution to the turnaround was installed above him.  The man who spent much of his life broadening his horizons took to the stage at a Trump rally in Macon before Election Day and mocked Senator Kamala Harriss first name mispronouncing it with an exaggerated stumble that to critics amounted to crude racism. His campaign has called it an innocent mispronunciation.  The man who dons a faded denim jacket to reinforce his connection to everyday Georgians has a record of aloofness with an aversion to holding town hall meetings and a thin skin for tough questions. Now he has chosen a further withdrawal declining to participate in additional debates after one in which his Democratic opponent Jon Ossoff called him a crook for his prolific stock-trading while in the Senate.  Mr. Perdue did not respond to requests to be interviewed for this article. In response to written questions his campaign issued a statement that said in part Throughout his four decades working in the real world before being elected to the Senate David Perdue led American companies that saved and created tens of thousands of American jobs.  As when he first ran for office six years ago Mr. Perdue who is 71 regularly invokes those decades in business to style himself the ultimate Washington outsider though it was his cousin the former governor who gave him his entree to politics and helped nurture his ascent.  Taking aim at his 33-year-old opponent who runs a London-based documentary film company and has never held public office Mr. Perdues campaign has fixed on a $1000 payment from a Hong Kong media company to charge that Mr. Ossoff had a two-year working relationship with the Chinese Communist Party.  In its statement to The New York Times most of which dwelled on Mr. Ossoff the Perdue campaign called it ridiculous to compare the senators leadership in American companies with Jon Ossoffs foreign-owned company with shady ties to the Chinese government. (Mr. Ossoffs spokeswoman dismissed that claim as one of the most laughable smear campaigns in Georgia history.)  Mr. Perdues campaigns biographical video meanwhile has been refreshed for 2020. Edited out is a section that showed the senator posing with his wife on Chinas Great Wall.  From a Watermelon Patch to the World Mr. Perdue grew up in Warner Robins a small city about 100 miles south of Atlanta home to Robins Air Force Base. Airmen coming and going from foreign deployments connected the city to the wider world.  But life could still move to rural rhythms. Mr. Perdue traces his roots back to nearby Bonaire a farming community where Perdues settled in the early 1800s. Mr. Perdue recalls picking watermelons on a family-owned farm alongside Sonny who would become Mr. Trumps agriculture secretary in 2017.  While farming was a family pursuit Mr. Perdues parents followed a different path  education. David Perdue Sr. eventually became county schools superintendent.  Mr. Perdue would later go on to extol his fathers leadership in desegregating the countys schools but the historical record provides a different picture revealing the school system employed delay tactics until the N.A.A.C.P. sued and a court ordered it to comply.  The future senator graduated from high school in 1968 two years before the schools were fully integrated. Standout student varsity athlete and class president he was awarded a coveted appointment to the Air Force Academy.  David has those personal traits that cause him to be recognized as a person of worth his high school principal Milton Sutherlin wrote in a recommendation letter. His character is that always of a gentleman and he holds high those Christian ideals that speak well of his home training his school and his community.  But while the Air Force would prove a good fit for his cousin Sonny who served three years and was promoted to the rank of captain it was not so for David. He received Bs and Cs in a brief stint at the academy and by early 1969 let it be known that he wanted out.  I have realized that I have made a mistake and I do not want this type of career he wrote in January 1969 to Jack Brinkley the congressman who had sponsored him. His plan was to attend the Georgia Institute of Technology and try to play basketball.  His basketball career never materialized but Mr. Perdue would earn undergraduate and masters degrees at Georgia Tech. And over the next three decades he would position himself on the winning side of a seismic economic shift sweeping the South.  A Global Man of the New South Increasingly and inexorably the regions apparel and textile industry was turning to foreign contractors to manufacture its products. The disruption which meant thousands of layoffs for low-skilled workers in Southern mill towns was Mr. Perdues ticket to the world. He became an expert in outsourcing.  I spent most of my career doing that he would later say in a deposition.  His apprenticeship in outsourcing began while he was still in school. In 1972 he joined Kurt Salmon Associates a consulting company that had earned its reputation sending bright young engineers into Southern clothing factories to solve technical problems and boost efficiency. The company had a large Atlanta office and by the 1970s was aspiring to a more-global footprint.  The city was too. Born as a regional railroad hub Atlanta had begun adding international flights to its growing airport creating yet more opportunities for a metropolis that had already rocketed past its Southern rivals fueled by relentless civic boosterism and a reputation for racial moderation.  William Sand an engineer who worked in the Atlanta office with Mr. Perdue recalled that in the 1970s as Southern factories were beginning to close new ones were opening in Mexico and Asia. Kurt Salmon he said became experts at helping companies source product from overseas.  Mr. Perdue left in 1984 and worked at a few other places before ending up at Sara Lee which was best known for its baked goods but was also an apparel manufacturer. He was hired in 1992 to open a headquarters in Hong Kong where he lived for two years establishing operations throughout Asia from the ground up he would later say.  The ripple effects reached home. In 1994 the company eliminated thousands of jobs including 230 at its Spring City Knitting plant in Cartersville Ga. Most of the workers were women who earned $4.25 an hour sewing garments.  By that time Mr. Perdue was globe-trotting with yet another company Haggar Clothing which had chosen him to lead its international operation with one aim  increasing foreign sourcing. Within three years he had done just that boosting international production from 60 percent to 75 percent. As company plants were closed in the United States workers in Mexico performed the job for $1.50 an hour.  By 1998 Mr. Perdue was headed to Reebok which ultimately promoted him to lead its main division as it forged licensing deals with the National Football League and the National Basketball Association. Major league teams with their star power and marquee players burnished Reeboks cachet leading to its acquisition by Adidas in 2005. The manufacturing of most of the companys products was outsourced primarily to China and elsewhere in Asia.  The 2014 video produced by Mr. Perdues Senate campaign  in which he discusses licensing agreements  portrays him as the architect of Reeboks turnaround. Even in the wake of improvements in the companys business though Reeboks chairman Paul Fireman passed over Mr. Perdue for promotion to the companys No. 2 job.  In December 2001 the company announced that Mr. Perdue who as head of the Reebok brand had reported directly to Mr. Fireman would instead report to Jay Margolis who had formerly headed other brands for the company but was suddenly named chief operating officer.  Paul Fireman decided he wanted one guy to run it all from a C.O.O. point of view said Kenneth Watchmaker Reeboks chief financial officer until 2006. Thats where the two of them competed and Jay got the nod and David left after a period of time.  Mr. Margolis says that he and Mr. Fireman actually pushed out Mr. Perdue who has characterized his departure from Reebok as voluntary. I look back on David. He couldnt make decisions. He was so indecisive he couldnt move the product forward Mr. Margolis said.  As for the licensing deals Mr. Margolis said those were the brainchild of Mr. Fireman.  Mr. Fireman reached by phone said I dont remember firing him. He added: Im not challenging Jays recollection; I just dont remember myself.  Mr. Fireman did not address a question about the extent to which Mr. Perdue was involved in turning around the brands. A long time has passed since then he said. David was a good solid employee for the four or five years he was with me at a high level Mr. Fireman said. And I knew him as a good person.  Within months of Mr. Margoliss promotion Mr. Perdue was in discussions with a headhunter seeking an executive with the know-how and experience to turn around Pillowtex a troubled sheet and towel manufacturer with well-known brands in its portfolio including Cannon Fieldcrest and Royal Velvet.  Leaving behind what he would later describe as $5 million worth of in-the-money unvested Reebok stock options Mr. Perdue agreed in spring 2002 to take the job as chief executive of Pillowtex.  The company was just emerging from bankruptcy and thousands of workers at its home base in Kannapolis N.C. viewed Mr. Perdue as a potential savior according to Scott Shimizu a former executive vice president. Looking back though Mr. Shimizu said he believed Mr. Perdues inaction led to the companys demise.  The company needed to sell off assets quickly and outsource production to survive  with the possibility of retaining part of its United States work force  but Mr. Shimizu says Mr. Perdue took few steps to do either.  He didnt really help us said Mr. Shimizu. We were waiting for him to bring the Ten Commandments to us. They never came.  Mr. Perdue would later say he had been misled about the depth of the companys financial problems including a badly underfunded pension plan. He became embroiled in a dispute with Pillowtex over its failure to live up to the compensation agreement he had negotiated.  The company imploded and about 7650 people lost their jobs most of them in North Carolina. The Charlotte Observer called it the largest mass layoff in state history. The hard feelings toward Mr. Perdue were rife in Kannapolis and in 2014 his Democratic Senate opponent Michelle Nunn would release an ad set there highlighting the bitterness.  Mr. Perdue who had been at Pillowtex less than a year soon found a new opportunity that would also touch large numbers of working-class people: at Dollar General. The company boasts that 25 percent of its products retail for less than $1.  As chief executive Mr. Perdue oversaw the opening of a Hong Kong office in 2004 increasing the global sourcing that helps to provide the low everyday price our customers count on according to a company announcement. Among the global sources were manufacturers in China records show.  Low wages were another way the company controlled costs. Store managers sued the company complaining that they were not paid overtime even though they took on nonmanagerial duties unloading trucks and stocking shelves after hours. Some of their claims as well as legal complaints from female workers who said they were inequitably compensated resulted in payouts.  Dollar General flourished under Mr. Perdues leadership adding more than 2000 stores and expanding the use of coolers to stock more grocery items. Former colleagues who visited Mr. Perdue at the companys Tennessee headquarters said it was apparent he was preparing Dollar General for acquisition. In 2007 Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company announced it would purchase Dollar General for about $7 billion. It was later reported that Mr. Perdue walked away with a $42 million payout.  The Perdue family had lived in Nashvilles tony Belle Meade section but it was time to head back to Georgia where Mr. Perdue would ultimately settle on Sea Island a wealthy sanctuary on the southern coast.  The Outsider In 2010 as Sonny Perdue was finishing his second term as governor he named his cousin David to the board of the Georgia Ports Authority.  About a year later records show the cousins formed a company called Perdue Partners which in December 2012 acquired Benton Express an Atlanta-based trucking company that had operated as a regional family business for nearly 80 years. They renamed it Benton Global and pledged to reinvigorate the business by drawing on overseas connections and especially David Perdues ties to Asia according to press reports and interviews with former employees.  The Perdues installed two loyalists of the former governor in top management positions and oversaw the purchase of new tractor-trailers. But the promised new international business never materialized and the company already suffering from flagging revenues struggled to pay its bills. It closed abruptly in 2015 leaving more than 500 truck drivers clerks and terminal workers unemployed.  As a member of the ports authority board Mr. Perdue voted repeatedly on infrastructure improvements that might have benefited his trucking business The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. A spokesman for Mr. Perdue said at the time that none of the votes posed a conflict of interest or aided Mr. Perdue financially.  In 2013 Georgias senior senator Saxby Chambliss announced that he would not stand for re-election the next year. In David Perdues telling he drove to see his cousin and tried to convince him to run. Well he told me he didnt feel led to do so but then he said I should consider running Mr. Perdue later recalled in an interview.  When Mr. Perdue decided to run he recruited top aides from his cousins campaign staff. Davids team was Sonnys team said Jack Kingston a longtime Republican congressman who also sought the vacant seat. Sonny Perdue he said was very instrumental in his cousins campaign.  For all that David Perdue branded himself the outsider the man with the real-world business savvy needed to effect change. The Republican primary was crowded with well-known and seasoned politicians and Mr. Perdue attacked them for their seasoning portraying them in ads as ineffectual mewling babies.  ""We were hoping that we could find an Achilles heel  hes lazy hes going to say something stupid Mr. Kingston said of the campaign. We found him to be pretty disciplined and hard-working. I have to give him good marks.  After defeating Mr. Kingston in a primary runoff Mr. Perdue went on to face Ms. Nunn an executive at a nonprofit whose father Sam Nunn was a former Democratic senator from Georgia. Though both candidates benefited from famous family names Ms. Nunn thought she might gain the upper hand by focusing on the negative effects of Mr. Perdues embrace of globalism.  A month before the election a transcript surfaced of a nine-year-old deposition in which Mr. Perdue said he had spent most of my career outsourcing. Questioned by reporters Mr. Perdue replied that he was proud of that record. This is a part of American business part of any business he said adding People do that all day.  Ms. Nunn pressed the point in her ads and on the debate stage. But she was the underdog and 2014 proved to be a bad year for Democrats burdened by a lack of enthusiasm for President Barack Obama and his signature legislation the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Perdue blasted Mr. Obamas handling of the Ebola virus crisis and vowed to repeal Obamacare. He practically waltzed to victory.  The outsider arrived on Capitol Hill pushing a term-limit plan and railing against career politicians to the annoyance of his fellow Georgia Republican Senator Johnny Isakson according to two people familiar with the views of Mr. Isakson who had spent many years in politics and was gearing up for a third Senate run.  The record Mr. Perdue built was reliably conservative. He submitted a far-fetched  and critics said regressive  proposal to replace income taxes with sales taxes on goods and services. He proposed limits on the ability of immigrants to sponsor family members instead giving priority to college-educated young people with high-paying jobs.  In the beginning he also spoke and voted as one would expect a free trader to do. In 2015 he voted to give Mr. Obama enhanced powers to negotiate big trade agreements including the Trans-Pacific Partnership the most substantial trade accord since the North American Free Trade Agreement of the 1990s.  But Mr. Perdue was also early to see the potential in Mr. Trump who offered a kind of mirror reflection of Mr. Perdues own political persona as chief executive change agent. The two men reportedly met at Trump Tower during Mr. Perdues 2014 run. And after Mr. Trumps inauguration the senator could be unrestrained in his praise at one point comparing the new president to Winston Churchill. This guy I think is a historic person of destiny at a time and place in America when weve got to make a right-hand turn here Mr. Perdue said.  Mr. Perdue and his fellow Republicans quickly had to grapple with the presidents determination to break the partys mold on global trade. Three days into his tenure Mr. Trump tore up the Trans-Pacific Partnership calling it a rape of our country.  Although Mr. Perdues campaign has said that he consistently supported the presidents America-first trade policies the senator spoke out in 2017 against a Trump-backed plan to impose a border adjustment tax that would have raised taxes on companies that import goods into the United States. A year later he criticized the presidents plan to impose steep tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum calling for a more targeted strategy.  But by late 2019 as Mr. Perdues re-election bid on a ticket with Mr. Trump loomed he seemed more amenable to the presidents approach.  The tariffs are creating the opportunity for people to come to the table he said according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. For the first time in five decades we are standing up to the Chinese and other trading partners around the world and all we want is equal access and a level playing field.  The crosscurrents on trade could be tricky and suddenly Mr. Perdues globalist background made him susceptible to attacks from fellow conservatives. In September 2019 Lou Dobbs the powerful pro-Trump TV personality reported that Mr. Perdue and another senator were visiting Beijing where Mr. Dobbs warned they may well be undercutting U.S. and China trade negotiations and progress made by the president. Mr. Dobbs noted Mr. Perdues outsourcing record.  A day later Mr. Dobbs issued a correction noting that Mr. Trump had approved the trip.  The China Problem In 2016 Mr. Perdue had preached Republican unity as the divisive Mr. Trump began gaining ground in the G.O.P. primary. But the senator helped spark a civil war among Georgia Republicans in 2020 when he and his Georgia runoff-mate Senator Kelly Loeffler demanded the resignation of the states top elections official a Republican calling the election he oversaw an embarrassment.  More recently the senators supported a failed Texas lawsuit that would have blocked the election result in Georgia where President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. beat Mr. Trump by about 12000 votes and in three other states Mr. Trump lost.  The battle over Mr. Perdues Senate seat has been no less fierce. Mr. Ossoffs crook attack in a televised debate in October was based on disclosures that Mr. Perdue the Senates most prolific stock trader made a number of well-timed trades including in companies that could be affected by his committees votes. An investigation of some of Mr. Perdues stock dealings by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission ended without prosecution and Mr. Perdue has used those facts to argue that he has done nothing wrong.  Mr. Ossoff has revived criticism of Mr. Perdues outsourcing record. And the senator has also had to fend off charges of bigotry for both his mockery of Ms. Harriss name and an online campaign ad that showed a photo of Mr. Ossoff who is Jewish with a lengthened nose. Mr. Perdues campaign has called the image in the ad an accident caused by a filter applied by an outside vendor handling the graphic design.  For his part Mr. Perdues closing attack is in keeping with Republicans emerging argument that Democrats like Mr. Ossoff are too weak and in some cases too compromised to stand up to the threat of Chinese global dominance.  Mr. Ossoff Mr. Perdue contends is a radical left-winger with a grave China problem. He cites as proof a $1000 agreement that allowed a large media company in Hong Kong PCCW to rebroadcast a documentary Mr. Ossoffs company produced about the Islamic State.  Previous reports have characterized one of PCCWs investors China Unicom as a state-owned Chinese company a point Mr. Perdue has used in an effort to tie Mr. Ossoff to the Chinese Communist Party.  For two years he worked with the C.C.P. the senator said in a Fox News interview.  Mr. Perdue has said little about his own China ties.  In 1991 the year before he headed to Hong Kong to build Sara Lees Asian outsourcing operation from the ground up the company proudly announced a new foothold in Asia  a deal in Fuzhou China.  The joint venture Fujian Sara Lee Consumer Products manufactured toothpaste shampoo and other personal care products. It was partially owned by the Chinese government according to a report in The Chicago Tribune announcing the venture.  As the Fujian arrangement continued Mr. Perdue busied himself with building Sara Lees first centralized sourcing operation in Asia including in mainland China he said in a deposition in 2005. That involved lining up suppliers and overseeing quality control and human rights practices for the company which manufactured Hanes clothing among other things.  No American firm could have established such an operation in China at that time without dealing extensively with the government or the Communist Party industry experts said.  You dont just wander into China without central government and local party officials wanting to know what youre doing said Michael Posner a professor at New York Universitys Stern School of Business and a top human rights official during the Obama administration. Its a very controlled environment. And anybody there who is dealing with factories would have had to deal with that. (While some of its products remain on the market Sara Lee has since disbanded.)  This week The Times asked Mr. Perdues campaign if he had any other business involving the Chinese government.  The campaign declined to answer.  Kate Kelly and Jannat Batra contributed reporting. Susan Beachy Kitty Bennett and Sheelagh McNeill contributed research.  More on the Georgia Senate Races Democrats Georgia Hopes Rest on Jon Ossoff 33.

Today we learned the sad news that all indoor entertainment centers and bars will go into shutdown mode once again. I am so sorry about this. We had just been told it was okay to reopen with restrictions. We were doing everything that was asked of us. However now the whole state of California is in the purple (worst) tier. Although this is such an extremely difficult time for Aloha Family Billiards (over 40 years old) we must do everything we can to comply with new Covid orders. Thousands of small businesses such as mine have been permanently closed due to the shutdowns. We have lost almost everything. I hope that the government will take small businesses into consideration for financial help until this Covid crisis is over. We employ thousands of people and small businesses are so appreciated and loved by their communities. Social meeting places like my family pool hall provide not only entertainment but a way of meeting new friends and sometimes life-time partners. This is really affecting people that I talk with in a very negative way. I hear them say they feel trapped depressed afraid out of their minds they miss their friends (especially the young people) and so many more complaints. Aloha Billiards has always been a happy place to go laugh play pool listen to the music playing loudly in the background and of course watching sports with friends and strangers! Now it has all stopped. We all need help. Please if there is anyone who is reading this that may be able to help understand that I not only speak for myself but for thousands of fellow small business owners and thousands of people unemployed from their jobs. My employees tell me they would rather be working than receiving unemployment. Great people! After a while you just want to get back to your life. Maybe some of you in Hollywood who we have supported during your careers can come together for small businesses like mine. I know your industry is also having it hard without theaters and other forms of entertainment shutdown. However most of you actors make hundreds of millions of dollars. Can't you put something together for small businesses. Perhaps those of you who can help might think about picking a business and become a sponsor just until we get control on Covid. We supported you on your way up now can we depend on you to support us? We are one people and if you are in a position to help than would you consider it? What a great Christmas gift for us small businesses and it's employees. To be a part of helping the building blocks of America (small businesses) would make you feel great to know you played a part in our survival. You can always reach me through my online account. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for any consideration you may show concerning this matter. May God bless us all and keep us safe during this horrible Covid virus. Thank you. Note: I have never in my life asked anyone for a dime. But I see my fellow business owners walking around like their life is over (me included) my employees are really suffering my customers seem like they lost their happy spirt and now are so sad.

The next decade will say a lot about how we live our lives in Greater Minnesota. Over the past two decades we have been losing people to the cities and out of state. The purpose of this post is not to be all doom and gloom or to cause fear. It is about how we need to plan for the future and we need to look forward over looking back.  The heart of western Minnesota I believe is rooted in our agricultural history. Agriculture can also be what carries us to the future.  One of the things I have been working on lately is looking into the possibilities of hemp. As I mentioned last week the more the government pushes electric cars the more it will impact ethanol demand and therefor corn demand. We need to have a plan for when that happens. It will not be tonight or tomorrow but it will happen.  There is a couple of downsides for hemp today but it is also what will drive opportunities. The first is that it is not a crop that has been grown in large fields in the US therefore large equipment has not yet been developed for the mass growing and harvesting to maximize the plant yield.  Secondly we do not have the infrastructure to process hemp for all of its usages in the US. There are some areas working on it but it is still in its infancy. The areas who develop that infrastructure first will be the areas most able to capitalize on it.  Hemp has many usages from what you already see such as CBD oil to replacing plastic in many applications replacing lumber by pressing it into boards (takes much less time to grow hemp then a tree!) hempcrete (a biomas product used for construction and insulation) and animal feed just to name a few.  So what is holding us back? What normally does government interference. You remember how I mentioned animal feed earlier? Hemp meal can top proteins of 20% only issue is you can not legally use it for feed commercially. THC level restrictions are another if a crop has THC levels above .3 the crop will be destroyed.  I spoke with Colin Peterson about this and he was telling me they had tried to make this level 1% over .3 but other groups pushed back on it.  If we overcome this government interference private companies will be willing to make these investments in the infrastructure and this can bring jobs and industry back to our areas and breath life back into small town Minnesota.  Again this does not happen overnight it is probably a decade away but I can see a co-op someday in western Mn doing the same with hemp as we already do with sugar.  If we want to keep our way of life we need to fight for it and build to the future.  Give me your feed back and opinions I aim to represent you I need your input.  Bull,political,Facebook
"This woman Michelle Obama is either really in denial or a poor malicious propaganda artist. She is the one who said ""when they go low we go high"". Nothing could hav been more false. Basically the left say things that sound great but intend the exact opposite and do the opposite. Now she comes out and says that the protests were almost entirely peaceful and Trump is making it up that they are violent to create racial division. Again this is Goebbels speech because she and her husband are doing everything to stir racial divisions and chaos and accusing the other side of that which they are guilty of.The most corrupt first lady with the most corrupt President in history the Obamas are at it again.  If you see racial division and hate of police and violence they ""created it"" Hate of country they created it. Blacks against whites they created it. Poor againts rich they created it.Huge trade imbalances with China Mexico and Canada and other countries they created it. Loss of manufacturing jobs they created it.  The IRS the FBI the CIA the NSA the DOJ were all weaponized against the people for the first time in American history. They created it. They built an America where the youth think that socialism is better than the system that has made this country the greatest country in the world and the super power of the world. They created it. This has been the country where everyone who can wants to come to.  Michelle you are irrelevant despite the pandering of some lefties. You are a fraud of history with your husband Obama.! Antifa and BLM and defunding the police are all your doing and you should be ashamed of yourselves.You are the real racists and your duplicity and misinformation ads are totally fake. You are fake and phony Michelle Obama and you are a divider of people.Shame on you ! you have abused your minority status and your being black is no longer good enough for you to continue being racist and stopping legitimate criticism of your person.  Saying the protests were peaceful is fake news and you are fake too. You are also extremely boring and predictable.

After today's election we will be looking toward June 8th for the General Election. Again I thank all of you who have supported me the last 4 years. I believe we all can see the growth that has taken place in Booneville MS. If you can't please take time to drive around downtown. Take a look at our new industries and jobs that have been created. Look at our new parks splash pads etc. Ask our children about our officers they see protecting them in schools daily. Look at our new police cars and fire trucks. Consider our new Police Department. Look at our Booneville Main Street Page Stroll down North 2nd and see the new businesses. There are numerous numerous initiatives that have taken place over the past four years. I certainly can't take the credit for all that's been accomplished. It has truly been a joint effort with all our city county state business owners investors etc. However the enthusiasm to see Booneville thrive is greater than we have seen in many many years! Folks we can't lose that. I will continue to work hard for you as I have. My family and I love Booneville MS and it's people and that love for my city started long before I was ever your Mayor. I have served you in the military as a city employee as election commissioner and as your Mayor. There's a lot of criticism taking place these days. A whole lot of things being said that would attempt to jeopardize my role as your Mayor for the next four years. I hear them and I see the actions but I am moving full steam ahead in prayer and commitment to you. I know I have been placed in this role by the confident vote from all of you and I have truly sought to be a servant leader in all I do. We have so much at stake! Our children need recreation here our elderly generation needs more opportunities for socialization and our beautiful city still needs to grow but we had to start somewhere and we together have progressed. Please be in prayer for my family and me as we continue to serve you and seek the best opportunities for Booneville MS! We are building a better Booneville and we aren't finished! The best is yet to come! #Keepthevisionalive #ThePeoplesMayor,political,Facebook
Tansi my name is Jeanine Starchief MGBHLM band member I am running for MGBHLM council and will go out to my community to get my message across to my people. I believe values are important when being a leader they define who we are as a person and one value that defines me is honesty. I am a honest person very respectful to others I am observent and I am a very good listener. I have compassion for others and am very empathetic. I know how it feels when I'm not heard. I will listen to the people and respect others views towards positive changes within our community. I wanted to tell the people what my plans are if I have the opportunity to make positive changes within our community and issues I think needs to be addressed. First and far most my priority will always be to focus on the community and address the needs of the people. One important area is housing we have families that want to come home or are in need of housing and there are no houses that are big enough for big families. I would provide this for the people by finding the funding to address the peoples needs. Also many of the people need renovations. There are many mold infested houses that are unhealthy for the families and the children. I would get the houses cleaned and have renovations and updates the houses which gives safety for the families. Also for the older houses many of them need updated renovations as well. My priority would be to focus on these houses that need renovations. My biggest dream is to build a brand-new school from nursery to grade 12. My focus would be to integrate more cultural and language based curriculum because of the loss of our culture & language. I think this is so important to focus on because our language is our identity. Listening to parents and band members who have great ideas too support children needs especially those with special needs will be a key element for the success of their futures. Providing services for the children will be a focus because they are the generation. Once a new school is built the current elementary school can be used as a learning resource centre that offers College and University classes online to help our people become successful independent individuals. There can also be trades in this facility offered as well. Classes for oil field tickets for people who wish to get camp jobs for people to join the work force. Many of the younger generation or people have never been introduced to our culture. By creating a treatment facility to help heal our people that have suffered from intergenerational abuse will provide counselling services and elders support to teach cultural life skills that will help parents raise their kids with better judgment and values to hand down to their children. Also this facility will help parents who have lost custody of their children to regain custody to build healthier families. I think this will push them to better there lives by getting their education to become apart of the work force. Also better security should be provided on the reservation to protect the children and their families. I know this is such a concern to the people and it should not be a concern. I would also like to add my services to the community so my people have access to this service which would better their health too naturally heal their bodies and reduce pain. The urbaners should also be remembered. They should have the same access to services the reserve provides. Thank you for taking the time in reading what I have planned. I will be adding more to my page  Sincerely Jeanine Starchief TCMD L.Ac R.Ac,political,Facebook

Nobody wants to build a business in a city that doesnt already have good jobs let alone the highest R.I.T.A. tax in the state.  I want to make Youngstown the face of new business growth and shy away from our current development plans that involve inefficient programs.  I stand by this because I have been around long enough to see it just isnt working. Generally speaking many of us have been around long enough to see its not working in addition to the new residents that can also see the problems within our community.  Its time to listen to our community and make a change for the better.  It all starts with you. It all starts with your vote.  Vote John White for Mayor,political,Facebook
Did you know that the City of Mattoon's population decreased by about 100 people per year from 2010-2020? 1000 people in ten years. 1000 potential buyers and spenders. 1000 moms dads brother grandmas grandpas sisters aunts uncles and friends have left our community.  When you vote for me you are voting for a candidate who realizes the importance in not just bringing great paying jobs but who places value on investing in our community so that our families and friends grow and prosper in Mattoon. It will be a priority of mine to recruit both businesses AND families to Mattoon.  If we as a community stand together and put in the work there is no doubt in my mind that we will prevail.,political,Facebook
"The Value of On The Job Learning  In a recent Flathead Beacon interview with House District 7 legislative candidates my opponent Frank Garner put forward the idea that ""...this is an important year to not be learning on the job. As one of millions of millennials whose had to struggle to work through an unending economic recession I've discovered the necessary value of doing just that.  I attended college with the plan of learning a valuable skill and earning a spot in a top firm in my industry building a career saving a nest egg and one day buying a house and starting a family. So did most of my University peers. What we came out with was multiple thousands of dollars in loan debt while competing for part-time work against Masters and PhD holders who had already been laid off in the great recession. No one told us all our work and study would put us in the same line for minimum-wage part-time contracting work as the rest of the US workforce.  So we scrambled and we moonlighted our way through this new economy. In my first three years out of school I worked nine separate jobs in seven industries in one year three at a time. I worked with a diverse range of people from every economic and social background in wildly different settings ranging from construction to retail to security to education. I adapted to different work cultures and different management structures different rules and expectations.  We millennials were forced to do this when our representatives failed to address the systemic issues our generation was facing. They continue to fail in that task now for Gen Z. Frank Garner is one of those legislators.  When I hear them deriding on the job learning it feels like a dis to everyone who has had to fight to live in this new gig economy. A dis on everyone struggling through 90hr work weeks with no benefits and no health coverage no sick leave and no PTO no savings and dwindling hope that they will ever be able to live the life that our parents and their parents enjoyed in Montana.  Maybe that's the problem. People in our legislature have no idea what it's really like to live and work in today's economy. And that's why we need some on the job learning.",political,Facebook
SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE PACKAGE: OH MY  Looks like the MMTers (Modern Monetary Theory people) are losing this round. The social infrastructure package which started off as a $6 trillion Bernie Sanders ambition then shrunk to a $3.5 trillion package is now lingering around $1.75 trillion or so. Various financial analysts think this a big deal but it is not. $1.75 trillion spread over 10 years is a measly $175 billion annually less than one quarter of the U.S. annual military budget. Apparently the powers-that-be believe that a powerful fighting force will gain a greater return on investment than a well-educated civilized people.  Maybe the Democrats could revert to the Sander's $6 trillion package spread it over 100 years and make everyone happy. The progressives could claim victory because they will have gotten a $6 trillion package. The Party's conservative wing could claim victory because they limited the additional spending to $60 billion annually. Even the Republicans would be thrilled because they could point to the $6 trillion number and call the Democrats spendthrifts.  This has got to blow the MMTers away. The Modern Monetary Theory people understand the vast charade which is going on. All the concern about federal debt is nonsense investment in people and physical infrastructure is what will advance the Nation. Debt financed federal deficits is a policy choice it is an accounting convention of which we choose to abide.  As a sovereign nation with its own free floating currency the sovereign the U.S. in our case can create all the money it needs without taxation or borrowing taxation and borrowing are necessary however to prevent inflation in the goods services and asset markets (actually borrowing is never necessary but has other practical applications). With this in mind the U.S. can invest the necessary funds for a strong future nation restrained only by the inflationary impact of such investment. There will be a lag between the investment and the eventual supply of goods and services adequate to meet the additional money created through the investment. This is where the inflation comes in.  If you are worried about the current U.S. debt a large chuck of it $5.5 trillion or so sits on the Federal Reserve's (FEDs) balance sheet and it can be purchased by a platinum coin created by the Treasury Department's U.S. Mint or held in perpetuity by the FED where it is cost free to the U.S. taxpayer or simply extinguished through an Act of Congress in combination with the creation of a new FED intangible asset account to prevent the hit to the FED's balance sheet--a hit which would otherwise eventually pass to the U.S. taxpayer.  Higher government investment will need to crowd out private investment not for lack of investable funds which are virtually infinite but in order to prevent inflation due to excessive investment demand. This of course is why the social infrastructure package is resisted it would be an enlargement of government at the expense of the private sector but I would argue for the benefit of the people and the Nation at large.  The Nation does not need more private sector investment which churns out $15 an hour jobs alongside a growing class of billionaires and millionaires: Elon Musk--$306.5 billion Jeff Bezos--$192.9 billion Warren Buffett--$104.7 billion . . . . The Nation needs investment in human capital which will create good paying jobs and to better distribute corporate gains among the poor and lower middle income groups whose dire straits are the result of an over reliance on the private sector.,political,Facebook

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - Last week U.S. Steel announced the cancellation of an important investment in Allegheny County citing permit delays from the County that ultimately gave steel manufacturers in another state an advantage. Out of touch political leaders in Allegheny and state governments are blaming U.S. Steel for the failures of their bureaucracy. If we want a dynamic workforce and a flourishing local economy we need a similarly dynamic and responsive local government. The delays and excuses of Allegheny County Health Department and activists are unacceptable and ultimately cost upwards of 1000 jobs.  We have to get beyond this false choice of environmental protection and economic prosperity. The workforce of Allegheny County is ready to be a leader in responsible sustainable manufacturing practices. But it requires local leadership to answer the phone when workers need help. It is clear Allegheny County Council and Councilwoman Anita Prizio failed to pick up the phone and provide that leadership.  I know how important it is to listen to answer the phone to work with people to find solutions that benefit everyone not just special interest groups on either side of the political aisle. If you want a county council and a councilwoman who provides the leadership necessary to keep Allegheny County moving forward I ask for your support.,political,Facebook

My name is Amy Hoogstraet (HOOK-strat) and Im thrilled to announce that I'm running for city council in Nixas first district. This is my official campaign page. You might know me on Facebook as Amy Jane Hoogstraet Safley but for campaign purposes Im using my legal last name. Id like to introduce myself and tell you why I want to serve you on Nixas city council. This is a very long post but I wanted to give you as much information about me as I could in order to help you in deciding if I'm the candidate for you. I hope that you'll take the time to read the whole post!  I grew up in Springfield where I graduated from Drury University. After marrying a soldier I spent 20 years away from the area but it was always ""home"" and I finally returned in 2017. My husband and I chose to make our home in Nixa because we loved the small town feel and were very impressed with the schools and we are so happy with our decision! We feel that Nixa is our home and we have no plans to go anywhere else. We have a 16-year old son and a 6-year-old daughter and a fabulous miniature poodle named Sam.  After holding various interesting jobs I left the workforce to become a stay-home mom which is a move I have never regretted. As my youngest has gotten a bit older and more independent and since moving to Nixa I have finally realized my dream of becoming more involved in volunteering advocacy and helping others however I can. This sounds clich but honestly helping others and finding solutions to problems are my passions. And when I commit to something I'm ALL IN!  I am on the board of directors of GLSEN-Springfield which supports and advocates for LGBTQ youth and I also volunteer with PROMO an organization which fights discriminatory legislation in Jefferson City. A defining moment for me and one in which I learned how much I love being involved in government was when I went with PROMO to the Capitol in Jefferson City to speak with legislators there. I was completely in my element and I was good at it  I was hooked! Additionally I founded and am administrator of the Facebook group Nixa MO Diversity Advocates which seeks to celebrate support welcome and educate about diversity. I believe that in diversity (in ALL of its forms!) lies great strength richness and depth and I am very passionate about being a voice for those who are under-represented and fighting for equal rights for all.  Another experience which crystallized my love of civic/government involvement was when I had the honor of serving on Nixas Strategic Planning Advisory Committee this past summer and fall. The committee was comprised of volunteers from the community and was tasked with culling through public feedback and listening to subject matter experts in order to come up with Nixas next five-year strategic plan. It was a lot of hard work and I loved every minute of it! Working with a varied group of people who had a lot of different opinions and priorities but who all agreed that they wanted what was best for our community was exciting and challenging and I not only made valuable contributions to the process but also grew from it. This experience left me feeling sure that I wanted to continue my involvement with local government and with helping to bring the five-year strategic plan to fruition. Its a wonderful ambitious plan and Im very proud to have contributed to it. Im excited to see what we can accomplish in the next 5 years and the amazing ways in which Nixa can grow and improve! My work on the committee along with attending city council meetings has shown me how much grey area there can be in issues involving a city and its residents and I really enjoy the challenge of working within that grey area to find solutions. With my history of volunteerism advocacy collaboration and leadership along with my involvement in the strategic plan joining our city council feels like the next logical step for me and Im incredibly excited at the thought of serving my community in this way!  Why should you vote for me? I believe that my experience on the committee and my prior involvement in the strategic plan puts me in a perfect position to pivot right into city council. I have made valuable connections and have a great rapport with several of our council members and city administrators and feel comfortable working with them. Im continually impressed with our citys administration and would be honored to serve alongside them! As someone who contributed to the five-year plan I am very committed to helping see it through in a way that offers the most benefit to our community. I believe that my education and experiences have equipped me to work confidently yet humbly with others and to look for commonalities and ways to compromise to come up with good solutions to tricky problems. I am a very logical analytical thinker who naturally looks at problems from all angles and perspectives and can think outside the box when needed. I am level-headed and feel comfortable interacting with people even when they disagree with me. Im not given to knee-jerk reactions but rather to thorough consideration of all viewpoints. Im not running with any single agenda  I simply honestly love Nixa and want to help it be the best town it can be. I believe that with a great governing body Nixa can continue to grow be progressive and innovative and stay a leader in the region while still remaining true to its small-town roots. I also believe that the more diverse city council is the stronger it will be and Id love to help further diversify our council by becoming the second woman on the current council. I want to continue to be a voice for those who may not have one and for ALL members of this town I love. I want to see Nixa be as strong as it can be to help build bridges and to unify us while doing my best to make thoughtful decisions with the greater good of the community ever-present in my mind. I truly believe that despite our differences we all have much more in common than we may realize and we all want whats best for our community.  The bottom line is this: I love Nixa I want to help improve my community and build on what is already amazing about it and I believe that my skill-set makes me uniquely qualified to be a valuable member of city council. If elected I pledge to do my absolute best to serve you and I will always be accessible to my constituents. I am an excellent communicator and will be sure to keep the lines of communication open share what is happening and seek feedback from my constituents.  So please consider voting for me! I would greatly appreciate it if you would like and follow my page and share share share! If you dont live in district 1 share my page with friends who do and help me get elected so that I can bring continued progress vision and collaboration to Nixa! Thank you for your time.  Stay tuned  in future posts I will talk about some of the plans and goals for Nixa that are most important to me! And Im always eager and happy to answer any questions you may have.  Please remember that if you support my campaign the single biggest thing you can do to help me is to SHARE MY PAGE (or even a particular post from my page) ONCE A WEEK until the election to like my page and to invite your local friends to like it. The only way that I can win is to reach enough voters in District 1 and convince them to vote for me and for that I need your help! I won't be asking for monetary donations for this campaign - only for a minute of your time each week to help spread the word. :) Thank you!",political,Facebook
City of Taft Exploring Funding Options to Replace Lost Income from planned state closure of Modified Community Correctional Facility and closed Federal Correctional Facility.  By Jerry Livingston  The eventual closure of the Citys Modified Community Correctional Facility (MCCF) as well as the recent closure of the Federal Correctional Facility has motivated the City of Taft to consider all possible funding sources to replace over 2 million dollars lost in general funding generated by both facilities. As a result of the Citys due diligence in exploring all funding options available it commissioned a polling firm to explore the possibility of placing a one percent sales tax on a future ballot. Taft City Manager Craig Jones told the Taft Independent that the City commissioned the poll and stressed that the poll is just one of a number of explorations the City will go through to try to cover the future short fall. Jones stated that the City has worked hard to place itself on a more conservative fiscal footing since the previous closer of the MCCF. We have managed to reduce our staffing by 15 positions since 2012 by combining jobs. Our staff has taken on extra responsibilities as a way to help manage our costs each time we have had an employee reassign or retire. We have not had to lay off workers and I believe our level of service has been maintained. Taft is fast approaching a point were trimming the budget combining jobs and avoiding layoffs will not suffice to keep the Citys budget stable as just one example the cost of fire and paramedic services provided by the County will likely double in the next five years at some point the City will either need to find ways to fund this service or suffer a cut back such as longer response times for delivery fire and paramedic services. Further concerns are raised by the States out of control Retirement system that is sinking city budgets all over the state. Taft Mayor Dave Noerr has consistently highlighted the damage the retirement system has done to the Citys ability to fund local services. The States continual attacks on the Oil Industry also threatens to reduce income from property taxes paid by the industry to almost all of the areas local government and special districts. Jones also noted that Taft is one of the few cities that does not have a sales tax. If you work and shop in cities such as Bakersfield Delano Arvin Ridgecrest and Wasco you will pay a sales tax of 8.25% while Cities such as Rosamond and the portions of Bakersfield that are in the County of Kern along with the cities of Tehachapi and Shafter all have a sales tax of 7.25%. A sales tax is fairer than other forms of taxation because it allows the City to capture funds from persons who pass through the city to and from work in the oil fields. The need to maintain services for these transient visitors to our community can be partially offset by a sales tax that captures purchase made at restaurants and other local business. Jones stressed that the poll currently being conducted is a way for the City to gauge the likes and concerns of the Citys voters who will have the final say on any proposed sales tax.,political,Facebook
Hey everyone! The election is now just 3 short weeks away! In these last weeks it is crucial for me to reach as many district 1 voters as possible. Please help out by sharing my campaign page and telling your neighbors and friends in district 1! I am so appreciative of your support and help and if elected I will work as hard as I possibly can on your behalf.  The Christian County Headliner reached out to all of the city council candidates with 5 questions for us to answer. These answers will be published in the newspaper but I'm not sure when. In the meantime I thought I would go ahead and share my answers here:  1. List any relevant qualifications or experiences you would like voters to know about:   I am an active and well-known volunteer leader and advocate in the area (with PROMO GLSEN Free Mom Hugs Nixa MO Diversity Advocates etc.) and already have working relationships with members of the city council and administration the police department the school administration and board and other city leaders. In addition I was a member of the Strategic Planning Advisory Committee which crafted Nixas next 5-year strategic plan. As such Im invested in the plan and eager to be a part of its implementation. With my previous and ongoing civic involvement in addition to my body of experience and skills serving my community on city council is the next logical step and one Im very passionate about taking!   2. What action if any should the Nixa City Council take in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic or in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19?   It seems like Nixa has been doing a good job already of slowing the spread and I believe that with the availability of the vaccine theres light on the horizon. Were not out of the woods quite yet though and we must take care to avoid a resurgence. I believe that wearing masks and physical distancing in addition to getting vaccinated are still the best steps we can take over the next few months. Once the current mask mandate is ended I think that the best thing council can do is to continue to encourage (and serve as an example to) Nixans to wear masks and physically distance and to get vaccinated when eligible. I believe that businesses should remain open and some events should start to take place again with proper precautions in place. And the more of us who are vaccinated the sooner we will all be able to get back to normal.   3. What is your opinion about the level of accessibility that the Nixa City Council has with the general public?   I believe that council has done a great job of being accessible and transparent. Meetings are always posted on the citys website as well as social media and agendas are available to the public ahead of time so that residents can plan ahead as far as attending or speaking at meetings. District 1 council member Jarad Giddens has been very proactive about keeping his followers informed on social media and our citys Director of Communications Drew Douglas goes above and beyond to disseminate information. All that said there is always room for improvement and the citys 5-year plan includes a website overhaul as well as the creation of an interactive app for residents. There are also plans to create a virtual streaming platform for city council meetings for those residents who cant attend in person. Im excited about these changes and think that they will move the city to a whole new level of accessibility!   4. Is there an area of city government that you hope to develop advanced knowledge of in the future? If yes describe.   I cant necessarily point to one single area as Im fascinated with all of them! I want to learn as much as possible and plan to do so while continuing my civic involvement whether or not Im elected to council. Most issues are not black and white but rather have a lot of grey area and I really enjoy the challenge of working within that grey area to find solutions. In attending city council meetings and listening to ordinances being debated and residents speaking about issues I have consistently noted that there are usually valid points on both sides of an issue. Much of the time decisions made by the council will make one group of people happy and one group unhappy - thats a very tough spot to be in! But its this process of weighing pros and cons and figuring out which solution would best serve the greater good which intrigues me and which I think Im very well-suited for. Im a logical thinker who is very detail-oriented analyzes problems from all angles and thinks outside of the box when necessary. In addition I feel that I have a strong ability to empathize with others  to put myself in their shoes. Many issues brought before city council would not affect me personally but that doesnt mean that I wouldnt care about them or take them seriously. I believe strongly that part of being a contributing member of society is recognizing that something shouldnt have to affect you personally for it to matter to you  we should all care about each other. My great passions in life are problem-solving and helping others and as a member of council I would be able to put those passions to work and be a voice for ALL Nixans.   5. What level of involvement should Nixa have in partnering with other local governments such as Ozark and Christian County and with regional economic development groups? Why?   I believe that Nixa should have the highest possible level of involvement in partnering with other local governments and regional economic development groups and from what I have seen so far I think that it strives to do so. Nixa does not exist in a bubble and cannot possibly thrive unless it works in concert with other local governments and agencies. Nixa Ozark and Christian County as a whole share the same issue of being bedroom communities  our residents may live here but a great majority of them work in another municipality. This presents unique challenges to our economies and there is much to be gained by working together to address these challenges share ideas and collaborate in creating solutions. It can be tricky for a bedroom community to find a good balance between supporting local small businesses (We have some really wonderful small businesses here!) and welcoming new businesses which will bring more money and jobs thereby boosting the economy and infrastructure and better balancing the tax burden. Im eager to be a part of finding and maintaining that balance.,political,Facebook
Let's rebuild North Lake Charles into a better place to live learn WORK and play.  WORK  Strengthening the workforce and establishing a platform that empowers businesses to engage create and sustain a purpose-driven culture where employers and employees can succeed in our community is a must. We as a community must understand that mainstream companies are hesitant to open in our community in its current state for fear of compromising their bottomline. We must utilize small businesses as a transitional tool to attract businesses that will plant seeds of employment opportunities in our community so that we can grow into a place where people want to reside and work for years to come. As residents of the North Lake Charles community we must foster a culture of renewal by activating awareness in the importance of searching securing and sustaining jobs.

"So chairman at the time Chris Voccio believes this budget presented was good for taxpayers in the city? Senior services were eliminated youth services were eliminated AND property taxes were raised. Jobs were eliminated in departments that directly provide services to taxpayers. NO amendments were made or even proposed? ANY tax increase is not in the best interest of taxpayers! He claims to be ""a strong voice for taxpayers and consistently stands up for taxpayers"" but as council chairman with a republican majority did not propose one piece of legislation that benefits taxpayers. Every year since he has been elected to city council taxes have been raised and services have been cut! He voted ""yes or no"" but proposed no alternatives!

The City of Ridgeland Welcomes Southern Beverage Company  Ridgeland MS. (May 25 2021)  The City of Ridgeland Madison County Economic Development Authority (MCEDA) and officials from Southern Beverage Company announce the companys plan to build a new distribution facility. The 184000 square foot modern distribution facility will be located at Highland Colony Parkway and will bring 200 jobs with an average annual wage of $48000 to Madison County.  We are delighted that Southern Beverage Company chose Ridgeland as their newest Mississippi location said Gene McGee Mayor of the City of Ridgeland. We welcome them to our city and would like to express our gratitude for their investment in our community. The Highland Colony 220 Business Park is a prime location for businesses.  The Madison County Board of Supervisors is excited to welcome Southern Beverage Company to Madison County said Karl Banks Madison County Board of Supervisors President. We are excited about the growth this project brings to the county and appreciate the leadership MCEDA provided to help bring this project to fruition.  This project helps us to better serve our customer demand said Theo Costas Jr. Owner and President of Southern Beverage Company. Through the years Southern Beverage has strategically grown throughout Mississippi and this new facility helps position us for the future.

PASS Parents and Friends  (Dan here shaking my head a bit.)  There is a story circulating in certain irresponsible quarters that suggests the School Board duped the Board of Supervisors into level-funding SCPS within the current year by suggesting that failure to do so would risk SCPS eligibility for certain federal money. We at PASS cant respond to all the inaccurate things people say about SCPS  we already have full-time jobs  but this one seems worth addressing.  As regular readers of this page will recall the American Rescue Plan contained language (Section 2004) that conditioned eligibility for federal funds on something called Maintenance of Equity (MOE) that required that schools not cut local funding for schools that serve large portions of low-income or minority students. The statute did not define those terms leaving it instead to the U.S. Department of Education to do so. Schools which failed to meet the MOE requirements would not receive ARP funds.  Back in April when the budget was being considered no guidance had been forthcoming from the Department of Education about how they would interpret the MOE language. The point made by PASS and others was that if the BOS made significant cuts in local funding certain possible interpretations would make SCPS ineligible for $8 million in federal money.  The bombshell that supposedly proves that argument untrue is a table from VDOE from March that shows allocations of ARP Education funds among different school divisions in the state and shows  no surprise -- $8 million for SCPS. Heres the thing  everyone knew that  where do they think we got that number in the first place? But again only school divisions that comply with MOE requirements are going to receive the funds laid out in that document.  The only think like MOE that SCPS has had to deal with in the past is the Maintenance of Effort requirements on federal funds for special education. Under maintenance of effort if a locality cuts what they spend on special education that locality loses access to federal funds. The point is federal dollars are supposed to supplement local investment in education not replace it. SCPS did ask VDOE for clarification on what MOE meant and VDOE declined to provide it.  The guidance from the Department of Education came out last week. The first sentence in that 22-page document is: Section 2004 of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARP Act) includes new MOE) provisions that are a condition for a State educational agency (SEA) and local educational agency (LEA) to receive funds under the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ARP ESSER) Fund. That was exactly our point.  Ill be honest  from my cursory read of the document it doesnt look to me like Shenandoah would have lost federal money under the cuts. The guidance is more focused on not cutting more money for certain schools (low-income minority etc.) than other schools within a division. I cant say for sure. But nobody could have known that back in April. The Department could have interpreted it lots of ways and SCPS includes a lot of low-income and minority kids  particularly Hispanic kids. As one Supervisor put it we dont want to play poker with $8 million.  Cutting $3 million from the local contribution was a bad idea for a lot of reasons. Teacher raises would have been impossible. Extracurriculars would have been cut deeply. State matching money would have been lost. Even if we got the federal money it can only be used for certain things and FFA isnt one of them. It would be setting up our new Superintendent for failure. That would be the best-case scenario. I think by the time of the vote the majority of Supervisors realized that even this best-case scenario wasnt desirable and wouldnt have cut $3 million anyway.  The worst-case scenario would have been all of those things plus the loss of $8 million federal dollars. Nothing about that table from March proves otherwise.  Dan Walsh,political,Facebook
As I have had meet and greets been out in the community block walking etc. I have been asked about my campaign slogan The Right Choice. And while some folks are trying to inject politics into a non-partisan race by calling themselves the Conservative Choice and appealing to an extreme group of voters in order to get elected I choose to appeal to everybody! So my slogan means that I am not the conservative choice Im not the liberal choice Im the right choice to continue to lead District 5 !  I didnt get involved to push an agenda nor was it because I was disgruntled with the district. I got involved because first and foremost I enjoy being around our kids at all levels. I didnt just start attending events throughout the district I have been doing that for years. Sports plays & fine arts performances PTA events award ceremonies INSIDE community events etc. I support our district and got involved in order to help improve and advocate for all of our children as I consider all 41k+ students part of my extended family. That includes our teachers administration and superintendent.  As part of a high functioning board when you start injecting politics into decision making instead of keeping the main thing the main thing - which is what is best for all students and if the teachers have the proper resources to do their jobs then you will see a noticeable decline in the district! I appreciate all of the support phone calls emails discussions questions (thankful that people are willing to listen) and overall conversations as those who know me will tell you that I love to engage! ,political,Facebook
 THANK YOU NURSES - NATIONAL NURSES DAY 2021  In recognition of National Nurses Day which is today May 6 2021 Marlene would like to express her gratitude to all the nurses out there who work hard to take care of all of us and our loved ones in some of the worst times of our lives.  In the best of times being a nurse is one of the toughest jobs demanding the ability to put others first at all times. Nurses are expected to multitask deliver meds and treatments without error anticipate the needs of patients and residents work long hours oftentimes without enough support staff and somehow manage to do all of this while keeping a smile on their faces.  This year perhaps National Nurses Day should be considered even more special because this past year has been anything but the best of times. The pandemic added even more challenges onto already stressed nurses by making them complete their jobs without always having the protective equipment they needed to keep themselves and those they were tasked to care for safe. Still most stood tall and persevered and continued to give quality care many times having to give a little more to patients and residents who had to face life and death situations without even the comfort of a loved one or friend nearby.  Marlene Sebastianelli is proud to work alongside nurses as she has for many years in long-term skilled nursing care and she is grateful for all you do everyday to keep people safe and healthy.,political,Facebook
Frankly Speaking Why Change? The Town of Ontarios Comprehensive Plan is the guiding document for land use decisions capital investments operational changes and other issues. This planning for the future and the change it will bring is important because it establishes a vision for the communitys goals and objectives over the next 10 to 20 years. A plan for a successful future. We have seen tremendous growth since the 2006 Comprehensive Plan that has changed the landscape of the community. Over the past three years we have added over $90 million in commercial & residential growth. The only thing constant in life is change. If youre not challenging yourself to change and move forward the world will pass you by. Embracing change is an opportunity to improve or try new things. You can either be positive or you can be negative it will happen regardless. Therefore you need to be positive and able to adapt. Technology the economy demographics population growth market trends and consumer attitudes are always changing and they affect our community whether we like it or not. Abraham Lincoln would say the best way to predict the future is to create it yourself. Towns that have a vision for the future will always be more successful than towns that just accept whatever comes along. This past year is a great example of why it is important to embrace change especially in the rapid advancement of technology. During the pandemic all of us experienced the demanding need to embrace change at work and home and adopt digital technology as a way of life. Most things that touch our lives are changing; energy transportation food and the way we work. There are autonomous vehicles sensor-based Smart Traffic Networks drones that carry packages etc. 3-D printing and artificial intelligence replacing routine jobs. Change is an opportunity to improve or try new things. How is Ontario embracing change? Through the installation of LED lights Smart Cities Route 104 transportation study updating the comprehensive plan for the first time in 16 years updating old policies to reflect the times electrical vehicle charging stations with plans to add electric vehicles in the near future our new website gives us the ability to share information faster and sign up for auto notifications. The list goes on. We are looking at using technology to improve customer service giving residents the ability to conduct business with the town from the comfort of their home. My goal is to do this within every department of the town. Using our website you can get information on all building codes current policies and procedures many have been updated over the last three years and this is just the start of the change that I would like to see happen in the future. We are having all documents scanned that will be available through a searchable database. Using more and more technology will lead to increased satisfaction increased efficiencies and improved customer service while reducing the cost of doing business. Currently you must show a survey location of your project and physically drop off the application for a building permit. Imagine being able to pull up your property data a survey and plot where you want a shed or a pool or a deck fill out the form online and press a button to submit it to the Building Department. Thats what I will be advocating for and working towards for the future. The time to prepare for the future is now. We must constantly challenge ourselves to improve services become more efficient and offer services that residents want and need along with continuing to offer the lowest tax rate in the area. A quote by John Beckley that I have lived by is Most people dont plan to fail they fail to plan. Every community has naysayers. Whatever leaders propose to do some people will always say you cant do that it wont work it costs too much. No is a very powerful word but yes is more powerful. Yes we can make this town a better place to live in to work in to visit. A pessimist sees difficulty in every opportunity I see an opportunity in every difficulty.,political,Facebook

Hello Washington Township residents: over one third of you have voted already. Thank you! For those who have not and are still undecided consider the following.  Over the past several months I have outlined our vision and priorities for Washington Township that vastly differentiates us from the other candidates. Our plan To Make Washington Township Premier AgainTM is BOLD BUT ACHIEVABLE.  So why vote for me and the Premier team? I will leverage my leadership skills to help our community thrive once more. While we remember the Premier Community Washington Township once was we will look to the future to create a new Washington Township 2.0 together. I am new to politics and bring a fresh perspective. I am an ordinary citizen just like you who wants to bring common sense solutions to very solvable problems. What differentiates us is our ABILITY TO EXECUTE as opposed to just talking about and complaining about our problems as the Democrats and Independent candidates do. We focus on results!  I ask for your vote.  A vote for the Democrats is a vote for the same old generational institutional corruption that has plagued Township for years. When jobs become available in Township we will publicly post them and not require applicants to change political parties. We will not be patting ourselves on the back for simply doing our jobs (paving streets keeping up with maintenance in the parks); that is our day job. We will never use taxpayer dollars for political purposes. We will create a new culture in the municipal building to better serve YOU. We will not be complicit with tax increases from the county and state and work to right-size the Education tax. We will keep the municipal tax flat. We will stand up for YOU.  A vote for the Independent candidate is a vote for the Democrats. He does not have the experience nor temperament/personality to do the job. He has been ostracized from the WT Republicans due to financial shenanigans and his my way or the highway bullying personality. He was elected as a Republican in 2010 and served 4 years on Town Council. He accomplished nothing. He routinely abstained from crucial police resource votes and spent like a drunken sailor aligning himself with the Democrats. The Premier team does not traffic in half-truths as he does with his video rants and fake account surrogates. Statistically Independent candidates do not win in Washington Township (or in any election for that matter).  The Democrats and the Independent candidate do not have a vision for Township; nor do they have the ability to execute. We need change. Vote for The INTEGRITY & LEADERSHIP of the Premier Team of Spinelli for Mayor Bennett and DellaPia for Township Council AND ALL OF THE REPUBLICANS IN COLUMN A.,political,Facebook
A Liberal Explains the Cause of High Gas Prices Forget the fact that Joe Biden killed the Keystone Pipeline deal and cost the U.S. thousands of jobs and forget that he put a moratorium on all new oil and gas leases on federal land and offshore waters. Dont think about how he is suffocating domestic oil production with mandates such as establishing comprehensive standards of performance and emission guidelines from existing oil and gas operations by September 2021 and ordering Texas to submit State Implementation Plan for Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) by January 2022. Of course these policies will make us no longer energy independent and U.S. oil imports are expected to rise 2 million barrels per day by 2030 and U.S. gross domestic product will be declining $700 billion during the same span but that is not why gas prices are rising. Neither is fact that U.S. oil production is expected to decline 230000 barrels a day in 2021. Right-wing nut job conspiracy theorists and QAnon will tell you that is reason gas prices are going up. Those people are spreading disinformation! They might even try to tell you how Joe Biden waived sanctions on Russias pipeline while at the same time pulling the plug on our own Keystone pipeline which infuriated one of our strongest allies in Canada. While he did give our Russian enemy the same thing he took away from our neighboring Canadian allies that is not why gas prices are high. And dont think about how he hamstrung domestic oil production then recently turned around and asked OPEC to produce more oil instead of figuring out a way for the U.S. to produce more oil even though he ran on an America first platform. His inconsistent messaging and terrible policies have nothing to do with the high price of gas. That is nothing more than a right-wing conspiracy being spread by unsophisticated xenophobic white supremacists. These people probably want you to think about his rhetoric during the 2020 campaign when he called Saudi Arabia a pariah state with no redeeming social value only to see Saudi Arabia retaliate immediately after Joe Biden took office by committing to unilaterally cut 1 million barrels of oil. People spreading disinformation want you to believe that they did this to pressure Joe Biden into not penalizing Saudi Arabias crown prince Mohammed bin Salam for directly approving the killing of Jamal Khashoggi the Washington Post columnist who was drugged and dismembered in 2018. They probably also want you to believe it worked too and how Joe Biden did nothing to hold Mohammed bin Salam accountable for fear of upsetting U.S. Arabian allies. Some people might even argue that he failed on the humanitarian front by not seeking justice for the killing of an American citizen and he also failed on an economic front as well by allowing himself to be bullied by the Saudis. Even though this is a blatant lie let's just say he did fail on multiple fronts by not taking a clear position on that foreign policy decision. So what? That is not the reason gas prices are going up. In fact none of Joe Bidens terrible policies or bad decisions have anything to do with the price of gas today. Any expert will tell you that it is physically impossible for Joe Biden to cause a rise in the price of gas. Follow the science. All the data suggests that a man who wears aviator shades and eats ice cream could never screw anything up so bad that gas prices could rise 50% in just 8 months. It is metaphysically impossible. Blaming Joe Biden for the rise in gas prices is nothing more than a wild conspiracy theory. The real reason that gas prices are so high today are because of one man and one man alone. DONALD J.

Hi guys! Its Kim again and Im here to tell you a few things more about Craig since he hates touting himself I figured Id do it for him. Hes also asleep so he has no idea!   Craig has been working and paying taxes since the age of sixteen. He has a family that he has taken care of for 33 years. I think thats important when choosing an alderman because he knows what families in Petal want and need.  We didnt fool around when it came to raising our kids. They played baseball football golf tae kwon do and did Showchoir. Those things were expensive. We have fund raised and fund raised until finally they graduated! We also kept them involved in church. Asbury United Methodist has meant so much to us and our family. I cant stress this enough. So much so that one of our sons has married a future minister and hes in music ministry himself.  Being self sufficient and having life experiences like getting and losing jobs transferring around the country having children paying your own way are important when choosing a candidate. He knows what struggles you are going through because hes been there!  Hes worked for some great international companies like Procter and Gamble and G&K Services which is now Cintas. Those work experiences and the people he met and worked with were priceless in giving him the knowledge he needs to be successful in anything he does.  In my life I have never known anyone who works harder than him other than possibly my daddy. Ward 4 will be lucky to have him because he will be there when you need him. You will never have to worry about that. Thanks for taking time to read! I hope to meet you at the upcoming Meet The Candidates night on the 23rd. ,political,Facebook
"Dear Friends and Neighbors  As you may have guessed from all the yard signs I'm running for County Commission. Why? Because like many of you I think our community is heading in the wrong direction. Too many hotels are being built too fast. The out-of-control growth of tourism is having a negative effect on quality of life for residents. If elected I will put the interests of residents first.  Ive served on the county planning commission since 2017 and I played a significant role in Grand County's 2019 decision to hit the ""pause button"" on new tourist lodging. I will not need on-the-job training. I have the knowledge and experience to make things happen and get our community back on the right track.  Tourism is and will continue to be a major part of our economy. But we must manage tourism so that Grand County continues to be a great place to live for us full-time residents. If you prefer the ""anything goes"" approach to tourism which caused the problems we face today then I'm not your guy. If you want an experienced and resourceful commissioner who will prioritize the interests of Grand County residents and work toward smarter management of tourism then please consider voting for me.  For more details read on.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  About me. I've lived in Grand County since 1989  more than half my life. This is my home and I'm committed to making sure it remains a great place to live.  Efficient government. I crunch numbers for a living and I look forward to bringing my mathematical skills to bear on the county budget. It's important that at least a couple of commissioners are familiar with all the details of the budget. I've attended all of the weekly Budget Advisory Board meetings this year. These are the meetings where most of the county's spending decisions are made. If we want a competent and efficient county government then we need commissioners who will pay attention to budget details.  Economic diversity. Covid has taught us that it's not a good idea to put all of our economic eggs in the tourism basket. We don't want to be a one-industry town. But Covid also presents us with opportunities as people with portable jobs seek other places to live. One of many ways we can diversify our economy is to try to attract some of this newly mobile workforce. This will have spin-off effects that will benefit existing businesses in Grand County. To pursue this goal we need to make sure that Grand County remains a pleasant place to live which also benefits all of us who live here.  A smarter approach to tourism. We should aim to increase the dollars tourists spend here while also decreasing the disruption they cause. Any advertising we do should have these goals in mind. We need to make sure that tourism does not negatively affect residential neighborhoods. And we need to make sure that tourism does not drive up the price of commercial land and make it difficult for non-tourism businesses to get established.  Reasonably priced housing for residents. While on the Planning Commission I helped craft the ""High Density Housing Overlay"" program. This creates incentives for developers to build housing that is reserved for Grand County workers and is protected from competition from second homes and overnight rentals. It should create affordable housing for middle-income levels. 300 units have been approved and ground has already been broken for some of the projects.  I want to hear from you. Because of Covid I'm not able to go door-to-door and speak directly with voters. But it's still very important for elected officials to hear voters' concerns. This means a diverse cross-section of our community not just people who speak at public meetings. You can let me know what you think by filling out the short survey at .

The Alverez Marsal group known for hospital closures and responsible for many working class people to be jobless was hired by Currans team (through NIFA) to close down NUMC.  NUMCs Medicare feeder Nursing Home is A Holly Patterson which the A&M group and Bob Detor the Chairman of NUMCs board will suggest to be sold- per the report findings.  Medicare & Medicaid are only a small piece of what is being ripped away by limiting vital services private insurance payers are being driven away as well by drastic reductions in staff.  Our outside clinics known as NuHealth LIFQHCs should be sending all of its tertiary care needs to NUMC Bob Detor (LIFQ former chair) and David Nimeroff (Bob's business partner) made sure this does not happen. This is a plan to rid the hospital and all that are connected to it of Union Members (this FACT is in LIFQ meeting minutes of 2013) and is stated AGAIN & AGAIN in A&M report.  How is Union Busting not treated as the criminal action it is? Curran weighted the NUMC board in her favor no Union Member has a seat at the table over 3000 jobs are at risk.  There is no transparency WE have started an investigation of the board proceedings for information to proceed and Bob Detor David Nimeroff and Laura Curran for Union Busting.  THE A&M REPORT SUGGESTS THAT WE SHOULD TURN OVER ALL OUR BUSINESS TO LIFQ & BECOME BEHAVIORAL HEALTH - THE REPORT IS BASED IN LIES FRAUD AND THIS UNION HAS NOT NEGOTIATED ANY OF THIS!

Ive been gone a while but Im back. Im fired up. Quite frankly Im angry with several things that the state and country have been doing to damage this field at the moment.  I just got a job recommendation for a lead infant teacher job in San Francisco. They were offering an $15 an hour but required an Associate and a teaching permit and required continuing education. That is absolutely ridiculous and inappropriate.  $15 an hour is what I made when I first started working as an assistant teacher 5 years ago. That is when minimum wage was still $11.  What is more inappropriate is the amount of jobs as I looked through the recommended job list that were the same wage or $1-$2 more that is $30 k a year before taxes in a city that $100k is poverty level. This is for EDUCATED PROFESSIONALS.  30 miles out of that city high school retail associates and restaurants employees make that or more.  Why is Early Childhood Education continuously ignored when it is one of the most important jobs in our society? We LITERALLY shape the brains of children in THE most critical years of development.  While I do not believe that retail associates and restaurant employees should make less (everyone needs a livable wage) I DO believe that educated people working in their professional field should be able to earn their deserved pay.  Child care workers need to earn more. While the love of the children and the way that we are able to help families is so incredibly rewarding that can NOT be the only compensation in this field.  There are a lot of factors that prevent wage increase for child care workers (which I will write about later) but this is an important issue that needs attention desperately.

Hello Gibsonburg Parent or Ohioans!  Even though I am not on the Gibsonburg School Board and only just a candidate I want to keep you informed as I dont see the current Gibsonburg School Board saying anything on the following.  Parents WE ARE IN A FIGHT! Not just for ourselves but more importantly our Children.  HB111 stops public or private mandates requiring you receive or show proof of vaccination. This passed the House but then was failed to be considered in the Senate. The funds were rolled into a separate House Bill that left out the language that protects you from such mandates.  HB240 Parents Right to Know. Testimony for this that was to take place on Monday has been CANCELED. All committee meetings are canceled due to Budget! So they dont have the money for this but had money to bribe people to get vaccinated.  Though if you want to see your childs curriculum you can request this from the school under ORC 3313.60.  HB327 Stop Critical Race Theory. Still being talked about instead of being acted upon. Keep your eyes on this. I will update as I can. Also lets not forget the Comprehensive Sex Education that the schools have no business teaching OUR CHILDREN! Parents this is YOUR JOB! We have to start being parents as we should.  HB248 Vaccine Choice & Anti-Discrimination Act. Still being talked to death instead of being voted on.  These bills will hopefully pass the House and then go to the Senate where it seems they dont like to do their jobs. We need to keep our eyes on all of these as these will most likely affect our schools and children.  As a Gibsonburg School Board member I will fight hard for our children and the rights of the parents even if these Bills dont pass. We have to have schools get back to doing their job. That job is to Teach our kids. IT IS OUR JOBS TO BE THEIR PARENTS.  Please get out and vote Justin Chafin for Gibsonburg School Board on November 2 2021.

Tennessee Special Session Recap:  - Workers lose the right to sue for negligence over COVID.  - Sidewalk chalk and camping in public places is now a felony.  - You can be charged the same amount for a telehealth zoom conference as you would a regular office visit.  We could have:  - Expanded Medicaid becoming the 40th state today to do so joining our neighbors Arkansas and Kentucky.  - Passed a worker relief bill helping struggling families who have lost their jobs and/or wages.  - Put our $1BN rainy day fund to use by giving our teachers a $200/month COVID stipend to use for whatever they need. Maybe its PPE maybe its a webcam. Maybe it scented candles for them to relax at the end of a long week of meeting impossible demands from angry parents and an uncaring state legislature.  Its time to stop ignoring the real problems Tennesseans are facing and give hardworking taxpayers the help they deserve.,political,Facebook
I keep having people tell me. One of my opponents is telling folks not to vote for me. He tells people to only use one vote in this race when you have two votes for two open seats! Sad he cares only about himself. Not whats best for Caswell. Also they say one of my opponents tells county employees dont vote for that Dickerson guy or you will never see another raise. Wow!! What nerve considering they turned the county employees down for a 2% raise and then went back and approved it because of pressure during an election! Check the minutes for yourself. Folks if you keep voting incumbents back in office we will never get new ideas and better ways of thinking on the board! Truth is. I have lots Republican supporters lots of conservative supporters and I also have Democratic supporters that cross party lines. I definitely do not agree with the democrats on the National Democratic political agenda. We dont see eye to eye on the national issues. So we agree to disagree on national politics. But they understand that the vast majority of those issues are not controlled by the board of commissioners. Also they do understand that the local commissioners are the ones that set the property tax rates and control the local budget. All of us want a financially responsible person on the board helping make those decisions that impact their pocket book at the local level! They also understand that to improve our county services  internet infrastructure etc. And to continue to provide cost of living raises our county employees it requires tax money. And we have to diversify our tax base by bringing in new outside sources of revenue to do it. One way is Industrial economic development in our industrial parks that will bring new tax revenue and much needed jobs to Caswell. We have to stop hammering the citizens of Caswell with these ever increasing property tax hikes! So with many of my supporters it is strictly who is best suited to manage our county finances and decide local issues. Vote in a new person that will think outside to box and help make Caswell a better place! Vote John Dickerson for Commissioner. Early voting going on now until October 31st.,political,Facebook
I'm a homegrown New Englander that loves our Ocean State! I enlisted in the Army to protect families and to keep the country safe. I have overcome the stigma of being disabled and learned that even though I have lifetime injuries I would in a heartbeat do it again for the people. I am here to serve you again not as a combat soldier but as a concerned citizen who is running for the people so that we all can have a voice that will be heard!  I believe all life should be loved and cherished and at this point in time we need to be coming together not as party affiliations but as Americans. Our state country and way of life are being torn apart daily. There are some truly terrifying things happening in our country right now from violence in the streets to agendas that would attempt to destroy our country from within. We as citizens of Rhode Island need to be vigilant for our families and our homes.  There are people currently at the statehouse looking to raise taxes and most likely get their coffers filled. There are also candidates running here for District 71 who have announced that they would raise taxes! During a pandemic people have lost their jobs and homes not to mention those have passed due to this pestilence. People do not need tax increases right now; they need empathy some help but not a handout; they deserve to have a State Representative who actually gets it. I absolutely know how hard it is to survive and I will do everything in my power to fix this problem for everyone! GET OUT AND VOTE!!,political,Facebook
"Because Joe Biden insists on attacking the unvaccinated we now find ourselves at a place in history where Americans are cheering on the fact that their fellow Americans are being ostracized from everyday life. Even here in a red state like Texas where life liberty and property are supposed to be hallmarks of society every day we are seeing more and more Texans being removed from their jobs schools and other stations in life for simply making a health decision best fits their life situation.  And that divide only deepens when we see Biden and the democrats saying things like the unvaccinated people were ""not nearly as smart as I thought you were."" We see the media pushing narratives like blaming the unvaccinated for the continuation of the pandemic Biden's poor approval numbers hindering economic growth costing jobs and putting unnecessary strain on the healthcare system.  We now live in a country where our borders are being overwhelmed; consumer prices are nearing record highs inflation is quickly pushing us towards a recession employers cannot find help and spending is out of control. And the most common narrative being pushed out of the Whitehouse and in the media is that the unvaccinated are being labeled unemployable and are being ostracized from society so that we can protect the vaccinated from the unvaccinated because the unvaccinated refuse to get the vaccine that didn't protect the vaccinated in the first place.  Personal agency over our own lives is one of the most fundamental tenents of a free society. If you have chosen to be vaccinated because you believe it protects you and it is what's best for you then it shouldn't matter if others are vaccinated because you are protected. And if you are unvaccinated because you believe that it is your right to make healthcare decisions for yourself and your family then what someone else's healthcare choices are should be none of your concern. We have somehow found ourselves in this quasi-socialist communist place where too many Americans now believe the interests of society somehow trump those of the individual. Our nation was founded on the rights of the individual not those of the community. And if we desire to continue to remain a free society and have personal agency over our lives we must move away from this collectivist ideology and return to the ideology of individual rights spelled out by our founders which has served us well for nearly 250 years.  And it starts by electing people who are willing to stand up for you and fight for your individual rights. I will go to Austin to represent you! Not the special interest groups and lobbyists. Not some board I was appointed. And not some group I am a member of. We have enough of those in Austin.

While I very much prefer to quietly do what I do and since there are people here in Newton that have been asking friends about who I am and what my story is  I will take the time to share some of my story for those that think it might be relevant as it pertains to being a good commissioner.  I was a very happy positive kid. I seldom talk about my younger years publicly. I am one of 5 children that grew up in a 2-bedroom house. Me and my 3 brothers shared a room just big enough for 2 sets of bunkbeds. My dad built a walled area for my sister in an already small living room just big enough for a twin mattress for my sister. We had 1 bathroom for the 7 of us. The entire house was approximately 900 sq.  My parents are now both gone. Dad died 10 years ago and my mom just a couple of years ago. At the age of 7 mom lost her mother to an appendix rupture. At the age of 4 my father lost his mother in a house fire. My mom was shipped off to an aunt and raised by her. My dads father re-married and dad had a step-mother that was awesome.  My dad bought the Standard Oil gas station in Ulysses Ks in 1960. I loved that place. I spent every possible minute there with my father. When I was 6 I was able to wait on customers. Dad built a special set of steps so I could push it up to a car sit on the hood and wash windshields. I wasnt aware enough at the time that I was an advertising prop for dads business  back then all stations were full service  but people flocked to dads business in part because they liked being waited on by a little kid. I quickly learned how to take change and yes  how to count back change to a customer. I really think that started my interest in accounting. So I still do many of my own service station mechanic work as I learned how to fix tires change oil grease u-joints and many other related duties before I turned 10.  Dad worked himself sick in the gas station I really dont remember what illness he had  but he eventually sold the station in 1970 and went to work for the Standard Oil bulk gas distributor. He eventually left that job to drive a truck for the rural trash service in our area  and eventually retired from there. During this time dad became known as Mr. Little League and spent 40 years using baseball to provide a positive influence on the young people in Grant County.  I know that our family was poor. But back then I think everyone was some level of poor. I dont remember being poor  there were families that had big houses that obviously had more money than others  but back then with only 3 channels of TV we were outside all day playing baseball or some other sport when we werent working. I always had a job in high school  worked for the guy that bought dads station most of the time. My high school jobs also included roofing houses bucking bales moving irrigation pipe changing tubes out of an irrigation ditch driving a tractor rogueing milo and anything else that would put money in my pocket. There were just a few families that gave their kids an allowance if I wanted spending money I had to earn it myself.  With 5 kids and a set of parents in a small house  I was more than excited to be off to Garden City Community College after high school was complete. The summer before college I worked for a company that sold grain handling systems and I learned how to pour concrete driveways dump pits and cone pits. I also assembled grain bins and installed aeration systems learning how to weld in the process.  During that first college year I worked for the Butler Building dealer and worked evenings and weekends putting together transport augers and helping assemble buildings and grain bins. The summer after my freshman year in college the owner of the company let me pick my own crew and I erected buildings and bins working with 3 other friends for that summer.  Sophomore year I went to Southwestern College in Winfield. I stayed in the dorm that year and got a job at Gibsons Discount Center (think small Wal Mart). I stocked groceries and was in charge of the fish department. There were probably only 25 aquariums  but it seemed like there were a 100. I was always cleaning and testing aquariums. Constant battle with all the fish diseases but eventually found a rhythm where death loss went to a very acceptable level.  Sophomore summer I started my own roofing company. I had always been entrepreneurial  did lots of things to make money when I was a kid. I also got a summer job at Cities Service Gas company where I worked night shifts in a compressor plant. I had really long days. I would roof every morning until it got too hot to stay on a roof. Then sleep until 6:00pm and crawl back on the hot roof until dark. Then sleep until 11:00pm. Then get ready to go to my night shift at the compressor plant. I repeated this each week-day  roofing on weekends.  Went back to Southwestern for Junior year  and Junior summer repeated the roofing / compressor plant work in Ulysses. I got married that summer (1976) and the most difficult wedding picture we took after the ceremony was the one with Danas hand on mine  showing the rings we gave each other as a commitment to each other. Roofing is not friendly to your hands  getting her hand to cover my hand in a way it didnt look like I had just finished having a death battle with a grizzly bear was not easy.  I also worked my Junior and Senior year in College at Gibsons Discount Center  but added a school bus driving gig to it because I was able to work that into my class schedule.  I graduated from Southwestern College in 1977 with a Business Administration degree with an emphasis in accounting  Magna Cum Laude  with no school debt. My wife still had a year of school left so I looked for a job in Winfield where I might use my education but being too honest with potential employers  our intent was to go back to western Kansas after my wife graduated  kept me from working for any local CPA firm. I eventually applied at Peabody Corporation for a position in their assembly line shaping copper tubing that went onto combustion heating systems. That put my resume on file. I was later asked to move into their accounting department to cover for an employee that was having a baby. When she didnt return to work that became my entry into a full-time position in the accounting world.  We moved to Garden City in 1978 and I went to work with a CPA firm while my wife started her teaching career in Deerfield KS. I eventually moved to Ulysses and had my own firm which I sold in 1999. At the time of the sale I had 1300 clients in 37 states. I currently run a bioscience company that I started in the early 2000s.  I have never forgotten where I come from. I never miss an opportunity to mentor those that are willing to grow using my experiences. I had great mentors along the way. I still have a tremendous drive to good for the world because I know I have been blessed. My wife of 45 years and I have quietly been an influence in the lives of many. We believe that character is what you do when no one is looking.  The problem with local politics is that people have to run for office telling you they are going to fix things in order to get elected. You get to decide if you believe them and vote accordingly. The reality is that there is no quick fix to a problem that has evolved over decades of management (or mismanagement). The only real fix is a long-term pathway where you make a series of good decisions in all areas of city business. Everything ties together. Simultaneously you have to improve how you do economic development (grow your tax base) allow for improvements to your water and sanitation infrastructure get the right people in the right positions and pay them a competitive wage improve your downtown provide amenities that keep people in town provide for housing needs and a multitude of other things that keep a community viable and competitive with other communities.  No one cares about Ordinary Joe more than I do. I was raised by Ordinary Joe. I have not forgotten that people struggle  but I also know that the only way to fix this is to chart a path that keeps the community economically competitive long enough that we can grow our way into lower utility rates. Deviating from that path for short term relief is how we got into this predicament.  I want to continue working for all citizens of Newton. I have a clear understanding of the problem and things will get better if we all have the discipline to stay the course. We have already gone 4 years without a mill levy increase and longer than that without raising utility rates. Together we can do this. We really are on a very good path and I hope you will give me a chance to use my experience to stay the course when you vote on November 2nd.,political,Facebook
When I speak about development I don't mean turn Champion into a suburb. I mean create opportunities for entities that can pay taxes and relieve the burden or our property owners. I mean create jobs so people don't have to commute outside of Champion for employment. Champion is currently seen as anti-development and many companies won't even attempt to do business within our borders because of it. Just to have my bed and breakfast (promote tourism) I had to petition the Town Board to change the zoning law then had to attend a planning board meeting have a survey map altered and then attend a planning board meeting just to have my site plan referred to the County. We need rural development in order in to alleviate the tax burden on our tax payers. We shouldn't be so antidevelopment that Tractor Supply builds right over the Town and County line in Denmark. Right now we rely almost completely on our property owners and sales tax we receive from the County. This needs to change. We don't need a suburb to do it but we need development the time of relying on Ft Drum to sustain us has come to an end.,political,Facebook
"To all : President Trump was a great American patriot and leader. His presidency was everything but dictatorial. His leadership was compassionate and smart and good for the country despite all the fake propaganda and demonization by the democrats and the fake news media. He governed with love of country and an America First ideology and not of party and partisanship and corruption. He placed the interests of the American people first and foremost. He was smart in dealing with foreign powers friends and foes included and brought respect and dignity to America. He brought back jobs that had been lost forever and created the greatest economy in the history of the country with record employment and growth for all including every minority group. He did this despite the greatest slander misinformation collusion and multiple coup attempts against his Presidency and his character and his administration. He did this despite one of the worst pandemics in modern history and constant barrage of attacks by the democrats and their allies in the fake MSM and despite two hoaxes of an impeachment and Russian collusion hoax.He created a vaccine in record time when everyone of his opponents made fun of him and ridiculed him. operation ""warp speed"" has saved tens of thousands of lives  if not millions in this country and the world. He was falsely called a racist antisemite Hitlerian dictatorial and many other derogatory names all as part of the attempt to cheat him out of a second term which he won by a landslide and millions of more votes than the votes of his first term election.History is not subject to the manipulations and machinations of the corrupt few and time will be the ultimate rightful judge of this man and his love for his country and people. The swamp and the deep state won but the majority of The American people know the truth and will not allow it to continue to rule for long. Many have been fooled and misled but the awakening is here and The People will take over their country from the greedy and the corrupt and powerful. God has always watched over America and its people because despite all its flaws and all its shortcomings it is the most democratic country in the history of mankind and a force for good and benevolence. It is no wonder everyone is trying to come here from all over the globe and whether they come legally or unlawfully they never want to leave.

Press release from Congressman Aderholt.  We at Advance Etowah are hopeful that the small handful of people that can end this today will weigh heavily this statement and letter and understand that any further pursuit of this development is in direct opposition of the people most of the surrounding municipalities Senator Andrew Jones Representative Craig Lipscomb and a large percentage of the other elected officials in our county the FAA's recommendation and now even MORE CLEARLY our US Congressman. We will update you as we learn more.  PRESS RELEASE:  For Immediate Release: August 18 2021  Washington D.C.  Today Congressman Robert Aderholt issued the following statement after receiving a letter from the Federal Aviation Administration concerning a proposed poultry rendering plant at the Northeast Alabama Regional Airport.  This morning my office received the attached letter from the Federal Aviation Administration concerning the proposed poultry rendering plant for property at the Northeast Alabama Regional Airport in Gadsden. I had previously reached out to the FAA to convey concerns expressed by the public for this proposal. The letter from the FAA makes it clear that such a facility which they believe would attract wildlife would not be a good choice to locate on airport property.  While the FAA remains open to proposals for the plant I think any reasonable person who reads their letter can conclude a poultry rendering plant is not likely to get their blessing to go forward. I believe this effectively ends this proposal for the plant.  I am a firm believer in economic development and I stand ready to help anyone who wants to bring jobs to the Etowah County area. But any plans for bringing jobs should always have the support of the public and also needs to meet the demands and requirements of the property where it would be located.  The Honorable Robert B. Aderholt House of Representatives Washington DC 20515  Dear Congressman Aderholt: Thank you for your July 7 letter on behalf of State Senator Andrew Jones Representative Craig Lipscomb Advance Etowah and other concerned citizens regarding the proposed development of a Pilgrims Pride rendering plant on the property of Northeast Alabama Regional Airport (GAD) located in Gadsden Alabama.  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) received a number of emails from concerned pilots and local citizens regarding this proposed development. The Jackson Airports District Office shared similar concerns regarding the proposed development in a letter to the city of Gadsden on January 14. In the letter the FAA recommends a separation distance of 10000 feet between an airport serving turbine-powered aircraft (like GAD) and a hazardous wildlife attractant such as the proposed development. Furthermore the FAA recommends a distance of five miles between the closest point of the airports aircraft operations area and a hazardous wildlife attractant. A copy of that letter is enclosed for reference.  The FAA received a request for airspace review for the proposed development but rejected the request because it was filed incorrectly. The FAA believes that a corrected request for airspace evaluation is forthcoming. However the FAA analysis and determination of potential impacts to air navigation should not be considered FAA approval or a permit for the proposed development. Some municipalities require a favorable FAA airspace determination letter prior to issuing construction/building permits but the FAA does not issue permits for construction.  We recognize the public concern with this proposed development. The FAA has not received a formal request for the sale or the release of the property for nonaeronautical use. Under either alternative the FAA will duly complete a comprehensive review in accordance with the requirements of FAA Order 5190.6B Airport Compliance Manual and the terms of the surplus property quitclaim deeds associated with this property. This comprehensive review is a separate process and unrelated to the determination of potential impacts to air navigation referenced in the previous paragraph.  If you or your staff need further assistance please contact the Office of Government and Industry Affairs at (202) 267-3277.  Sincerely Shannetta R. Griffin P.E. Associate Administrator for Airports,political,Facebook
"MODERN MONETARY THEORY AND INFLATION  Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) offers a description of monetary operations which has drawn increased national attention over the past two decades. The proponents of MMT are mercilessly maligned by orthodox economists the press and others; their views are often badly distorted in various press publications.  MMT puts forth the idea that monetary sovereign nations: nations with their own free floating currencies are not budget constrained in their spending practices. Sovereign nations such as the U.S. which create their own currencies cannot possibly be constrained by funding issues as they create their own currency and there is no operational limit on the amount of currency which they can produce. There are practical inflationary constraints on a sovereign monetary authority's production of money but funding constraints are self-imposed and do not reflect the ability of a sovereign monetary nation to spend as appropriate on a nation's needs.  The mechanics for MMT go like this. When the federal government spends money enters into a checking account. This spending action has in effect and in reality based on definitional categories of money actually produced new money. When the federal government collects taxes or borrows it destroys money: it takes money out of the economy. There is no natural law which states that federal expenditures must equal taxation and borrowing. In other words the Federal government need not fund federal deficit spending with debt. This is a policy choice. Households must match that which comes in with that which goes out but governments which create their own currencies are not likewise constrained. The truth of these statements is readily demonstrated through an examination of the U.S. colonial period during which colonial governments spent currencies into existence. The North's use of Greenbacks during the Civil War provides another example of this practice.  Excessive money creation without adequate money destruction i.e. taxation and borrowing will create inflation in the goods services and asset markets. MMTers readily acknowledge this point. Inflation occurs in the goods and services sectors when expenditures exceed productive capacity or in MMT words when the economy bumps up against real resource restraints. This makes perfect sense. This is also where MMT gets badly misrepresented in the press as economists financial analysts and others make the outrageous claim that MMT promotes the view that the federal government can endlessly spend without inflationary consequences. A recent opinion piece in The Hill (March 30 2021) stated: ""For those unaccustomed with MMT in essence it states that the U.S. government can print and spend money limitlessly."" This is not the MMT view and the promoters of such a view generally reveal their lack of serious study of MMT or worse MMT views are cynically misrepresented in an effort to impose discipline on federal government spending.  While on this topic we should not allow the current system to escape criticism on the inflation front. The system's dependence on unemployment underemployment and low wages in order to preserve price stability create other inflationary forces which generally go unrecognized. These unrecognized inflationary forces include police prisons the U.S. military and other unproductive activities which do not directly add to the production of goods and services. Much of the need or perceived need for these services can be directly linked to low income conditions in large segments of the U.S. population. The U.S. military is included here as it offers employment to impoverished workers and it is a necessary appendage to the competitive and inherently expansionary nature of the capitalist system.  The unemployed require state support and it is right to provide this support; but these unemployed labor earnings combined with earnings from labor and capital which result from the nation's roughly $730 billion military budget and additional large earnings from employment in prisons police forces and so forth: all of which adds nothing to the production of goods and services puts upward pressure on the prices of these goods and services. To date countervailing deflationary forces have hidden these inflationary costs. Without consideration of these inflationary forces we immediately go to wage gains as the source of inflationary pressure. As nice as it would be to see a military budget of zero one has to wonder about the deflationary impact of such a budget. Nonetheless a demilitarized world is a worthy goal and it would be better to direct soldiers into productive rather than destructive activities.  Part of MMT's theoretical framework is a full employment federal jobs program which guarantees employment to any willing participant at a respectable minimum wage along with healthcare and childcare services. MMT correctly perceives that one of the major problems with the free market economy is there is a constant pool of unemployed underemployed and low paid labor which damages both the individual and the broader national economy. Under the MMT scheme the wage in the job guarantee program would effectively set the national minimum wage. During expansionary times the private sector would bid labor out of the job program and during recessionary times labor would fall back into the job program. The job guarantee would moderate economic cycles and build a productive national workforce.  MMTers generally believe there is much available space for federal spending before real resource capacity is fully utilized--the point at which inflationary pressures begin to build. There are examples which back their view. Japan has struggled with deflationary pressures since the 1990s. During the past decade Japan has gone on a money creation binge which has resulted in a national debt to GDP ratio which approaches 240% more than double the U.S. ratio of debt to GDP. Yet Japan's inflation rate still hovers around zero. In the U.S. despite vigorous efforts to the contrary the nation's central bank the Federal Reserve has been unable to achieve a 2% inflation target. Both of these examples demonstrate the strong deflationary forces present in the global economy: this provides space for expanded money creation.  Would a federal full employment jobs program have a long term inflationary impact? It is difficult to say. MMTers say no. To me the answer is not so clear. What is clear however is that if a ""healthy"" non-inflationary economy is dependent as it has been during previous decades on a pool of unemployed underemployed and low wage workers then the economy is either flawed in its design or we are using a wrong set of measurements. Current accounting measures facilitate private sector measurements of profits and losses but fail to account for the broader social gains and losses associated with such activity. We all know that full employment is better than non full employment. Yet inflation measures which are important for money supply management purposes have dictated a near constant state of unemployment. The possible exception to this general rule is WWII which essentially amounted to a full employment federal jobs program.  If inflation measures and private firm accounting practices which prevent full employment violate that which we know to be true i.e. full employment is better than unemployment then it is time to create new measurements and accounting practices which better reflect the reality of what is happening in the broader national economy.  MMT offers accommodation to capitalist national economies with free floating sovereign currencies. Capitalists ought to embrace MMT ideas because capitalism will not survive its current form. If capitalism does not embrace necessary reform one variant of which MMT represents the other direction involves increasing social discontent oppression and violence. Few people capitalist or non capitalist want to wander down this path.  If the MMT plan were put into place and it were to prove unworkable due to inflationary pressures then either a new set of measurements and accounting practices should be developed which reflect the broader gains achieved through a guaranteed full employment program or the economy would need other radical restructuring which ensures a decent standard of living for all people.",political,Facebook

Newly released immigration statistics which reported 15000 Haitian immigrants had entered the U.S. since he took office reportedly ignited President Trumps tirade. While the White House subsequently denied Trump had used the words AIDS and huts it did not deny the overall description of the meeting.  271.  June 2017  The Trump International Hotel in Washington D.C. received $270000 in payments from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for rooms catering and parking as part of a lobbying effort. This violates the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution which forbids government officials from accepting any present Emolument Office or Title of any kind whatever from any King Prince or foreign State. Donald Trump has retained an ownership interest in his businesses and thus could receive payments from foreign states. 239.

Learning a trade changed my life Career Technical Education can do the same for thousands more.  By Dane White  When I graduated from High School in 2007 in Panguitch Utah I was not able to afford college and my lifestyle choices had precluded me from pursuing a higher education at that time. I had previously experienced a rough upbringing and at 15 was sent to a boarding school. After spending 19 months there I ran away. I then spent the rest of my childhood lost homeless at times constantly in trouble with the law and eventually finding myself in juvenile hall awaiting placement in a foster home.  It was not a great period of my life but there was a silver lining: I was fortunate enough to pick up some basic skills. I could usually find some money by offering to help out my friends dad who happened to be a contractor. Typically that consisted of picking up trash at job sites holding the dumb end of a tape measure or silently watching the process of building a deck framing walls or finishing carpentry. Over time I picked up more skills like how to read a tape measure how to make basic cuts on a miter saw or table saw and how to shoot nail guns.  Shortly after my 18th birthday I was released from foster care. It was time to be an adult the best I knew how. I relied on those basic skills to find a job with a general contractor back in my hometown of Escondido. Since then I have refined those skills enough to become a successful laborer project manager foreman and even work on my own as a handyman. I enjoy being a craftsman and have learned to appreciate compliments like You have excellent attention to detail or Its evident you strive for perfection. This has brought a tremendous amount of self-worth and satisfaction into my life.  I find myself thinking back to those humble beginnings a lot now as I currently serve as the President of the Escondido Union High School Board of Trustees. From the beginning of my campaign up until now serving as President I have been motivated by how vital Career Technical Education and vocational training are to the community of Escondido. If students have an opportunity to learn even basic skills early on they have an opportunity to avoid some of those mistakes that I made and can have a head start at achieving a successful career and life. Escondido has phenomenal Career Technical Education (CTE) programs ranging from a renowned Culinary Arts program at Orange Glen wildly successful Agriculture programs at San Pasqual and Escondido High in addition to classes in Auto Welding and Wood Working.  These are real skills that translate to real jobs and have a real impact on students lives.  Which is why I was so disappointed a couple months ago when I discovered administrators in my district were planning on adjusting curriculum requirements to squeeze CTE programs off our freshman and sophomore agendas in favor of additional core-curriculum classes to expedite students on their pathways to graduation and college readiness.  This was not a nefarious attempt to cut our districts CTE programs. It was a genuine effort to keep our students on track. Yet it would have the effect of greatly reducing the number of Escondido students enrolled in CTE programs. Which meant that in my eyes the plan was entirely unacceptable.  Thankfully we had many of our districts passionate and dedicated CTE teachers and core-curriculum teachers voice their concerns to the Board of Education.  My message to those teachers: we heard you. I heard you.  We are committed to ensuring that each student is presented with CTE as an option in selecting their classes at each of our districts high schools.  However challenges lie ahead. The states proposed budget includes potential deep cuts to K-12 education and CTE programs seem to always be on the chopping block. Sacramento is currently engaging in the budget process and I remain hopeful that CTE funding remains intact for the coming school year.  These funding challenges in addition to declining enrollment in our district are forcing us to make tough decisions and get creative to balance budgets and maintain current levels of programming. And it is only going to get more difficult with time. But I also know that students who graduate with career-ready skills like I did are well positioned to find a good paying job and make a living for themselves and their families. I also know that CTE classes are often times the most fun part of our students days. These programs allow students to put down the pens and pencils close the textbooks and explore all the wonderful things they are able to do with their curiosity and creativity.  In Escondido Career Technical Education is not a program that can be cut when the budgets get tight schedules fill up or tough decisions need to be made. CTE is at the heart of our mission as a school district. I look forward to continuing to work alongside our CTE teachers and our districts leadership to make sure every one of our students has the opportunity to learn career-ready life changing skills at our Escondido high schools.  ###  Dane White was elected to the Escondido Union High School District Board of Trustees in 2016 and currently serves as Board President.

     Taunton MAToday Kelly Dooner candidate for Taunton City Council proudly announced that Mayor Shaunna OConnell has endorsed her candidacy.  We have worked hard over the past year to move Taunton forward. It is important to me that we have leaders who want to work for the greater good of the people. Kelly Dooner shares that same vision. Which is why I am proud to endorse her candidacy said Mayor OConnell.  Mayor OConnell was sworn into office in January of 2020. With less than 100 days in office our city was hit with the pandemic. Despite the new challenges OConnell was able to work with the City Council to implement many reforms.  Mayor OConnell has done an outstanding job for the people of Taunton. I am thrilled and honored to have her endorsement said Dooner. On the Council I will follow in her footsteps to make positive changes that will move our city forward.  Like OConnell Dooner supports funding a new public safety building and giving our police the tools they need to do their job.  I am going to raise a family here. It is imperative that our children and seniors are safe in our neighborhoods added Dooner.  Dooner has received several major endorsements for her City Council race including Rosemary Heath and City Council President Chris Coute.  Dooners platform includes: Reviving the local economy and helping grow local jobs; Strengthening public safety; Keeping Taunton affordable; Helping seniors and veterans; and Transparency the people come first.,political,Facebook
When I look out into the streets of New York City I am ashamed of the politicians who have destroyed our city.  Do you want to take back your city? Help me with a donation here: https://secure.anedot.com/mateo-the-mayor/save_nyc_fb  Streets that were once vibrant and full of energy are now lifeless with vacant storefronts. Both small and large businesses are struggling to survive and many are leaving for better opportunities elsewhere.  Crime has risen to unfathomable levels as a result of the Radical Left's rhetoric and policies. Felons are praised while law enforcement is demonized and our streets are no longer safe for our children.  New York City used to be a place that the rest of the world looked up to. Now it is a model of what not to do. People are doing whatever they can to leave and I must admit even I thought about doing the same.  Instead I decided to run for Mayor and do the hard work our current politicians won't do to fix New York City.  If you're with me if you want to take back YOUR city please make a donation to help our campaign today:  Now more than ever New York City needs a leader with a backbone. A leader who will stand against the Radical Left and stand WITH New Yorkers.  We must overhaul the failed policies running our city into the ground.  We must incentivize businesses to return and create jobs.  And we must restore law and order to our streets. I will unapologetically stand with our officers in the NYPD!  If you care about fixing New York City then please consider donating to my campaign today. Even a small donation can have a BIG impact on our efforts:  I believe that the American Dream is still alive in New York City but if we fail to act soon then it will be lost forever.

"My position on different topics ""No on Prop16"" Silicon Valley jobs Safer Neighborhood Immigration Healthcare Infrastructure and Climate Change. Below is a summary for you.  I strongly oppose Prop 16! Vote No on Prop16! Prop 16 proposes UC admissions public jobs and contracts based on the racial mix of California. It will HURT your kids education and jobs.  My opponent Ro Khanna supports Prop-16 a race-based quota system! Can we trust him? He signed a pledge in 2014 not to support Prop16 type laws but has flipped to achieve his political ambitions?  Instead  I support a substantial reform in K-12 education system with more school choices increased use of technology better college prep courses and greater teacher accountability.  I support better vocational training programs to encourage better wage growth for semi-skilled workers. Vote No on Prop16.  Silicon Valley Jobs for the next century: A Bio-Silicon Valley Concept  Propose lower tax rate for start up employees for a period to encourage innovation and reward hard work.  Promote higher wage growth for employees by attaching corporate tax incentives tied to wage levels.  Reinstate SALT tax deductions and promote lesser property taxes for California to encourage housing affordability.  Incentives to set up manufacturing locally and in the US.  Support police reforms for safer neighborhoods  I support reforming police procedures better sensitivity training and greater community interaction with the police. I support secure borders and a strong military. o My opponent Ro Khanna wants to defund Police abolish ICE let criminal illegals stay back in the US and make deep cuts in the military budgets.  Support our Hardworking Law-abiding Immigrant community  Law-abiding immigrants who are skilled and contribute greatly to society wait forever to get the Green Cards. Wrong! o We need better balanced and sane immigration policies. Skilled labor visa priority must change to reduce tens of years of wait time.  Secure our borders and install high tech solutions for visa overstays. o Ro Khanna wants OPEN Borders (Co-sponsor of HR 5383) and supports allowing criminal illegals to remain in our country. Totally Wrong!  Reduce healthcare costs streamline regulations and have healthy competition  Allow the same company drug imports with minimal FDA issues  Price transparency from Medicare Hospitals and Insurance companies to facilitate competition in costs as well as premiums. Encourage upfront cost quotes before procedures are done.  Incentivize smaller clinics for primary care preventive medicine and usage of tax-free HSAs.  Re-examine drug price increases due to intermediaries and regulations.  Reduce the length of college requirements to enter medical school education. Two years of college is sufficient. Increase the supply of medical care personnel  Encourage more insurance plan options outside of the employer-based options.  Reduce hospital and doctors overhead by reforming onerous regulations. Medicare for All promoted by Ro Khanna is COSTLY and Reduces Quality. His argument that it can be paid by the operational savings (estimates of $40-60B per year) fall way short of the required expense of $2-3 Trillion per year. Tax increases for the higher and middle class would become inevitable.  Build Bay area infrastructure and regional cooperation for better traffic flows  To improve our quality of life we need a highly connected and well-coordinated public transit network of Trains BART Buses and Highways for the greater Bay area.  The above must be complemented with high tech innovations to increase the utilization of public transportation resources.  Local cities must be encouraged to create general plans for cities of the next generation i.e. smart cities that will provide work live educate and play environment hubs. These hubs will have shorter commutes and are generally self-sustaining in energy footprint.  Solve Climate Change through High-tech Innovations  Create a Congressional Scientific and Industrial Council (CSIC) focused on promoting Industrial breakthroughs for more efficient and safe energy generation from Solar Nuclear and other climate-friendly sources without impacting the economic well-being of people.  Promote energy conservation generally. Encourage innovative solutions in energy management for all consumption segments.  Pressure all industrialized nations to use better fuels and co-operate in research for cleaner energy solutions.",political,Facebook

Since I was unavailable to take part in the candidate debate on March 11th the following response addresses a few of the questions covered on March 11th's live broadcast.  I believe I am the best choice for Ward 5 Alderman in Clinton as our city has enormous potential in its youth and expansion of first-time voters. Their feedback (and unique perspective) would be of immediate and long-term benefit to Clinton. As a native of Clinton and graduate of our local schools I feel a unique connection to this block of future voters and would encourage their participation through high school senior voter registration.  One problem faced by our city is limited retail shops and restaurants. I will work closely with our Board of Aldermen Chamber of Commerce and other relevant departments to ensure our zoning ordinances and business regulations help retain our current operating businesses while promoting market conditions that attract new businesses jobs and residents to Clinton.  A second challenge faced by Clinton is the congestion faced by drivers on highly traveled roads that lack the capacity to carry heavy traffic. I propose to work closely with our Board of Aldermen city departments and other relevant agencies to revisit high-traffic areas in need of an upgrade and/or expansion. These upgrades include adding turn lanes and expanding two-lane roads to four-lane to allow for more efficient traffic flow.  Between now and our April 6 primary election I have been and will continue to canvas Ward 5 neighborhoods to inquiry firsthand their concerns with the city of Clinton.  I encourage all Ward 5 residents to vote their choice for Alderman on April 6th in the Republican Primary at the Public Works Building at 525 Springridge Road.  If you have any questions or concerns please feel free to reach out to me.,political,Facebook
ENERGY and CLIMATE CHANGEI was recently asked about my view on industrial solar and how we combat climate change/global warming. This is a topic very important to me and I am passionate about. Basically I agree that humans have a negative impact on Earth and we need to reduce our personal carbon footprint on the environment. Negative human impacts include; pollution to waterways/habitat/soils carbon emissions overuse of water and disruption of natural water resources overconsumption of products garbage and lack of adequate recycling facilities etc. Our focus should be on reducing individual energy and natural resource needs at the local level and our homes. I disagree with filling 1000s of acres of high quality farm land with industrial solar period. Agriculture is our #1 economic income and we can not afford to destroy this land for future generations. In some countries farm land is deemed critical infrastructure and I believe the same should be done in Niagara County. Solar energy produced in our backyards will be transferred downstate with very little economic benefit to local municipalities and taxpayers. Billions of dollars of subsidies are being handed out to large corporations some foreign in order to meet unrealistic goals all funded by us taxpayers. I believe we need to return taxpayer money to the taxpayers by incentivizing reducing our energy needs AT THE SOURCE our homes/businesses/vehicles. We should increase tax breaks for home solar/wind systems in order to offset power consumption at the source which will save billions of dollars in upgrades to our already crumbling overworked power grid. Tax breaks and refunds for new windows furnaces roofs insulation etc. Give us back our money so that we can improve our homes and require less energy! We can not talk about increasing green energy production without first talking about reducing our individual energy/natural resource consumption. We need to make our homes more efficient and our vehicles carbon neutral. We all have the same goal To Protect Our Earth but a different path to get to the finish line. I believe my plan is the best path forward will increase jobs in a high paying market reduce our impact on Earth/Climate and enable future generations to continue moving in the right direction.  Thank you for your time and again if you like what you read please share so others can learn of my goals.,political,Facebook

Class time ....  Don't we love a good question!!  Question: An article appeared in the Daily Bulldog this week that said you are basically fiscally irresponsible with a 30+% budget increase from 2012 to current. I am shocked to see this type of increase can you explain?  As always we did some digging (actually locating the budget files - but we did dig  ) .... here's what we found:  Sitting down and pulling up the correct information  see below  a 36% increase is correct on the jail but once you dig into it to see why  it is not due to a lack of fiscal responsibility on the part of your Sheriff.  Sheriff Nichols presented his first jail budget to the County Commissioners and Budget Committee for 2014. The 2014 budget was frozen at 2008 levels when the jail was transitioned into a 72-hour holding facility by the Pike administration (this meant several local residents lost their jobs and inmates were transferred to Somerset County).  This also meant the County was still being taxed at the $1.65 million but the County could only keep $1 million of that and the other $650000 was sent to the Board of Corrections to distribute to other jails (!!) in the state.  Sheriff Nichols was elected in 2012 took office January 2013 and Fiscal Year 2014 was his first budget at the frozen level.  Franklin County Patrol in 2014 = 1550000.00  Franklin County Patrol in 2021 = 1820000.00  Difference: $270000 or 15%  Jail in 2014 = $1650000 (frozen as 72-hour facility)  Jail in 2021 = $2226000.00  Difference: $576000 or 36%*  *Keeping in mind after the jail was opened back up in early 2015:  -We now had to comply with State Department of Corrections Standards in order to obtain a license to re-open as a full time facility  -Manpower was doubled but not brought back to the level prior to 2008. We could not afford to do this so we met the minimum for safety with no excess.  -The building itself required internal renovations to comply with newer Department of Corrections standards.  -Training requirements for new employees to include uniforms equipment updated computers updated software to properly manage inmate information  Why would we open the jail back up and not just continue to send inmates to Somerset?  The reason is: The Board of Corrections ceased to exist and they asked us if we were prepared to re-open our jail or to send inmates to another facility for $100 per day per inmate.  That adds up quickly!  Having inmates in other facilities puts a hardship on them their families their legal counsel etc.  The cost to transport provide medical mental health etc. would still be the responsibility of the Franklin County taxpayer.  So here's the benefit of having a full-time facility:  Besides having inmates housed locally we are also boarding out inmates from other jail facilities due to their overcrowding which generates revenue on a daily basis to help offset the budget gap that we face every year.  We have also been able to bring back jobs to Franklin County.  It is important to know the truth and not simply what the opposition chooses to share (half-truths).  Keep in mind all budgets are not made in a vacuum. They go through an extensive review by the County Commissioners as well as the County Budget Committee - which takes several months. At the end of that negotiation process all agree on a budget.  As always I am available at any time to answer questions - I look forward to hearing from you!  Please share the truth with your friends family and neighbors.  ~Sheriff Nichols 'Of the People For the People'. #PreferredSheriff Register. Vote Nov. 3,political,Facebook
"WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE A CHRISTIAN TODAY?  We live in a very divided environment. Each day we see stories about abortion while at the same time seeing stories about people being tried in the courts for abusing an animal. We see stories about sky rocketing incidents or murder with guns. The guns are generally vilified while the people using the guns are given a pass. We see stories about tax free status for Christians being denied because Christians are generally Republicans. We see stories about all members of the white race being condemned as racists while on the other hand black lives matter. We see stories portraying our nation the United States of America as an outgrowth of slavery rather than as a continuing search for liberty and freedom. Our nation is described as a flawed and terrible place rather than an imperfect ideal searching for greater and greater perfection. Christians are under greater siege now than at any time in the past 100 years.  As these things continue to occur I feel that those who follow Jesus Christ thus who believe that he is the Son of God and the gate on the path to eternal life are being treated as members of a cult where each member believes in an invisible fantasy in a comic book story in a fictional concoction with no real meaning. I also believe there are real reasons Christians are portrayed in this manner.  First many many churches contribute to this fantasy. With their beautiful buildings and symbols with their order and structure with their entertaining music and continuous social activities; with the Sunday School classes and fellowship meetings with the meals and the yard sales with the choruses and bands with the internal networking churches provide a structure that makes both members and guests feel wanted feel cared for feel like they are joining something important. Sometimes this is true. Sometimes it is a facade; a lie.  Christians believers in Jesus Christ are not club members who can be a little bit in or half-way in. Christians are all the way in. They believe in Jesus Christ. They develop their lives around faith in Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ dictates their actions and their thoughts. This is not to say believers are perfect or even nearly perfect. As hard as they try to live as Christ lived they fall short. All members of mankind are sinners; we all fall short. During these trying times it isn't just individual Christians who fall short: it is the Church as an institution that is falling short.  In the United States of America two parts; the establishment clause and the free exercise clause of the First Amendment of the Constitution guarantee that the government will not and can not interfere with the free exercise of religion. However over the past eighteen months churches in mass have kowtowed to the government shuttered their doors locked out their congregations and failed to carry out even the most oft quoted command of our God ""Fear Not."" They have willingly given up their freedom under the Constitution and failed to obey God. This surrender of autonomy this abdication of authority has totally undermined the importance of organized religion in our country. Instead of acting independently to go forward in their collective trust in the sanctity and authority of Jesus Christ they have surrendered to fear. Instead of moving forward with their activities while at the same time presenting alternatives to those who did fear the churches closed their doors and became social media platforms; just another source of information. Organized churches stripped off the armor of God and bared themselves to the assaults of heathens.  At the same time they were giving away their power and authority the churches failed to take firm stands against sins clearly enunciated in the Bible. They failed to take a stand within the constraints of the Word of God. Thousands of churches condone and accept abortion of children. Thousands of additional churches accept the leadership of those bragging about and consistently seeking deviant life styles; lives as homosexuals or lesbians; lives as bisexuals; lives during which they surgically change the characteristics of their biological gender or lifestyles during which they claim to be of a different gender or of no gender. They celebrate their ""pride"" in their deviance. Though the church is entrusted to accept these behaviors; after all they are simply different sins from stealing lying cheating worshipping idols etc.; the church should always accept these behaviors with the grace and tolerance of knowing that those who believe will seek to minimize to eliminate the frequency of their sinning; that they will strive to achieve a more sin free life. Many many churches are failing to accomplish even that. Additional churches are accepting of these behaviors to the point of putting those who practice this behavior into leadership positions. Satan leading the flock. How appropriate in this evil society in which we live.  Of even greater import to those who attend traditional churches should be the lack of outreach the failure to carry out the instructions of Jesus Christ to love our neighbors to treat our neighbors as ourselves to help others. Many churches have little or not outreach few or no ministries designed to help those around them. Tens of thousands of churches do little more than maintain the building in which they meet and pay those tasked with instructing them in the ways of Jesus Christ. If it were not so sad it would be almost humorous that three average guys have met every week face to face in the homes of one another each Sunday fixed a breakfast each week engaged in fellowship conducted a sermon or class every seven days periodically offered Communion developed a website and a local presence and conduct many many ministries within our community. Not only do we build the occasional ramp for the handicapped provide food boxes to elderly Jews support Angel Tree programs for many children assist with the care of the homeless send the children of incarcerated men and women to summer camps but are also active in assisting other ministries to obtain and build busses for use during emergencies support Kairos to visit and minister to those incarcerated participate in the multi-denominational men's group in Northeaster North Carolina but also support Emmaus to provide more intensive support to practicing Christians. To be blunt we are not scared have not been scared and have blatantly disobeyed the governments attempts to control us. Furthermore as a group we have been chastised by other Christians for our beliefs and our actions.  Jesus Christ did not have an easy life. Being a man is not easy. Following Jesus Christ is not easy and it was never intended to be so. If you are going to proclaim yourself to be a Christian it is time to open your hearts attempt to discern what God is telling you to do put on your big-boy pants and start doing your jobs. Though Jesus Christ never coined ""The Great Commission"" he did tell us to make disciples of all nations and to baptize them. Go out and do it. Do not allow others to tell you that you are wrong and can not do it. GO OUT AND DO! Being a Christian is being in action.",political,Facebook
"DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM  I am a democratic socialist lowercase intended. Most who engage this Page are of a fairly conservative persuasion. Consequently the above statement is likely to generate controversy. But that is not the intent of the statement. The intent of the statement is to provide an opportunity to state what it means to be a democratic socialist untarnished by a false portrayal of the term by those with an agenda which runs contrary to the broad mass of the American people.  First let me say to my conservative brothers and sisters I understand many of your positions. I am from a family which are conservative fundamentalists Christian on one side while the other side is best described as liberal establishment. I know both sides to be loving people authentic in their hearts and are well-intended with regards to the future of our Nation. I understand where both sides are coming from.  I consider myself however a part of neither of the above camps although certainly my thoughts are more closely aligned with the liberal establishment. But I reject the liberal establishment as they like the conservative fundamentalists defend an economic system: capitalism which is premised on materialism and competition both of which have led us to devalue human life in favor of soul sapping endless consumption rather than strong national and international communities. Both of the major U.S. political parties support war Wall Street big business and both continue to support a capitalist ideology which creates many of the divisions within our Nation.  For this reason I am a democratic socialist. To many the term socialism is deemed as a threat to one's freedom. But this threat does not exist so let's clear-up this misperception. For most people who are content with their daily lives who work regular jobs who own small businesses democratic socialism is not a threat to your freedom or way of life. I know of no one who wants to take away your small businesses: that would be both inefficient and undemocratic--small businesses are often defined as businesses with 500 or fewer employees.  There comes a point in time however when a business becomes so large that their largeness is no longer a mere reflection of the firm's merit but is a demonstration of an ability by large corporate enterprise to successfully leverage the Nation's assets: assets which they did not build i.e. education transportation networks security apparatuses culture: public assets for which the public should receive an equitable return on investment. Are CEOs on Wall Street at the tech giants the auto firms and elsewhere really worth tens of millions in annual compensation? Perhaps to their specific firm yes; but to the broader national economy? Are not restaurant workers worth more than their measly wage and do not auto and steel plant workers deserve a greater share of the National product? These are the issues which democratic socialist seek to address.  Democratic socialism is a highly nuanced term and there are as many interpretations of the title as there are people who think about it. To date unfortunately the term socialism has misleadingly been defined by those most threatened by the movement: the well-off and the upper management class. They would have us believe that socialism in America would look like that which occurred in the former Soviet Union which was not democratic or in modern day Cuba or Venezuela whose success or non success we will never be able to judge because they were unable to operate free of being undermined by the U.S. other western nations and reactionary forces within their own borders. Any movement towards a socialist system will develop out of the historical forces then present in the given society. In the U.S. this will involve markets and strong civil liberties. The thing that would fundamentally change is a desire to create a system which works for the entire population with a recognition that capitalism's individual survival-of-the-fittest mindset will not get us there.  Socialism seeks greater democracy not less. It seeks to shift power downward towards the middle and poorer classes. To my democratic socialist way of thinking ""the people"" should share control over the J.P. Morgans Citigroups Goldman Sachs . . . Googles and General Motors of the world. This would shift the center of power away from the well-off who due to their wealth exercise a degree of power and control over the Nation which far exceeds the power of their individual votes. This is both undemocratic and unhealthy. The undemocratic concentration of power among the well-off needs to be pushed downward towards the middle and poorer classes and this can only be accomplished if this grouping owns a significant chunk of these large corporations. Equity ownership in these firms with board representation will enable public oversight of these massive firms which daily impact our lives. By default stock ownership with board representation in these large firms will enable greater democratic control over the future of the Nation.  It seems to me that the most efficient way to achieve broader control over these large and powerful economic bodies which have successfully leveraged public assets and average people is through federal ownership stakes in large business enterprises. Perhaps there are better ways to restructure the ownership of these firms but given our current institutional framework federal ownership stakes in large corporations seems to be the quickest path to a more equitable power sharing arrangement. If you have alternative ideas feel free to comment on them. Democratic socialism does not seek to limit your freedoms it seeks to strengthen your freedoms through shifting power from the top tiers of society into the hands of middle and poorer classes through ownership stakes in large powerful private institutions.  Let me state clearly there is no effort here to impugn the character of the rich or wealthy. They like the rest of us are subjects of ideology and circumstances which largely direct our trajectories. I would no more judge a wealthy person than I would judge a crack cocaine dealer on the street. None of us can peer into another's heart. We are talking about systemic issues: foundational ideas which shape the world. As a nation we spend far too much time judging individual members of the opposition rather than in judgement of the broad ideological forces which drive human behavior.  Democratic socialist want strong civil liberties full employment and an assured decent standard of living for all. We do not want to raise tax rates on the middle classes. If this requires redistribution from those who have received a far greater share than what they have individually contributed to the National economy I don't see a problem with this. They after all have been redistributing wealth and income away from the middle and poorer classes for decades. If we are to call ourselves a nation then there must be something we share in common other than national boundaries; we should equitably share power and the National product. We and our ancestors have all contributed to America Inc. this includes the unemployed which have wrongly to date served to keep wage rates down in order to facilitate corporate profits: wage rates which are dictated through monetary policy by the Nation's central bank--the Federal Reserve.  Democratic socialism does not seek to limit your freedoms it seeks to strengthen your freedoms through shifting power from the top tiers of society into the hands of the middle and poorer classes through ownership stakes in large powerful private institutions. It is the democratic thing to do.",political,Facebook
"The multiple crises created by this administration in less than 7 months has the majority of Americans in a state of malaise and discomfort if not outright stress and depression. The uncertainties created by this government are multiple and serious. No one knows their true intentions or goals.The disastrous border crisis the inflation including high food and gas prices which are essentials shortages of consumer goods and even shortages of workers for hire who are needed to help run businesses. The trillions of dollars of expenditures without having the means to pay for them and the constant printing of money with no backup is disastrous. People do not seek or want jobs because the checks or 'stimulus' checks they get by the government exceed their potential job pay and benefits.You see""help wanted""signs everywhere. This malaise is compounded by an inept leadership with no clue of what priorities should come first and with a pandemic that is being terribly mishandled and is out of control. China is taking over the world and America is at war wit itself. America is the biggest enemy of America with incompetent fools in charge.People with Covid are being let inside the country illegally and being bused to unknown locations while every day Americans are getting conflicting messages about masking and mandatory vaccinations and vaccine passports and what not. It is so inefficient and inept and corrupt that they themselves no longer know the solutions nor the truth. It is time for the silent majority to become activists and loudly so with actions and words to preserve the country which is falling apart because of Biden Harris Pelosi Schumer and the democrats in general. The Republicans in The House and The Senate and their conservative followers need to know that these are not the democrats of the past and that they have to start to level the playing field to save America.",political,Facebook

***ECONOMIC COMMUNITY CENTERS -- A REAL IDEA TOWARD OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL***  We hear a lot of talk about the income and opportunity gap and small business support and workforce development. But with current leadership it's as broad as that with no real ideas and no track record for actually building a program that can do it.  I've built a concept to address workforce and small businesses support called Economic Community Centers and are developing it with local municipalities. Click here for the detailed plan:  An Economic Community Center is a hub for existing economic resources in the area from jobs and work programs to entrepreneurial and start-up support. Directing users to job training career upskilling and resources on entrepreneurship small business programs and independent contracting a growing and essential element of today's economy.  The result would be a community of converging economic interests empowering each other with modeling and mentoring a key component.  This is the type of economic policy we need based on diverse first-hand experience in the evolving global economy and a practical way to make it function. This is my background and it will be one my primary focuses from the State House.  I would be working for you the people of District 114 and I take that very seriously.

Hypocritical much?  You know I spent many years avoiding politics on social media because well who really wants to be voluntarily attacked? Thats the problem with todays society opposing views are condemned instead of just understanding their path in life was different and thats what lead to their ideals. I saw a comment the other day that a liberal didnt like talking to her conservative friends anymore...well same because conservatives are labeled has callous and racist somehow? Fun fact a republican president ended slavery...  This the the hypocrisy that I have issues with liberals about:  1. You condemn Trump for his alleged affairs but Clinton admitted to having an affair in the Oval Office.  2. You call Melania weak and a puppet for staying with Trump but you put Hillary on pedestal for her resilience and strong nature for staying with Bill.  3. You spent two years trying to prove Russia interfered with the election and that we need stricter enforcements but want mail in voting. (Because obviously that is the most efficient way to make sure every vote is counted AND that it is not fraudulent).  4. Raising minimum wage does not put America first or create more jobs...increasing minimum wage increases the most expensive part of COGS already so it makes the increase moot AND makes American manufacturers have to produce overseas to be competitive in the market. (In case you dont understand that it closes American factories losing jobs not gaining).  5. You condemn Trump for not doing enough to stop the pandemic but called him racist when he closed the travel borders to slow the spread. Your solution to the problem is passing a bill but you refuse to negotiate a reasonable bill before the election because it will boost the economy and Trumps re-election.  6. You blame Trump for the current stimulus bill that is stalled but Congress is the one with more power and they went on vacation. You also condemned him for forcing the EDD benefits and forcing the states to take some responsibility...and why shouldnt they the states are shutting down the economy not the federal government. -Also any individuals accepting the additional $300 that curses Trumps name when he is the only reason you are getting something additional...your leaders would rather do nothing than at least pass legislation that does have consensus you should ask them why!  7. Biden calling this Trumps Recession when the reality of the recession is from California being shutdown not something Trump did. California is the 5th largest economy in the WORLD all of its own if you dont understand that is the largest thing hindering our economy right now you didnt pay attention in high school.  8. His tax returns...quite frankly I could care less. Every single American does everything they can to pay the least amount of taxes possible so why this is so important to Democratics is beyond me. You know one of the reasons Biden pays so much in taxes? His lack of charitable contributions...and Trump is donating his entire Presidential salary to charity so go figure.  Another fun fact: Trump was nominated twice for the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize for the recent Israeli-UAE-Bahrain peace talks.  My point is not to deter you from your beliefs it is to say that neither side is perfect. Trump is an average American in terms of his speaking but whether you want to admit it or not hes a pretty good businessman. It took a pandemic and world shutdown to stop the economic growth we were experiencing in the US. The only reason we have not recovered as much as we should is the continued shutdown of California and a few other states. COVID is real the sensationalism and fear is not but history has shown that when the economy is good an incumbent President is 100% re-elected. So the hate that dems have for Trump is greater than the health and stability of our nation thats not American.  Disclaimer: I do not agree with everything that Trump says but I in no way wish for his failure because we all fail when that happens no matter who is that office.  May God Bless our Country over the next few weeks as more hate and negativity is spread during these elections.  ,political,Facebook

I work to deliver for you and our district. On education: During the pandemic I supported funding 100% of the per-student formula which is the states contribution to local schools regardless of virtual or in-person instruction. And in the last session I also supported adding $763 million to public education which was the largest K-12 investment in Indiana history. Also 94% of Indiana teachers received an average of $2160 per teacher.  On quality-of-life issues: I supported doubling the penalties for those irritating robocalls you get. So while my opponent has her campaign text you on your cellphone I have always done the hard work since 2015. On jobs. The economy. COVID-19. Education. Healthcare. Energy. Life.

I sent this Letter to the Editor of the SCNow. They published two articles on my Democratic opponent and 13 articles on Congressman Tom Rice since June. Not a single one of those articles were negative. We will see if they publish this one. Just in case they dont here it is.  This is My America too  2020 has been one heck of a year- the deaths of cultural icons COVID-19 hurricanes and forest fires. In fact all of the turmoil and lack of leadership has led me to run for office. Let me warn you though that running for office is not for the faint of heart. Your entire life becomes susceptible to public opinion and public scrutiny. People begin to hate you for no reason. People form opinions about you without meeting you. Yes you get the nasty hate mail in your inbox. None of that is new to anyone who has ever run for office but the one aspect that is the most disturbing for me is the idea that I am somehow unAmerican or dont belong. So let me explain who I am.  My name is Melissa Ward Watson. I was born and raised in DillonSC. I received 2 degrees from colleges in Charleston SC and spent 6 years in the Army Reserves. I made a home there because lets be honest there arent many opportunities for people like me in Dillon. Dillon ranks #2 in poverty with 32.1% of our residents living in poverty. Marlboro ranks #3 with 30% of its residents living in poverty and in Darlington 23% of residents live in poverty. The truth of the matter is people like me know unfortunately that they have to leave home to escape a system that is set against them. It doesnt mean you love home any less. It just means you are yearning for a better life and circumstances for your own children. Make no mistake home is always in the heart. Making a better Pee Dee is one of the many reasons I am now a candidate for Congress.  I have also been accused of not loving my country and being unpatriotic. That too is interesting because I am the only one in this race for Congress who has served in the Army Reserves. My service is the reason I have the support of several Veteran groups and several retired high ranking military officers. Let me caution you about Patriotism. Patriotism isnt just a lapel pin on a coat jacket but patriotism encompasses the love you have in your heart. That love of country first led me to take the Oath to defend my country at 17 years old. That love for my country has also led me to dedicate my life to service. That service began as a youth vacation bible school teacher continued to my time as an Army Reservist teacher and now a candidate for Congress. I love my country even if I dont always love its actions. While others talk about their love of this country I actually work to make it a better place for all Americans.  When I am elected to Congress I hope to create opportunities in the 7th Congressional District that will prevent talent from leaving. People from the Pee Dee shouldnt have to move to Charlotte or Charleston in search of better economic opportunities and people from Marlboro and Dillon shouldnt have to drive to Florence for better jobs. We need leaders who will provide better economic opportunities right here. I plan to be that leader because this is my America too and she is definitely worth fighting for.  Melissa W. Watson Democratic Candidate for Congress in the 7th Congressional District,political,Facebook
BREAKING NEWS: PROTECTING JOBS AT SAPPI I want to thank DEP Commissioner Melanie Loyzim for responding back to me promptly after I filed my comments on the Sappi situation with the following message that provides significant reassurance to many of us concerned about any possible loss of jobs at Sappi. It will require our staying on top of this issue but I am confident the Commissioner understands the gravity of our concerns: Sen. Baldacci Last Thursday Brookfield withdrew their application for a water quality certification for the Shawmut Dam eliminating the need for DEP to issue a final decision on that application. Brookfield will be submitting a new application to further address the fish passage issues raised by the Department of Marine Resources and DEP will have one year from receipt of the new application to issue a decision. Many assumptions were made by certain parties to conclude that denial of the certification would result in removal of the dam and that removal would result in closure of the mill. DEP will be evaluating what effect various changes to accommodate fish passage at the dam would actually have on the mills intake and discharge and will work with Sappi to address any concerns with Brookfields new application. Closure of the mill would be an unacceptable outcome. Sincerely Melanie Loyzim Commissioner,political,Facebook
We are down to the final hours before election day on Tuesday May 18th. When I decided to join this election for school board I had the goal to work hard for the students teachers and taxpayers of the district. My message has been clear. I am a life long resident with children in the school system and want to make Hempfield the best district not only in Westmoreland County but in Pennsylvania. I believe the foundation is in place and we as a district should be striving to be the best. I have a deep passion for this and I believe my life / work experiences have placed me in a position to be an asset to Hempfield. I will be transparent and have been. I have answered every post direct message text phone call and I will always continue to do so. I enjoy posting about the different events in Hempfield that I am involved so everyone can see what are great students are doing that I may be a small part of.  The current board has worked extremely hard to right the ship of past practices and I support them in their efforts. We need to be sure that the correct people are being elected to the board so we continue the path that has helped taxpayers and students. They have held the line on tax increases something I fully intend to do within the means we have. I am against the spot tax assessments. While I do believe everyone should be paying their equal share this practice is harmful to the district and its residents and could deter incoming population from buying residences and property in our district while just not being fair to lifelong current residents.  I commend the current board on their guidance through Covid-19. I understand that we may not have agreed on all the decisions that were made but I feel these were the best decisions for our students within their legal right. We now need strong leadership to continue as we come out of the crisis and back to normalcy. We do not need to look backward but strive to the future.  I have spoken to hundreds of you at your doors and countless have messaged me the hot button issues are clear. As I have stated throughout I am against any school curriculum that may divide us as a nation further. Our kids need to educated to the fullest but we must make sure that this information doesn't have a political agenda and gives our smart students an opportunity to make their own opinions. I am also against male students playing in female athletics. As a father of a high level female student athlete I can understand the detrimental effects this could have on athletics as a whole.  I intend to work with Hempfield Township and local leaders as we need to be a united front. Township leaders depend on the school to be and attraction to the area and the school depends on the township to provide resources for family sustaining jobs that will keep our population at home and attract population from the outside when moving into the area.  I support all extracurricular activities associated within the school and outside the school. Hempfield has resources that can support these functions and we need to be sure that the township and school leaders are working together to provide these resources to all of the activities and all spaces are being utilized.  There are big decision's coming in the next years. A decision will have to be made about the High School if we remodel or build new. Our high school students and teachers deserve better infrastructure than what we currently have. Hempfield will have to spend money on this decision. This should be done without an effect on the taxpayer and if there has to be an effect on the taxpayer it should be the very last option and at minimal expense.  I will bring energy passion and transparency to this position if elected. If you do the research you will see that I have been open and transparent throughout this race and will always continue to do so. I humbly ask for your vote on Tuesday May 18th to continue the excellent track Hempfield in on.  Thank You  Jerry,political,Facebook

Do you remember this summer when the Assembly ignored the five days of public testimony in opposition to their plan to use CARES act money to buy homeless hotels and did it anyway? I do.  Do you remember this summer when the Assembly was told by the Inspector General what they were doing with the CARES act money was illegal but the Muni said they would wait till after the election so they could get a different answer and are now getting audited because of it? I do.  Do you remember when the Assembly used the CARES act money to pay for grants to badminton clubs and groups promoting interstellar space travel? I do.  Do you remember when the city used even more CARES act money to pay $127000 for six 86 flat screen displays while people were losing their jobs and couldnt buy groceries because the $200 gift card program the Assembly was offering had ran out? I do.  Do you remember the private emails revealed that Forrest Dunbar and Chris Constant engaged in a behind the scenes shaming campaign in order to get church leaders to give favorable testimony towards using CARES act funds for building purchases? I do.  Do you remember when Chris Constant harassed a rabbi who was giving testimony in opposition to the homeless hotel purchase and it made national news? I do.  Do you remember when the Assembly closed the chambers to the public except for the people giving testimony that favored their diversion of the CARES act money? I do.  Do you remember when the Felix Rivera couldnt be bothered to comply with the same COVID rules that were being used to shut down hundreds of businesses in town and is now facing a recall because of it? I do.  Do you remember when the Assembly hired code enforcers to police local businesses for mandate violations but couldnt be bothered to police the people openly using drugs and exposing themselves to children at the ice rinks? I do.  Do you remember when private emails revealed Chris Constant and Forrest Dunbar tried to dox a DOD employee that was giving testimony in opposition to the diversion of the CARES act money? I do.  Do you remember when the Assembly doled out CARES act money for bike trails while longtime local restaurants that employed dozens of people closed forever? I do.  Do you remember when Felix Rivera accused the people that were trying to protect their neighborhoods from the Munis plan to bypass the zoning board as being racists? I do.  Do you remember when members of the public were told they werent allowed to point at or address assembly members by name during testimony? I do.  Do you remember when the Assembly would not let members of the public read another persons testimony and then walked out of the meeting when those people asked why? I do.  Do you remember when Felix Rivera let two transgender protestors roll around on the floor of the chambers for hours but then kicked out people for raising their voice during public testimony? I do.  Do you remember when 5000 midtown residents gathered signatures for a recall and then had to defend the recall in court because the entire Democratic leadership of midtown helped sue to block it? I do.  Do you remember when the Assembly refused to proceed with a special election to replace the mayor because it would be too expensive and left district 3 voters without representation for almost 9 months? I do.  Do you remember when the wealthy downtown property developers got a 12 year exemption from paying property tax but your property taxes went up? I do.  Do you remember when the Muni shut down the homeless services at the transit center so a 60 million dollar hotel could be built there but then claimed there wasn't enough property for shelters available near bus routes as justification to change the zoning laws? I do.  Do you remember when the AFL-CIO Alaska Center and activist groups spent almost $60000 of Union and Outside money to run ads for Felix Rivera to avoid being recalled? I do.  Everyone of the points above is an example of why we are where we are because citizens are not getting involved and instead spend their time screaming at the sky - which is ok if that's what you want otherwise nothing will change unless you do.

 Vote for the one that represents YOU   When reading about the obscene amounts of money being spent on the campaigns of Marlenes opponents it would be easy to become cynical. In a recent Scranton Times article it was revealed that Marty Flynn (D) and Chris Chermak (R) have spent or have had spent on them by political action committees nearly $300000 just on television commercials. You have to almost read the absurdity of that figure twice to comprehend just how much cash is being spent to elevate two men to jobs that pay around $90000 annually. Then you realize that figure is just the tip of the iceberg. It does not even account for how much each campaign is spending on what seems like near-daily mail on your doorstep plus all the other paid-for materials in this campaign.  It will not surprise people either to see what the article shows as the source of all this moneysome of the largest polluters in our area well-known partisan political influencers and plenty of special interest groups.  It is not hard for that initial cynicism to magnify when you realize the obvious fact that these wealthy donors and special interest groups are not investing all this money on Marlenes opponents without expecting a return on that investment a return that will unequivocally promote their interests even when it is at the expense of yours.  In this special election though you do not have to let cynicism win because you have something even more powerful than all that money being spent on the typical politicians in this raceYOU HAVE THE POWER TO VOTE FOR SOMETHING BETTER.  There is reason to be hopeful this time because people see that there is a legitimate alternative to politics as usual. For example when the Scranton Times editorial board endorsed Marlene it was not because they expected anything in return; it was because they identified a smart hard-working alternative to the same old same old. They saw her as the one person in the race able to identify the most important matters affecting the district and they saw her as someone willing to speak out on those matters and present solutions which is what the people of this area need.  Marlene will not have the amount of money on her campaign reports that her opponents have. None of the areas most egregious polluters will be there. High profile and polarizing political influencers will not be there. And while that can be seen as a negative in some ways it reveals one very important thing and that is the fact that she will not be beholden to any of those forces. Instead Marlene will be free to vote her conscious on important matters that affect her constituents. She will be able to put RESIDENTS FIRST always and not be influenced by the large checks donors gave her to get ahead of you in line. She will be able to vote for COMMON SENSE SOLUTIONS to problems and not be swayed by special interest groups who will feel she owes them a debt in decision making. And she will be able to create OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL not just for all who could afford it when she was running for office.  All that money being wasted on mud-throwing for her opponents can really bring us down but lets not let it.  On May 18 vote for something better. Vote for Marlene Sebastianelli.,political,Facebook

"More failed Leadership from Gov. Evers Mayor Tom Barrett and the Democratic Party.. No real great paying jobs in Milwaukee will lead to more pain for the City.. No REAL plan to save Milwaukee.. NO MAIL Truck JOBS For MILWAUKEE...  From The Northwestern News:  OSHKOSH  Oshkosh Corp. announced Tuesday it would build its ""next generation"" delivery vehicles for the U.S. Postal Service in South Carolina. Oshkosh Defense a division of Oshkosh Corp. will open a facility dedicated to next generation delivery vehicles in Spartanburg South Carolina. The company will hire over 1000 employees there and expects that on-site supply chain partners will also hire additional people. Oshkosh Corp. will establish the Next Generation Delivery Vehicle Technical Center in Oshkosh John Bryant  president of Oshkosh Defense and executive vice president at Oshkosh Corp. said in an emailed statement. The center will be staffed by more than 100 employees who will provide engineering and program support for USPS vehicle manufacturing. The company won the multibillion-dollar contract to make up to 165000 ""next generation"" delivery vehicles for the postal service in February. The contract would replace the Postal Service's aging vehicle fleet. ""We worked with the Milwaukee 7 New North and the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation to explore opportunities to manufacture these vehicles in Wisconsin"" Bryant said in an emailed statement. ""Unfortunately we could not identify an existing building that was viable for this project."" Oshkosh Defense announced it will repurpose a warehouse in South Carolina with features to accommodate large-scale manufacturing. Production will begin in summer 2023. Since the Postal Service announced the contract in February the company has experienced a maelstrom of opposition to the contract award which the longtime federal contractor has characterized as typical to federal contract awards in statements and its latest earnings call. Ohio lawmakers previously introduced a resolution to halt the contract in March. And Ohio-based Workhorse Group which had been a finalist for the Postal Service contract filed a bid protest in federal court. Oshkosh Corp. became an intervenor in the case because the outcome of the case could economically affect it.",political,Facebook

"To the City & County we Love  We can't tell you how grateful we are for all the support you've expressed during this insanity that is COVID. Unfortunately we have made the decision to close due to pressure from the Colorado Liquor Enforcement Division. Under an ""emergency order"" and at Governor Jared PolisPolis' direction the liquor enforcement division was granted the ability to suspend or revoke liquor licenses for any holders that ""did not comply with his orders."" A sting operation was set in motion yesterday that has affected more than 60 restaurants in both ours and neighboring counties with the message being ""Fall in line or risk losing your ability to operate indefinitely."" We are all still in shock at this underhanded method being used to control those that cannot survive without staying open. More so after publicly stated he was leaving enforcement to the counties.  Now we know there are some out there who will be tempted to celebrate this as a win and I want to take a moment to remind those individuals that our entire staff is in jeopardy of losing their livelihoods homes and jobs at a time when the industry is dying and jobs are dwindling. This is not the time to celebrate. We and so many others are facing permanent closure unless something changes and soon. Please reach out to our state leadership and make your voice heard. Together we can find a way forward in the midst of this devastating pandemic. For those of you who would like to help out please start with reaching out to Gov. Polis by phone at (303) 866-2855 or by email at governorpolis@state.co.us.  The governor is ignoring the will of the people of Weld county and using an underhanded technicality to overturn our leadership's policies and he is using these methods to destroy Colorado's small business community. We believe it is time to take a stand and are working with affected restaurants around the county to try and do just that. Please stand with us.  We have not determined if we will be able to open for take out and/or delivery yet but we will have an update for you after the holiday. Please be patient as we determine the best way to survive.

Another election cycle with more promises of jobs and marketing as solutions to pervasive issues in Vigo County. This is empty campaign rhetoric that makes for great 30-second ad campaigns when paired with pictures of parks and warehouses. Its especially empty coming from someone who switched party affiliation to indulge in a local base and seem more electable contradicting the entire basis of a recent mayoral campaign as an independent candidate. Thats my opponent and thats typical Vigo County politics. Its not me.  Here are the important facts. Vigo County ranks terribly in the state of Indiana in the following areas:  - Very low household income - High poverty rates - High bankruptcy rates - Adults in poor health - Physically inactive adults - Access to healthy food - High property crime - High rates of substance abuse - 35% of all arrests related to substance use - No population growth  We need to acknowledge the fact that we face the same issues year after year  even generation after generation. Its time to elect people who understand that we face serious problems which require collaborative solutions. We ALL deserve to have our basic physical and emotional needs met including help with health substance use professional development and training. These needs should call us to lose our apathy and engage in real solutions that support individual family and community wellness.  This is why Im asking you to choose me Chris Switzer as your next Vigo County #Commissioner.,political,Facebook

These activists are now pushing for no law-enforcement involvement in these investigations of our Police Department and are now wanting their own building apart from City Hall that will still need to be renovated. This is going to cost us millions over the years.

"""The School Boards purpose is strictly we hire a superintendent..."" ""The purpose of the School Board is to find the best superintendent that we can."" ""The job of the school board is to hire the best superintendent we can find...""  These are quotes from current school board members running in the election pulled directly from the Warrick County Standard and the Courier and Press.  These statements have been bothering me for some time and I have a few thoughts to share with everyone.  While hiring the best Superintendent is one of the jobs of the School Board it is far from the School Board's purpose.  I once heard a candidate and current school board member use the analogy that a School Board is like a Board of Directors and a Superintendent is like a CEO. This isn't a bad analogy but the candidate went on to say that a Board of Directors picks the CEO and that is their purpose. That's where the analogy lost me because a Board of Directors sole job is not to hire a CEO. It's purpose ultimately is to ensure that it's stakeholders best interests are met. The same can be said for our School Board it's sole purpose is to make sure it's shareholders best interests are being met and a School Boards shareholders are it's students teachers and community.  They do this by passing policies adopting and overseeing annual budgets and yes by hiring and evaluating a superintendent.

This from Cadillac business leader Mike Hamner (as it appeared in the Cadillac News Speak Out Column):  Cadillac Area Progress  I would like to ask the voters of Cadillac to look at the progress made over the past few years and consider this if you plan on voting for mayor and city council. Ask yourself Are we as a community going in the right direction? Please consider: These past few years prior to the pandemic and during it Cadillac leadership has made great progress in making Cadillac a better place to live work and play. So much change in just a few short years  downtown apartment building new city wellfield supplying clean safe water blighted industrial building removed and replaced with a solar garden a downtown farmers market and gathering venue out of a blighted building restaurants and distillery movie theater preserved LED streetlights and Cadillac West improvement board are among some of the more noteworthy positive changes. Industry is thriving with more jobs available than in recent memory while other industries are looking to Cadillac for their expansion. These tangible improvements along with balanced budgets low crime and city services continuing to improve all contribute to Cadillac moving in the right direction. We all have our part to play in making Cadillac a better place for our families and we should all recognize that this is a journey and not a destination so the work and progress never ends. There are things Cadillac still needs to work on to improve there always will be  but keeping us going in the right direction takes leadership and dedication. So are we going in the right direction? Consider what the leadership of the City of Cadillac has been able to accomplish. Do your part and vote. If you think its better now and we are going in the right direction please cast your vote for Mayor Carla Filkins.  Michael J. Hamner Cadillac,political,Facebook
"Relevant Answers to Boston Globe Questions- that never seem to make it into the hit piece editorials  (Supporting Documents Can be found on our website: https://savenonantum.com/in-the-press.html)  When you write that ""Several Newton City Councilors have ...lied about us"" which councils are you referring to and what specifically were the lies?  We recently announced our community endorsements (we are Ward1). Since then Councilors Leary and Greenberg who are from Ward 1 and who did not get our endorsement came out with a statement calling us liars about issues our community is facing. In addition the City Council leadership team of President Susan Albright and Vice President Rick Lipof have also made similar public statements in an attempt to discredit us. (we have provided you some examples for reference there are more if you need them)  Nonantum has always been the gateway to Newton. We are the Number One Village in Newton for diversity and affordability. We are a welcoming place for immigrants and others wishing to make a start in Newton. The data our demographics and socio-economic statistics prove this. Our goal is to keep it this way. The city charter is currently written so that citywide concentrated elite political groups control who is elected in local neighborhoods. Oftentimes those selected officials dont have the best interests of the people of their neighborhood at heart. This insulated group effectively disenfranchises all voters in Newton. They have proven time and again they represent special interests and dont have the best interest of our neighborhood or many other neighborhoods at heart.  The people who are against Save Nonantum are anxious that our bringing the community together in an organized fashion resulted in the March Special Election having record breaking voter turnout in our community. They know that if we do this again it will disrupt their power and cause issues for them throughout the city in the upcoming election. Thats why we started Save Nonantum to enable our community's voice to be heard. Councilors Albright and Lipof know that our residents are not happy with the direction they are pushing the city towards. They know we want a change of council leadership and policy direction. So basically they resort to slandering us in the hope of changing voters' opinions of us. They say we are liars; that none of the issues we talk about really affect our community or worse are not even really happening. They say no one from city leadership is attempting to chip away at our community. Leaders from community organizations from throughout our village have repeatedly told the city of our issues and concerns but the current leadership keep denying the issues exist. It has become more evident every day to the people of Nonantum they needed a strong voice in local politics.  Councilor Greenberg told me she asked to meet with you and you declined. Is that correct?  That is incorrect frankly it's dishonest. We invited all the candidates for the Ward 1 City Council positions to meet with us. She was the only one who declined. I have attached the email exchange to verify our attempt to meet with her. Lack of responsiveness and political misinformation is one of the reasons that Councilor Greenberg has a strong challenger in this race.  Why would you say that you are being ignored by officials if you don't accept opportunities to talk to them?  The premise of the question is false. We have taken every opportunity to meet and communicate our concerns with our elected and appointed officials. Our community is being ignored. We look for every opportunity to communicate with our city officials. Besides Councilor Greenbergs clearly false assertion to the contrary can you give us a time you know about that we didnt talk with a councilor?  We've been ignored when we ask politicians to address our real and urgent concerns. They have always turned instead to distractions and not those real hard city issues that the local politicians should be focused on. For example as mentioned the fire hydrants that don't work resulted in one of our local families' homes being burned to the ground. Parking on both sides of Nonantums narrow streets have repeatedly caused dangerous problems for emergency vehicles to get to emergencies. We have rats flooding our neighborhood & entering people's homes. On Jewett Street for example due to the rapid massive developments happening around us.  This nonsense of we declined to talk is baseless political posturing. Sometimes these politicians say they are willing to meet with us but simply dont in fact ever make it happen. I would have hoped that when council leadership hears something about the community or our group that they would first reach out to understand what's happening before going to social media to denounce our concerns. They have pledged to do their jobs as city councilors to make sure our city infrastructure works that our homes are protected that our children get the education they deserve but they are failing us. Additionally they should listen and respect people's differences instead of attacking people who don't agree with them.",political,Facebook
"Nick Girka is a former resident he served as Clerk and Trustee and I realized a couple years ago that he was one of only a few trustees who was open minded and willing to listen. He was inspiring and part of the reason I have decided to run for Village Trustee.  ""I wanted to take a minute out of my day to reach back out to the community of Campton Hills. I spent nearly 8 years living in the village. During that time I had the privilege to serve as both Clerk and Trustee. Many times I was faced with difficult decisions.  One decision was to support our local businesses with an unpopular topic. During that time I had the privilege of getting to know Kim Weiss. She amazed me with her passion. Some might say she was only looking out for her best interest. I can attest that it was far more than that. Kim does have passion for her business but even more so about her community. She wanted to maintain the means to provide jobs and sponsor local orginazations. She longed to be a pillar in her community and an example of what hard work and determination can lead to.  Kim most impressed me with her intelligence and depth of understanding about what matters and how to pursue her passions with a relentless drive. Kim never gives up. Kim routinely puts her own self interest behind the needs of her employees and needs of her neighbors. OTP has always supported events and organizations because it was the right thing to do.  Kim deserves the opportunity to be your representative. She embodies the term servant. I can only imagine the passion insight tenacity and open minded leadership she will bring to the table. Kim has been there since the beginning survived economic downturms business obstacles and now a pandemic which has left many businesses closed permanently. I cannot imagine a better person to select as your representative. I cannot imagine a person more willing to listen. I cannot imagine a person more qualified to trust.  This is an easy endorsement for me. Kim it has been a distinct honor getting to know you and an example of how to conduct my own life.

This is what I've learned today picking up and dropping off registered voters. 1. The wall behind Pleasant Street the one in front of the Old FHS is crumbling. The resident called City Hall several times because children play back there and it's got the P.R Flag all crumbling down. Meanwhile...the there are alleged sightings of council member(s) eating $200 dinner plates WITH THE CITY'S MONEY at Dario's... 2. More complaints about the DPW and the workers...

Indiana State Rep John Jacob's Call to Ban Mandatory Covid Vaccines and Vaccine Passports or Any Kind of Vaccination Proof  STOP THE TYRANNY FROM DC AND WITHIN INDIANA!!  We must stop the Covid vaccine mandate and vaccine passport or any kind of vaccination proof . We must do this at the local level. We as a state can put a stop to this and reject the mandates that the Biden administration have launched against us.  This is CRIMINAL!! This is High Treason from the highest office in the land.  If we cave into this tyranny and control we must ask ourselves what are we leaving the next generation? To our children grandchildren and all the future generations to come? The answer is slavery we are leaving our children in the throes of tyrannical slavery!  We MUST STOP this craziness in its tracks immediately! This is a dictatorial authoritarian power play!  The Biden administration and the government are weaponizing businesses against us we the people. This is a well-planned strategic war plan against the American people.  Call to Action  Call the Speaker of the House Speaker Huston and Senate Pro Tem Senator Bray. Politely demand they take action when they reconvene for the redistricting session in a couple weeks. The legislature does not need the approval of the Governor they can and must draft present and vote legislation into law to ban mandatory Covid vaccines and vaccine passports or any kind of vaccination proof. If Governor Holcomb vetoes it then the house and the senate can overturn it.  They absolutely do not have to wait until the 2022 session. The Speaker of the House and Senate Pro Tem have the authority to decide if this will be addressed and if they will take action to protect fellow Hoosiers. If Speaker Huston and Senate Pro Tem Bray and the other GOP legislators do nothing now by then 2022 it will be too late and people will have lost their jobs and their livlihoods. If they do nothing now it is utterly shameful and they are proving they care nothing about you the people of the great state of Indiana. If they do nothing now to protect you us... they in fact are showing they hate us and we mean nothing.  THIS IS COERCION!  This is outrageous unacceptable and must be stopped NOW! I urge all Hoosiers to to be brave and take a stand and put a stop/pause to their criminal actions. You wont just be protecting yourself but your family and friends. Youll also protect others across the state of Indiana and America in the midst of everything by blazing forward for liberty and freedom.  America is at a crisis crossroads and if we continue down this downward spiral into destruction we may not be able to return to any form of sanity.

So as we Small Business owners expected but the know-it-alls seem surprised about the new jobs report showed a small amount of job creation.  We all know of landlords (like Myself) that haven't received rent in a year and a half from protected tenants and we all know business owners who can't find workers to hire even though we are willing to pay them and give them security more than likely because of the generous additional unemployment benefits.  As business owners we have seen a great reversal in prosperity in our businesses and seem to be taking the brunt of the costs of the Covid and the recession placed on us by this Administration's policies.  Like all the great storms we need to hunker down and hope that better days are coming soon. Good luck to all of you remember you are not alone.,political,Facebook
So I have been looking over the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package it is 591 pages long partway through I was getting so mad I could not even continue any more. Here is some of what I came across.  $1 Billion for Socially Disadvantaged Farmers Program (nothing to do with COVID) $800 Million for food for peace (USAID Foreign food assistance) $135 Million Endowment of the Arts $135 Million Endowment of the Humanities $36 Million for Gallaudet University and the Technical Institute for the Deaf(Gallaudet is a private university for the deaf with a graduation rate of 44%) $35 Million for Howard University $100 Million for the Institute of Education Sciences $200 Million Institute of Museum and Library Services $20 Million to upgrade systems for the Affordable Care Act $1 Billion for the Corporation for National Service and the National Service Trust (Americorps) $50 Million family planning $2 Billion for Amtrak $3 Billion for Aviation Manufacturing Jobs Protection - So what this appears to be is for aircraft manufactors providing they either laid off 10% of their work force in 2020 or lost 15% of income the federal government will pick up the tab for 50% of the compensation for manufacturing employees who make under $200K. This is when I had to stop reading.  This list does not even include the $15 an hour Min Wage that was thrown in.  This folks is how you get to $1.9 Trillion we do not have in 591 pages.  I know some of you are counting on that $1400 stimulus check that is what they are counting on. They figure that is the cost of the bribe to get you to overlook all of this and more.

As a mother with a beautiful daughter I find it reprehensible that my opponent would take his political platform and attempt to accuse me of not caring about our children. So I have a few points I wish to clarify so you the people can understand how youre being misled to belief falsehoods.  My opponent has made the accusation that myself and the other Scioto County Commissioners have been doing nothing about the terrible situation regarding Children Services. I would like to take a moment to clarify his points and ensure you are not being misled by someone who isnt giving you the full story.  First we have been working diligently to help bring change to our Children Services Organization. We have worked with the Scioto County Children Protective Services Board and provided insight to help steer internal policies. We have also helped facilitate a working professional relationship between the Ohio Jobs and Family Services and the Scioto County Children Services Board. This has never taken place before and we believe its an historic move that will help protect our children. To make claims that we are doing nothing while he has attended no Commissioner meetings and asked no questions is not only irresponsible but shows a lack of initiative and should make everyone question whether he really wants change or just a position and title.  Second my opponent is choosing to accuse the Scioto County Commissioners of being negligent which according to him has led to the murder of children. I condemn this in the harshest terms as it does nothing but use a tragic situation and involves the already suffering family for the sake of a political talking point. I would invite my opponent to actually attend a public meeting or to speak to the CPS Director directly before accusing the Scioto County Commissioners indirectly of murdering children.  If my opponent would ask questions attend meetings or get involved in ways that do not consist entirely of attacking people on the internet he might learn that the Commissioners have been directly involved to the highest extent possible in protecting children and ensuring that Children Services is fully funded. Its also important to note that to date Children Services has not requested funding and currently has a healthy fiscal balance.  I encourage my opponent to get engaged with the community and find ways to become informed of how our processes work before using the death of children as a cheap political talking point against those of us who are doing the very best we can to ensure the children of our county are safe.,political,Facebook
The Biden administration and Democrats in Congress are making it difficult for our economy to really get back on its feet. Instead of rewarding people to stay home and not get a job they should pay for childcare costs for people who go to work. There are millions of jobs in this country going unfilled. Some stated reasons are fear of contracting COVID but vaccines are readily available now. If you are an antivaxer but are afraid of working a job because you fear getting the disease then the government and tax payers should not be expected to support you.,political,Facebook
"From two days ago WHAT IS GOING ON HERE REALLY A few days back I had posted an older post that I had written back ten years ago. I have gone back to at least twice over the years not talk about the movie ""Inception"" itself but how its theme is being played out in real life today. The idea of planting a thought in someone's head is probably a few thousand years old. People were told that they belong in a certain class or a certain status and that was all their lot in life. And so it went. Today it still operates among races and nations among classes of people  among parties and even religions. And we easily accept. Aldous Huxley once stated that the TV will be used to control the masses and opinions it has become a fact of life today. So much so that we don't even realize. Long before 2015 I had talked about the mass media about ""Not so free press"". That one that media was being used to manipulate opinions but also one could choose to select the ""truth"" they wanted to hear even if it was a bold face lie it didn't matter as long as one was willing to accept it as the truth. No one needs to force feed you garbage if you are willing to eat it anyway. We today live in a society where people on both sides that lack true education and can not read above a fifth grade level feign to be the experts on the #Constitution and the law. Where the politicians and others can stand in front of people and tell blatant lies while a video of a true incident plays in the back ground people will still believe the liar and the lies as the facts. And why not we lie to ourselves about our own lives our own affairs our own kids our own addictions all day long don't we? No need for double speak or any other nuances. ""We hold these truths to be self evident"" has become ""truth is whatever it is that we want it be"".  Who are the losers though if we do not follow the truth if we do not seek it if we outright deny it? Whatever happened to the ""truth shall set you free""?  There is a caveat a child can be taught to believe anything as the child grows however and hopefully gets some directions and learns new things the child ""may"" grow up and learn to discern between the truth and a falsehood. I am not talking about advanced education or degrees I am talking about some knowledge that gives one a chance to use reasoning and logic. Apparently these are rare commodities. Thanks to the TV the internet and the video games we have learned to live in fantasies. Our lives have followed. In interpersonal relationships in our jobs in our families we have learned to live in make believe. Don't we think that gender can be fluid a family is whatever you can get life is not a pattern or a plan  it is a smorgasbord you pick and choose whatever you like and it will all workout. In a vast majority of cases it does not we know but be we accept. Whatever it is. We honor it as the real thing. We have given up so much of ourselves that we are dumpster diving in the trash in of what used to be life and we relish it. We call it freedom. No.wonder we allow ourselves to be misled misdirected and fooled willingly and we enjoy it we worship those that con us and fool us and use us and we call it "" having power"". Long before a few of the psychologists and the sociologist had paid attention I was panning these new freedoms and new ways of living but no one wanted to hear it we have become zombies and we celebrate our enslavement we will pay dearly and so will our children and grandchildren.

"My answers to Spinal Column questionnaire for special upcoming edition: What are you doing in the final days leading up to the election to reach out to voters? My overall campaign strategy changed in August when the race changed with the addition of a Democrat and the incumbent Republican losing. It was going to be a challenge already going 1 vs 1 against the incumbent . I'll continue to do social media and get my signs out.  Will you be holding any kind of socially-distanced event to speak to residents or a Zoom call to do the same? I have nothing planned but I am willing to attend any candidate debate or town hall.  What platform are you running on and is it resonating with voters? The platform that I am running on is to make Commerce Township an ""Everything is Essential Zone."" I do not believe the Lansing or DC government should be deciding what is essential in Commerce Township. We do not need a nanny state. The EEZ plan would help residents and businesses with their fiscal stability. And if the residents and businesses are in good shape the township will be in good shape too. I have not heard any complaints about the plan. Though I expect some push back from possibly the board and Lansing. As it goes against the Governor's EOs and would 'Rock the Boat"". But being a sheep is not how I am.  In these last few months of the national news media reporting on protests riots looting and police defunding what do you want Commerce residents to understand about your stance on public safety and how you will ensure that Commerce remains a safe community should you win the supervisor position? My stance on public safety is that it is an important function of government at all levels. I support the current staffing levels. I am willing to increase it as needed. When I am elected I will sit down with the commander of our contracted deputies to discuss how they are deployed and what they are prioritizing their time on. There are some who feel speed enforcement on M-5 is a good use of their time. I politely disagree. I feel they should be spending more time in our neighborhoods. Hopefully with more community interaction and encouraging ""See something Say something ""  we can find secret drug labs and houses before they blow up. Also revisiting legal marijuana dispensaries is most definitely not on my agenda as supervisor if elected.  As COVID-19 remains a part of life what can and should the township do to provide resources to help folks who are impacted by job loss as a result of the pandemic? The EEZ plan could be a good first step in helping residents. I will support continuing the efforts of our Park and rec dept. through the senior center to help our seniors with food and activities. I would make sure to inform the residents of any higher government programs available to affected residents and businesses. I would also explore the possible option of creative tax payment plans for residents and businesses  who have been hardest hit by the lockdown. The township has worked with at least one business before to achieve a win-win result.  The economy is also an important issue for voters. How is Commerce Township's economy faring and what are your plans to make it stronger? Do you have plans to entice more businesses and restaurants into the township and ultimately more jobs into the community? My plan to make the Commerce Township economy stronger and entice more businesses/restaurants is to make Commerce Township more inviting. My ""Everything is Essential Zone plan would be a good start. Keeping our taxes low is important also. The board of trustees planning commission and DDA need to take a long look at exactly what businesses/restaurants  we are willing to accept in Commerce Township. If we are too picky or fussy we could lose out on a business/restaurant that could be successful. We have some niches foodwise that are not addressed by competing commercial areas such as family style steakhouse. More Applebee ish less Bar Verona ish. If you want a fancy restaurant there are a lot in the general area.",political,Facebook

Platform  The three priorities of my campaign are as follows:  Education. Our public education system has been devastated by the influence of DeVos money. During the Snyder administration when all the branches of government were controlled by Republicans they declared that all of our schools are public schools including the charter schools and online charter schools. The amount of our property tax dollars per pupil is the same across the nonprofit public schools and the for profit public schools. I will fight to hold the for profit charter schools whether online or brick and mortar schools to the same standards as our public schools. The pandemic has demonstrated the failure of virtual schools in educating our children and they get the same amount per pupil as our brick and mortar schools when there are obvious differences in the costs to maintain. Healthcare. Healthcare is among our largest employers in the 97th District. Healthcare for all not only saves lives but also creates jobs. Same as last cycle I will fight to maintain the medicaid expansion to save our local hospitals that have been devastated financially by the pandemic. Colorado has recently passed a law that puts a cap on the cost of insulin per month at 100 dollars. I will fight to pass similar legislation in Michigan. Criminal Justice Reform. I will fight to end mandatory minimum sentences and close the school to prison pipeline. All convictions regarding marijuana use need to be expunged. Addiction is not a crime; it is an illness and yet our prisons are filled with those whose primary crime is substance abuse. When our mental health facilities closed many of those people ended up in our prisons. It costs 37262 dollars for a year of tuition and room and board at UofM. It costs 36000 for a year in prison. Fees and fines place an undue burden on the poor. It costs as much to put them in jail for failure to pay as the fine is worth. Poverty should no longer be considered a crime.

Statement from Thief River Falls Mayor Brian Holmer on behalf of Minnesotans for #Line3:  Today we again saw protestors damage property threaten workers and stop people from being able to go to work. Behind the hypocrisy of so many people using fuel to come here from around the country to try to stop a project that will make it safer to transport energy what happened today was disappointing desperation from opponents who know they are on the wrong side of facts and the reality that it makes sense to replace Line 3.  Instead of respecting the process and the community protestors instead trespassed and vandalized equipment that has impacted a Native American construction company.  Today is a day when we also need to see the forest for the trees when it comes to how people view Line 3. People who live in Northern Minnesota has seen thousands of jobs and millions in positive economic impact from construction. There are people in every county across Minnesota who support #Line3 and the last poll shows a majority of Minnesotans support the project and making sure construction continues.  Its time for the protests to stop for work to continue and to make sure Line 3 is completed.,political,Facebook
Being here when water pipes break and reviewing how Enviorlink responds to those issues. TIME. Reviewing ordinances before voting on an issue. TIME. Visiting other towns to discuss the growth issues they have already dealt with and review their successes and failures. TIME. Getting quotes for new projects or replacing existing ones. TIME. Creating a closer relationship between town hall and the citizens that pay taxes to run it. TIME. Forming working relationships with other towns to possibly share resources and contractors. Time. All of this and more takes TIME. We have seen Spring Hope for years not just hold the line with problems but steadily move backwards. I believe our current Board as well intentioned they are has a one issue they admit they have and have not presented a fix for that problem...TIME. They have done nothing wrong. These are people that have volunteered to try and help and steer Spring Hope forward. They all have full time jobs. Those jobs deserve their 100% attention to that job. Then after work and we all know how small of a window that is they want to spend with their families. I also work full time. I also love to spend time with my family as well. The difference though is that I work Friday through Sunday a majority of the time. My wife works a regular job Monday through Friday. Both of my boys are in school Monday through Friday. That leaves me here at home a majority of the week. I have the TIME to tackle the issues that currently cause Spring Hope problems. It also means Time to meet with citizens with any issues they have. A bigger window of TIME to research items being voted on. The time to brainstorm how to reduce the repair time with Enviorlink as well as the repair charges with Enviorlink. Spring Hope Commissioners have to be get more involved to solve problems. From statements made by some current Commissioners the bulk of work and future initiatives were dumped on the town manager. We can assist with his/her success by having Commissioners that are more involved with issues and not dumping anything they want done on the town manager.

"CORPORATE RESPONSIBILTY TO THE PUBLIC GOOD My philosophy as a lifelong Green Independent is that impeccable environmental stewardship is directly connected to the strength of our economy and health of our people. Our government should reflect the will of the people and design policies of economic growth that realizes private profit as a means to contribute toward the public good through fair taxation. When wealthy multinational corporations refuse to pay their fair share toward the common good through equitable taxation and when politicians enable those corporations to avoid fair taxation at the deprivation of public interest our economic and governmental structures fail us. The public can not afford any longer to clean up the environmental messes of industry. Any industry that cannot profit without damaging the environment -- that cannot incorporate environmental integrity into the true costs of doing their business -- is an industry that needs to adapt to keep up with the demands of today's world or close their books and start anew. A business model that requires harm to the environment or people is a failed model. Corporations are not private organizations entitled to the rights to do as they please -- they are granted their existences through public charters. When the public trust is broken a corporation's ""right"" to exist must always be questioned. If we can address climate change and land conservation head-on we can realize economic growth through jobs creation reduced energy costs and environmental tourism. Corporations must realize their duty to join us in this effort instead of fighting against a public interest.",political,Facebook

"Have you noticed the absence of the obnoxious journalists & reporters since Biden got elected ? I am talking of the bought and paid for democrat operatives acting as news people like Jim Acosta & Jake Tapper & Brian Stelter & the Cuomo boy..........Chris Cuomo  just to name a few. They are absent because they know that everyone knows they are fake journalists. Questioning Biden like they questioned President Trump or rather harassed him with lies and misrepresentations would be too revealing of Biden and his spokespersons & their incompetence and lies & ineptness.They would make Jen Psaki look like the nut she is & the whole Biden administration would be exposed. They would lose favor & perhaps their jobs if they crossed who holds their leash. The democrats have such plants as fake journalists in all of the MSM including the NY Times and WAPO. They also control and dictate to their giant social media servants.These organizations are an arm of the corrupt democrat party. With Trump they were eager to create false scandals and crises but with Biden they cover up his major blunders and incompetence.Just take a look at the Afghanistan debacle and mess. look at the border crisis the inflation and the Covid mess. Look at the prices of food and gas. Look at the constant lies & all the other disasters in about 7 months ! If any of this was under Trump I think he would have been crucified and I mean literally crucified. They have no shame or honor to do a job well done with honesty and integrity. They have become perverted by the democrats & are a major part of the corruption. Once the media was the watchdogs over the politicians but now they are the lapdogs of the democrat party. The few mentioned above are just a few of many more fake journalist in MSNBC ABC NBC CBS  CNN LA Times NY times & WAPO and much more including FOX. I cannot forget to mention the stellar Rachel Maddow and Don Lemon & cute blinking eyes Anderson Cooper. There are too many more to mention but they are obvious to anyone who watches the media ! One of the greatest competent men to become president Donald Trump was trashed and demonized endlessly and a real corrupt demon Joe Biden has been lionized & made into a hero despite almost 50 years of constant failures & lies and deception. With the help of the fake & dishonest journalists and fake media & the corrupt democrat machinery & soulless activists Joe Biden was supposedly the winner of the Presidential elections.

"We have all heard about the ""American Dream"" right? It means different things to different people. As parents we want our children to grow up to do well and have a better life than we did. Mayor Michael Stammel is a product of Rensselaer. He was raised in a single parent home by his mother who worked several jobs to keep her family together. Mike's mother counted on government programs to get by and Mike remembers pulling a borrowed wagon to the fire house to pick up food for the less fortunate and dragging it home to his family.  These life experiences made Mike Stammel the man he is today.  Caring compassionate and generous with his time and money Mike gives back to Rensselaer in ways that are seen and unseen.  Mike Stammel did not come from a privileged family he didn't feel entitled to anything. He worked for it. He earned it  Mike worked hard. He put himself through school and took a job at Amtrak where he would work for 41 years. travelling across the country. Mike always came home to Rensselaer. Mike raised his family coached kids in Little League and Pop Warner. The Boys and Girls Club of Rensselaer was a second home to Mike and he paid it forward by serving on the board for decades and by helping make major improvements to the Club over the years.  Mike also has served his community as a volunteer firefighter for over 40 years because protecting and serving his neighbors is important to him.  This lifetime of volunteerism led Mike to enter government service. Mike ran for Rensselaer Common Council and later ran for County Legislature where he fought to keep the Senior Center open and the Boys and Girls Club funded and much more.  In 2019 the residents of Rensselaer put their faith in this retired hometown boy to be the part time Mayor of Rensselaer where he would work as if he was a full-time mayor.  There is no greater feeling than working hard your entire life volunteering your time mentoring children and then being chosen by the people to lead the City you love.  Mike Stammel this product of Rensselaer has been humbled by this honor and has served his City with pride.  Mike's story is an American Dream. When the odds were against him Mike rose to the challenge every time and he still does it to this day.  Sadly some will make fun of Mike for his upbringing or other childish reasons. Others will criticize Mike for working hard to earn an honest living to support his family and for giving back generously to his community.  Rensselaer is better than this.  As parents we need more stories like Mike's so our children have the desire and drive to do well work harder and be better.  As Election Day nears Mike Stammel is once again humbly asking for your vote because Mike believes that Rensselaer can be better. #WeLikeMike",political,Facebook
Hey everyone  We are a group of undergraduate students at UWA currently undertaking degrees majoring in Anthropology and sociology. As some people may be aware UWA is planning to get rid of the major entirely.  Faculty are losing their jobs and students are losing their education.  Anthropology and Sociology are essential schools of thought to have at educational institutions. Recent funnelling of funding into STEM is being met with cuts to the subjects that hold researchers in this subject area accountable. The Social Sciences provide essential critical frameworks for students of all majors to analyse power identity and concepts in all areas of academic life.  This is a direct attack on the arts.

Monday Musing  This week I want to talk about my initial actions upon being elected your Sheriff.  The primary is in March 2022. Once the dust settles from that election and there are no more challengers (or run offs) I intend to immediately begin the process of planning my administration. This will be the time to begin to bring the Sheriffs Office together after a very divisive election. There are at least three different groups of supporters within the Macon County Sheriffs Office. This comes in part from those on active duty running to replace the retiring Sheriff. This is the time to reassure those who supported any other candidate that their jobs are safe from retribution for petty politics. Waiting until I am sworn in to initiate any planning will put us behind and slow our ability to ensure the transparency and efficiency I pledge.  After the election is announced the very first thing that will begin is the interview process for the position of Chief Deputy. This will be the single most important appointment within the Sheriffs Office. I will need to appoint someone who shares my vision of changes and leadership philosophy. Once this appointment is decided we will be discussing the remaining positions of leadership and who is best suited to fill those positions. As the leadership team is developed they will also be included in organizational discussions.  If possible I would like to tour the various facilities that will be within my area of responsibility. Those will include the jail and the courthouse. I would like to hear the perspectives of those who work there as to what changes need to be made.  Next I will set up meetings with the Chiefs of Police in Franklin and Highlands as well as the Chief Judge and Magistrates. I will also meet with the heads of the EMS. Again I will want to hear any concerns they may have with an incoming administration.  Finally I will begin to work on my plan to reorganize the Sheriffs Office. This will require my potential Chief Deputy and I to work closely together to ensure we can have no degradation of services once I am sworn into office.  To accomplish any of this I will not interfere with the current Administrations operations. I will if at all possible conduct any meetings with future staff in an off duty status. I will at all times respect the current Sheriff and his staff and their methods of running the department. I will not undermine one thing that is currently being accomplished by anyone on the staff.  There is only one Sheriff at a time and until December 1 2022 that is Sheriff Holland. I know that I can count on the professionalism of the current administration to ensure a smooth transition to the new administration. I know Sheriff Holland loves this organization and will want the best for it going forward.,political,Facebook

ORANGE TOWNSHIP PETTY POLITICS COULD LEAD TO INCREASING THE TAX BURDEN ON THE FAMILIES OF OLENTANGY SCHOOLS  It is no secret to anyone living in Delaware County that the bulk of property taxes fall on the shoulders of families.  One of the common-sense approaches to shift real estate tax burden from Homeowners is to encourage Smart Growth policies. Smart Growth is an approach to real estate development that includes a mix of commercial and professional development to compliment residential construction. Smart Growth attracts the types of businesses and commercial development that will ease the real estate tax burden on homeowners.  For years the Delaware County Economic Development Department and the Delaware County Finance Authority have worked in unison to help townships create Smart Growth plans that will control growth and bring prosperity to their respective areas. Despite these creative efforts to shift the real estate tax to commercial and professional development under Trustee Ben Grumbles lead Orange Township passed a resolution that effectively unraveled years of work to create an orderly development plan for the Rt. 23 corridor - a plan that would have generated millions of dollars in commercial property tax easing the tax burden to homeowners. This was a baffling contradiction as just a year prior Grumbles voted to approved that same Rt. 23 corridor overlay.  To give some background the Rt. 23 Corridor overlay was created by a consortium of Delaware County entities that wanted to see the critical north-south thoroughfare become a destination site for business and residential development with a smoother traffic flow. After careful consideration and months of studies to determine the type of growth that was needed a plan was approved for the Rt. 23 corridor overlay and supported by Trustee Ben Grumbles.  It was approved because much thought had been given to the residential-commercial mix. The planners wanted to be careful not to create too much residential development and overburden Olentangy Local Schools while adding the right blend of commercial and professional development to help ease the tax burden on families.  It was a comprehensive well-designed plan until Grumbles flip flopped and scuttled the plan. In his social media post Grumbles astonishingly questions the smart growth approach that led to the development of the overlay. Why would he pass a resolution that will mostly lead to an increase taxes for the homeowners in Orange township? Its apparent that it was the result of petty politics because it makes absolutely no sense.  The overlay was projected to create $560 million in development over the next ten years. What Grumbles did at the September 20th meeting by his vote was to erase a plan that could have created a projected $385 million in taxes from commercial and professional development coming into Delaware County including $125 million that would have been designated for Olentangy Schools.  This is just another poor decision on the part of Orange Township. Lets not forget the Amazon debacle just a few years ago.  Amazon identified a Rt. 23 parcel for building its first data center in central Ohio. Landing the data center would have created a huge commercial tax base without adding a single student to Olentangy Schools.  Also it could have incentivized other large commercial business to consider locating in Orange Township. However the Orange Township trustees fumbled the ball and rejected Amazon. Instead of the data center residential housing now occupies that parcel.  Orange Townships loss turned out to be a giant win for New Albany which landed the data center. After Amazon built its data center in western Licking County Facebook followed suit building one of the largest data centers in the world. Google followed then Amgen announced it would locate a large facility and a research & development center in the same area which will eventually bring thousands of new jobs and six-figure salaries.  Because of Amazons original investment the New Albany and western Licking County tax base has become more diversified easing the tax burden on residential homeowners. That certainly has not been the case in southern Delaware County.  That issue is now water over the dam. The issue at hand is the cancelling of the Rt. 23 Overlay. Without an overlay plan Rt. 23 will become a hodgepodge of development.,political,Facebook
"*****OPEN LETTER*****  In response to your #crimemattersmore campaign  I'm asking you to consider the reason why you became an officer in the first place. When you make statements like ""crime matters more"" your expressing that your sole purpose is fighting crime and forgetting you took an oath to protect and serve.  We can all agree that crime is an issue in Albuquerque but so is the track record of police abusing their power. It's concerning to the residents of Albuquerque (the people you swore to protect and serve) hear that you have a problem with being held accountable or disciplined for your actions when you've been proven to have a track record of disregarding that oath.  The residents of the City of Albuquerque are currently witnessing the death throws of an obsolete way of policing and it is a testament to the fact that you are part of the problem. The men and women who swore to protect and serve and meant it do their job the right way and don't fear scrutiny of their actions while doing their job. The officers who take thier job seriously care about the work they do and the role they play in the lives of everyone in the community would accept the mild disciplinary response to the failure of performing the duty they swore to. Administrative leave temporarily losing your badge and weapon while under investigation are small prices to pay for individuals who have violated and broken the trust of the people they CHOSE to protect and serve.  The reputation of APD is represented by the officers in our neighborhoods. The community wants a police force we can trust and your peers want to be colleagues capable of doing thiers jobs and both can exist at the same time.  Shaun Willoughby I'm asking you and the members of the APOA when you say crime matters more. Are you referring to:  The oath you took to protect and serve? The people in communities your serve? Black lives? Brown lives? Red lives? White lives? AAPI Lives? Homeless Lives? LGBTQ+ Lives? ""All lives""? The respect of the people in the communities you serve?  One love T. G. L. B. BNMM  P. S. The enemy of tradition is progress.  #dosomething #onelove #COMMUNITYMATTERSMORETHANYOURFEELINGS #communitymattersmore",political,Facebook
Hello everyone! Today it was announced that we will be shut down once again until at least January 11th (if it doesnt get extended even beyond that). As you may know there are hundreds of independent businesses like ours that are going to defy the governors order and reopen this weekend. We are NOT going to be one of them. While the national chains are getting rich during COVID small independents like us are going broke. And to my knowledge Park Diner has not had one single case of infection attributed to us to date. But with that said as the owner I feel that I must abide by the rules and look out for the greater public good even if it threatens our future viability.  We remain optimistic! We continue to make upgrades to the diner as limited funds will afford. Our chefs have been at work creating new homemade blue plate specials and soups as well as new sandwiches wraps and breakfast offerings. So once we get open you can try some new and fresh items on our menu.  As far as reopening I cant predict how things will go. This shutdown has been devastating to most on our staff and some have had no choice but to move on to other jobs to survive. We will reopen for as many hours as possible but it may be limited at first until we can find new talented people and get them trained up to the level you expect and deserve from us.  I will be updating you every time I have something new to report so please check back occasionally in the next few weeks. If you dont hear from us before the end of the year all of us at Park Diner wish you a healthy and prosperous 2021!! Thank you for your ongoing support!,political,Facebook

Letter to the Editor Imker Addresses the City as to Why He is Running for Mayor  Peachtree City has been my home for 18 years. Together well address our traffic issues stop taxing residents out of their homes and protect our village concept. Lets not burst the Peachtree City bubble.  I am an engineer and computer scientist but most importantly I am a professional program manager. Being popular is not a qualification for being mayor. You dont need to be a rocket scientist either but I have worked on the Space Shuttle.  Im a twice elected former City Council member. Ive led successful multi-million dollar projects with the Air Force Star Wars NASA GM and even Panasonic here in town. Having supervised hundreds of people gives me unique qualifications to set the course for our city.  Most importantly though I know the citizens. I actually get out there and talk with them at various venues around the city. Hence the 50+ meet and greet campaign stops over the last two months. I encourage questions. I enjoy interacting with citizens. But it wont end there. Unlike other politicians who only come out during election season I will continue to hold meet and greets throughout my four years as mayor. I will encourage HOAs to invite me to their meetings so I can hear firsthand what is on the citizens minds. I will continue to make myself available for chats all around the city with hopefully weekly opportunities at various locations.  Things we need to do include returning authority back to our Planning Commission the way it was before city council so unwisely neutered it. The Planning Commission must have the power to hold public hearings so that developers cannot simply bypass our most experienced citizens who know our zoning and planning rules much better than any city council member.  STOP rezoning industrial to residential. We have enough residential. Residential costs the city money by way of supplying police fire first responder road and cart path maintenance recreation and all the other amenities we offer our citizens. The taxes from residential fall well short of paying for all that. Every council member knows this yet they have been on a tear rezoning everything to residential everywhere you look. Industry brings new money and new jobs into Peachtree City. Industry is obviously a financial gain thereby allowing us to potentially lower our millage rate.  We need to stop destroying the wildlife and clear cutting forests to build more commercial and apartments we don't need. If you want to live on top of somebody there is a city 20 miles north of us thats just what youre looking for. Protect our village concept. Keep and expand green spaces. Return village signs to roads leading into those villages. Make our city sophisticated again.  Our millage rate is simply not competitive to other cities. City council raised taxes each of the last three years. Sure they were small amounts but it sends the wrong message to industry. Industry sees how easily taxes are raised here they see how high our rates are and choose to go elsewhere. I would. Of course this year being an election year the council decided not to raise taxes. How predictable! Last year we had a budget of $40M. It was known well before this last summer our revenue would be about $6.5M MORE than anticipated. Yet the city council was unable to lower our millage rate. This is extremely disturbing. It shows a clear lack of awareness. We have plenty of money now to pay for employee raises lower our stormwater bills and still have enough to lower our taxes. Anyone who says we cant afford a tax cut is simply a defeatist.  Lack of policies on any traffic improvement over the last 8 years has been hard to watch. We were promised by certain council members now running for mayor that this issue would be addressed. The result has unfortunately been less than desired. There are ways to make improvement but it seems only during election time does this become a concern for sitting council members. That stops now. Traffic improvement solutions will be a major and continuous city council concern.  Golf cart path safety also seems to only be a concern during election season. I'm glad we finally have a committee looking into it now.  Another major discontent is the lack of ability to understand project management and how to control costs. Way too many projects have drastically overrun their budgeted costs. I could list six of them right now costing us millions and millions in overruns but that is better left for another letter. You dont know about this because the city council doesnt want you to know. I have done literally dozens of open records requests to find out the true story. It is not a pretty picture. Indeed it is outright disastrous. I will be the most transparent mayor and lead the next city council into being the most transparent this city has ever seen. I have nothing to hide and I want the citizens to know both the good and the bad of whats happening. Its your money. You deserve to know exactly how its being spent. SPLOST projects will become a routine agenda item at every council meeting. SPLOST (the 1% extra sales tax) is equivalent to  of the entire city annual budget. You need to know if your $10M/yr is being spent wisely. I will ensure you know.  Clearly the city council knows its role is setting policy. But we need to be better at instilling discipline into the other part of the role. That is oversight. We have lost control financially of way too many projects due to lack of program management skills on city council. I have the absolute 100% most experience in managing people and projects with successful results of bringing those projects in on time AND on budget. Over the last few years the city council has let millions of dollars slip down the preverbal rabbit hole. Honestly it irks me seeing this happen because in 2010 when I first got on council we were scraping and begging for every dollar. Nowadays it seems throwing a hundred thousand dollars here and there means nothing. This must stop so we can properly deliver services with our precious citizens tax money.  I will listen to all sides of an issue and encourage my fellow council members to do the same. Making time at council meetings to hear our citizens comments is important. The two minute time limit for citizen comment is an insult to our citizens. I will simply ask them not to repeat themselves or others and be respectful.  National pride is an important value I want to inspire in everyone. I realize we are a small community but we are part of the United States. Over the last several years weve seen our mainstream news media Hollywood types educational types and high tech internet social media including search engines attempt to manipulate and socialize not just our younger generation but everyone. (I generalized here and recognize Not all.)  How can the citizens of Peachtree City support a candidate that supports organizations that want to burn the American flag defund the police and think rioting burning and looting is justified for social equality?  I hope this is a generational cyclic occurrence like weve had in the past. Im concerned we may be going over the edge and will lose our country. Pray for us for we have been given the greatest nation ever to exist on the planet. Theres a reason millions of people come north instead of going south to Venezuela to the socialistic h*ll hole theyve created for themselves down there. People want our freedom opportunities and justice for all. We have been blessed with all of this as United States citizens. Lets not lose it.  Some more thoughts on traffic and protecting our village concept.  Traffic during rush hours at GA54/74 is horrendous. You have 15-20 light cycle waits with backups down to Lake Peachtree. The problem is the five traffic lights west of that intersection. Beginning with the light at the Avenue when it turns red for westbound GA54 traffic everything stops. I see it you see it how come the city council doesnt see it? Theyve done literally nothing in the last 8 years to address the problem. In fact two of my opponents were on city council with me in 2014 and voted to make things worse by approving yet another light between Walmart and MacDuff Parkway. GDOT sent us a letter saying dont do it because it will make matters worse. Yet these council members voted to do it inserting their idea of government prowess into private business decisions. No! It is not the governments job to pick winners and losers. Governments job is to provide a fair playing field for businesses to make their own choices. Adding that additional traffic light allowed the developer to walk away with millions extra while we got worse traffic issues to deal with.  This total waste of spending $12M on a crazy crossover lane change idea on north/south GA74 will do nothing to solve the east/west GA54 problem. Address the GA54 problem and you dont get the GA74 issues.  Stop allowing traffic to turn right on red from GA74 onto GA54. Then only during rush hour keep the Avenue light green for GA54. Get that traffic moving and you reduce the blocking the block issues. Sure you inconvenience a few dozen folks coming out of the Avenue but they can go around. You make it so thousands of Peachtree City citizens who wont go out on GA54 during rush hour can enjoy our own roads again.  There are many other plans we can implement to improve traffic. Solve it no but we can improve it. Of course the long term solution is a northern bypass between PTC and Tyrone. I have talked to the Coweta County Commissioner of the area bordering PTC and we agree a long term solution of a bypass is needed. Protecting our village concept includes NO to more dense pack housing apartments etc. Like I said if you want to live on top of somebody else theres a city 20 miles north of Peachtree City that has what youre looking for.  We need to stop rezoning all our industrial land to residential. Again these same two opponents of mine now (who voted for the additional traffic light on GA54) voted to rezone 86 acres of industrial land to dense pack residential along a railroad track. Good grief. What were they thinking? They werent. I said its perfect for 6 to 8 small industrial plots with perhaps 50-100 employees each. This would bring new jobs and new money into the city. The famous MacDuff bridge over the railroad track included a curb cut to allow a service road to go down along the railroad track to service those small industries. Those industries would never have been seen from MacDuff Parkway because all the trees would still be there. Trucks would never be on MacDuff because theyd shoot out to GA74. Instead we got a clear cut of 86 acres of trees thanks to that vote.  Remember when my opponents say protect the village concept they voted the opposite.  When my opponents say traffic solutions they voted the opposite.  There are other clear differences between me and my opponents. I have the experience of working and directing people in both large and small organizations. I have worked with dozens of PhD scientists on the real Star Wars effort ($1B+) to leading Boy Scouts for eight years. I have the breadth of experience no one else has. I have advanced degrees in Engineering Computer Systems and Program Management. No else can say anything close.  I have the proven financial expertise that helped bring Peachtree City from a $22M deficit in 2010 to a balanced budget in 2015. That is why I voluntarily did not run for another term for city council though I was eligible to run. I stepped down saying I accomplished what I set out to do I.e. bring our city back to a financially sound ground. Tough choices had to be made and I made them. No one else in recent memory has voluntarily stepped down as a council member. They all seem to want to be career politicians for 8 years as a council member then 8 more years as Mayor. This is wrong. They need to step aside like I did and allow others to have the privilege and honor of being a council member.  I am most curious as to all the lawsuits the city is currently facing. Nobody knows. I guess Ill have to do more open records requests.  I arrived in Peachtree City in 2003 and worked at Panasonic until 2007. Since then I have been involved with our community in various ways. They include:  Peachtree City Recreation Commissioner 2008-2009 Elected twice as City Councilmember 2009 (2 years) & 2011 (4 years) Master Mason in Peachtree City since 2012 Peachtree City Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) Graduate 2016 Renewed CPR Certification 2016 Georgia Sheriffs Association Honorary Member since 2017 Worthy Patron Eastern Star since 2019 Fayette County Humane Society Foster Cat Inspector (2019-2020) American Legion Post #50 Peachtree City GA since 2019 Director Peachtree City Monopoly Tournament since 2009 (Over $20000 cash and prizes given away  no entry fee!) Director Peachtree City Golf Cart Scavenger Hunt since 2020 ($1000 cash given away  no entry fee!) Donations to Masonic Childrens Home Donations to Church Boy Scouts Rainbow Girls DeMolay Boys Facebook People in Need of Donations Stop Smoking Intervention Donations Clothes Less Traveled & Goodwill Donations  I am not running for the salary. Instead I will donate the salary over four years as mayor of $86400 back to the city. I also do not accept campaign contributions. I consider holding the mayors job to be a privilege. Id rather give back to the city rather than take away from it. I will always have the best interests of the citizens in mind. My only financial interest in Peachtree City is my home. This leads to the point that I am not beholden to anyone nor any business nor any developer nor any political party. Remember my opponents funding sources for their campaigns and ask yourself will their decisions be in the best interest of Peachtree City? My decisions as mayor will ensure our community is the best place to live in the country.,political,Facebook
"Hello Friends of Stylish Living. I have not posted anything about the proposed Downtown Plan because I hoped the discussions Tom and I had with town officials and the discussions other business owners had with same would prevent them from moving forward with the portion that will greatly affect businesses on N Salem Street between Chatham and Saunders St. (from Anna's & The Peak on Salem). I cannot be silent about this any longer as the town council voted last night to move forward with REMOVING 20 of the 30 on-street parking spaces in order to widen the sidewalks for more outdoor dining. Additionally behind the buildings where employees park trash & recycling trucks traverse fire trucks return to their station semi-trucks drive in to make deliveries maintenance vehicles park to provide services etc. those areas are being wiped out in order to make public gathering spaces. We already see with the park-to-dine program that outdoor tables are not used a large portion of the day due to weather issues or restaurants not serving lunch or dinner at different times of the day or week while businesses are open and need those spaces for their customers. Certain officials repeatedly cite ""overwhelming support"" and high percentage support for their plan but as can be read in their published manual about the plan which can be found on the Town of Apex website that support equates in numbers to .029% of the population. That is a miniscule number to cause disruption to the charming authentic historic and vibrant downtown that won Apex the Best Place to Live award in 2015 and continues to bring in new residents/taxpayers from all over the country (and world). I spoke at the Special Session of the Town Council last night and will include my presentation below. The many customers that I have spoken with about this plan have reacted with dismay at why they would want to remove the on-street parking. The retailers and business owners who oppose this portion of the plan are rightly concerned that the only businesses who will survive this will be bars and restaurants. Council members who clearly stated that they were concerned about the needs of the businesses and wanted more parking were essentially overpowered by the words and voice volume of Brett Gantt and Terry Mahaffey who obviously wanted to get this done while they are still in office despite the desires of the REAL majority and the customers of the businesses who have invested hundreds of thousands of dollars into our downtown and countless community-wide fundraisers schools medical causes and more. What incensed me the most is Brett Gantt's smug comment last night: ""I think the comments about this being a bar and restaurant district are going to be a REALITY"" and ""it will inevitable happen."" Yes Mister Beers With Brett IT WILL HAPPEN if you stay in office and continue to get your feedback from people just like you. We will no longer be there to supply countless families with a safe clean family environment. I find it a bit ironic that he is a statistician by profession but he believes that .029% of the population equates to overwhelming support. FRIENDS OF STYLISH LIVING I KNOW YOU AND I DON'T BELIEVE YOU WANT DOWNTOWN APEX TO BECOME A BAR AND RESTAURANT ""ENTERTAINMENT"" DISTRICT AND THIS IS NOT WHY YOU ARE IN APEX. PLEASE SEND A MESSAGE TO THE MAYOR AND TOWN COUNCIL TO LET THEM KNOW YOU WILL NOT STAND FOR THIS.  *****Here is the speech I gave last night***** I AM LINDA LAND OWNER OF STYLISH LIVING  MY HUSBAND AND I MET INDIVIDUALLY WITH YOU IN MAY AND HAVE SPOKEN WITH THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT MEMBERS AND STANTEC CONSULTANTS.  WE EXPRESSED OUR OPPOSITION TO THE PORTION OF THE PLAN THAT ELIMINATES ON-STREET PARKING BETWEEN CHATHAM AND SAUNDERS AS WELL AS CHANGING THE AREAS BETWEEN SEABOARD STREET AND THE BUSINESSES FROM A BUSINESS OPERATIONS SPACE TO A PUBLIC GATHERING SPACE.  I HAVE COME TO VIEW THIS AS A COURT CASE WITH THE TOWN COUNCIL MEMBERS AS THE JURY. YOU WILL MAKE A DETERMINATION OF WHICH VIEWPOINT HOLDS THE BEST EVIDENCE.  THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT HAS PRESENTED THEIR CASE:  THERE WAS COMMUNITY OUTREACH WHICH PRODUCED 135 PEOPLE AT THE FIRST OPEN HOUSE AND 143 PEOPLE AT THE FINAL PRESENTATION I WOULD GUESS MANY OF THE SAME PEOPLE ATTENDED BOTH MEETINGS.

REGARDLESS OF THEIR RECOMMENDATION THEY WILL KEEP THEIR JOBS.  THE OPPOSITION BEING SEVERAL RETAILERS AND BUSINESS OWNERS IN THE AFFECTED AREA HAVE PRESENTED THEIR CASE.  THE TOWN HAS A POPULATION OF ABOUT 70000 EVEN IF THE MEETING ATTENDEES AND ONLINE SURVEY RESPONDENTS WERE DIFFERENT PEOPLE THAT IS JUST .029% OF THE POPULATION WE ASKED FOR SOMEONE TO GIVE US ONE EXAMPLE OF A PLACE SIMILAR TO APEX WHERE THIS HAS BEEN DONE AND IT IS A SUCCESS. NOBODY HAS BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE ONE NOT EVEN STANTEC WHO HAS OFFICES IN 41 STATES THERE ARE AN AVERAGE OF 34 DAYS PER YEAR WITH TEMPERATURES OVER 90 DEGREES AND 90 DAYS PER YEAR WITH HIGH TEMPERATURES UNDER 60 DEGREES THAT IS AN AVERAGE OF 124 DAYS THAT IT IS NOT CONDUCIVE TO EATING OUTSIDE BASED ON TEMPERATURES ALONE THERE ARE 107 RAINY DAYS ON AVERAGE PER YEAR IT IS DARK AT DINNERTIME FROM NOVEMBER TO MARCH NOT ALL RESTAURANTS IN THE AFFECTED AREA SERVE BOTH LUNCH AND DINNER AND NOT ALL ARE OPEN 7 DAYS PER WEEK WE ARE OPEN EVERYDAY OR 64 HOURS PER WEEK WE PROVIDED EVIDENCE OF WHAT HAPPENED TO MANY PLACES WHEN PARKING WAS REMOVED FROM STOREFRONTS WE PROVIDED EVIDENCE THAT PARKED CARS ARE A TRAFFIC CALMING FACTOR AND A SAFETY FACTOR BETWEEN PEOPLE ON THE SIDEWALK AND MOVING THROUGH TRAFFIC. WE HAVE ASKED OUR CUSTOMERS AND THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY PARKING WOULD BE REMOVED.  IF PARKING IS REMOVED THERE IS GOOD PROBABILITY BASED ON FACTUAL INFORMATION THAT OUR BUSINESS WILL SUFFER IF NOT CLOSE.  TOWN COUNCIL PLEASE DONT EXPERIMENT WITH OUR BUSINESSES AND OUR CHARMING AUTHENTIC AND VIBRANT DOWNTOWN IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE THE WISHES OF .029% OF THE POPULATION WHO LIKELY DONT HAVE BUSINESS EXPERIENCE.

The airport board is putting energy into the airport for the first time in 30 years to try to complete with me and if they wouldve put as much energy into this airport for the last 30 years as they did keeping me from having a pumpkin drop this year Noble county airport would be really something special! However they have neglected their jobs for the last 30 years and it really needs some work to get it back into shape! Unfortunately at this time the policy that Noble County Airport Authority has put into place gives them the ability to approve or deny the event with the vote/ say so of the airport board manager so  after making him do his job for the first time in 30 years it is very unlikely that Im going to get a positive response back from him but in the best interest of Noble Countys youth and general aviation I am going to try!,political,Facebook
Hello America: Over the last few weeks hundreds of thousands of Americans have either lost their jobs or had their jobs threatened by the Biden Administration while at the same time allowing hundreds of thousands of Illegal aliens have been invited into our Nation. Yes our Constitutional Republic was built by legal immigrants who came to our Nation with hopes of a better life. If we allow the government to continue on this path of destruction there may be no coming back. If you love your love this country and your Constitutional rights get involved join the cause and make a difference.,political,Facebook
Are the good times really over for good? Folks we are the shining light the country needs to get through these hard times. People (most on the right side of the spectrum) belittle companies and people for mask mandates and vaccinations. I personally do not support the masks or vaccinations being pushed by companies or the government. But keep in mind my friends these are all privately owned companies and can do whatever they want with their own company. Just as much as the mom and pop corner store can dictate the terms of service. This is the (in my personal opinion) best thing about capitalism. We can Choose to use that company or products if we do not agree with the company. We have so many options with all of the technology to buy products or services with companies that hold your personal values. If you dont want to buy from Walmart because they may require masks then go to the local grocery store where they dont. If you work where they mandate masks or the shot there are an abundance of jobs that are so very short of workers you can make a healthy wage. Same goes for any situation. If a company supports something you do not value I assure you there are other companies and service providers that share your values. I know Im some cases especially is you are in a major city where every company is for the lack of a better term so far left they have left the country (Ronald Regan) then if you are able get away. But the people politics and whole country are as an old friend of mine said like a pendulum. It will go way to the right. Then it will swing to the middle then to the left. Like before 9/11 then that terrible tragedy happened the country as a general whole went right. We have swung far left now. We need to bring it back. Supporting businesses that support you voting for people that support you and first and foremost treat others as you want to be treated. You or I may not agree with the protester crying for whatever cause they may believe in. But remember they believe in their cause just like you and I believe in our cause. The only way to make your point is to show them your point and how it ends and show them how their means end. On a separate note I will be posting much more in the future so show your friends and family. Have discussions and think about how you treat people. You may not like the person in the front of the store telling you to put your mask on but remember that person is working when most chose not too he more than likely does not want to tell you that and he may not agree with the mask rule but they are people just like us and he is choosing to work rather than collect money and sit home. God bless us and God bless America.  The Lone Conservative.,political,Facebook
There are some things from last nights meet and greet that I think need a little more in-depth explanation so you the voter can make a better-informed decision. I apologize in advance for the length of this but I had several thoughts I felt called to put in front of you. Please take the time to read it even if it takes several sittings. Im still going door to door and I hope to finish that process soon but early voting starts September 17th and this is one of the best forums to reach lots of people quickly. If you like what I have to say let me know. Like and share this page. If not and you have concerns please reach out and give me the opportunity to address them before you cast your vote. Thanks for opportunity and again my apologizes for the lack of brevity.  I have known my opponent for several years with our paths crossing numerous times both in our private lives as well as our professional ones. We have lots of mutual friends and I share their respect for him and all the things he has done for this community. I hope that respect is mutual and remains at the end of this campaign regardless of the outcome. He said early on that he is running this race for the office not against anyone and I concur.  We both have a history of community service having coached sports served on boards and committees and done lots of other things with the goal of making Bristol a safe and enjoyable place to live.  He is running as an independent candidate and I as a Republican. He did not get the opportunity to explain why he is running as an independent Monday night; five minutes is not much time nor did I get to explain why I am running as a Republican. I think the public has a right to know what they are getting in an elected official and the party I most identify with is the Republican Party. I believe in small government especially at the federal level believing we do a much better job of governing ourselves at the local level. I believe in being fiscally responsible a belief that is especially important in our community at the present time. I believe in our Constitution and the rights it affords us. I am a staunch supporter of the Bill of Rights and believe the 2nd Amendment gives us the ability to insure we are able to freely exercise the remaining rights. I am an NRA life member a concealed carry permit holder and I enjoy teaching people to safely and properly exercise their right to own and carry a firearm. I have strong moral convictions rooted in my Christian upbringing and faith and think we are best served by treating people fairly but holding them accountable for their actions. I believe in being transparent and forthcoming and in making sure Im available to the public to answer their questions or address their concerns. I believe elected officials should remain accountable to the people who elected them and not abuse their office or the public trust. These qualities are not always the most important factors to voters at the local level. In this election many of you are being asked to choose between two people whom you know maybe well maybe only peripherally. Sometimes votes are cast simply because you have known someone for a long time and believe they will do a good job. I realize that but when people cast a vote for someone they should have as much information possible regarding where that person stands on the issues they see as important their background and their qualifications for the office they seek. I believe I best serve that philosophy by running as a party candidate.  We both have a history of law enforcement service; he with 21 years with BVPD me with 29 years with BTPD. But our law enforcement careers have taken different paths and it is that difference that I think has provided me with the knowledge and experience necessary to lead the BVSO into the future. I have more than 19 years of supervisory experience and almost 15 years of experience at the managerial level. The Sheriff is responsible for lots of things that additional experience has prepared me for. Ive drawn up and managed budgets written grants developed and implemented policy developed and implemented training dealt with a wide variety of personnel issues developed schedules and staffing plans developed bid specifications and purchased equipment and lots of other things that have prepared me to be the next Sheriff. While I have had lots of help and mentorship during my career I did these things on my own and have many years of experience doing them.  Education wise I have both an AES degree from Tri-Cities State Technical Institute as well as BS from ETSU in General Studies. While Im proud of the fact I earned that BS degree while working full-time as a detective as well as being a full-time father and coaching several sports I am most proud of graduating from the Southern Police Institute in 2001 at the top of my class academically. Out of almost 60 students I was the only one that did not have rank. Several in my class were deputy chiefs majors or captains. We even had one Chief. Those same people also voted for me to receive the class leadership award. That achievement has only been duplicated a very few times in SPIs history of almost 150 classes. John Austin and two members of his staff are also SPI graduates as well as one of BTPDs new Majors.  I am humbled to have the support of the three prior Sheriffs. Two of them of have contributed to my campaign financially. The two that live in the City have supported me by allowing me to put a sign in their yard and have pledged to vote for me. In addition I have received support from many of the current and former employees of both the Sheriffs Office and the Police Department as well as people who work within the criminal justice system. I have relied heavily on their wisdom and guidance in managing this campaign and making plans for the future should this campaign be successful. As some of you may know the entire command staff of the Sheriffs Office has either retired or has plans to do so at the end of this year. This makes it even more important the next Sheriff has some administrative and managerial expertise going into the office. It will take time to fill those positions and train the selected personnel to do their job. Even if the jail is closed that process will not happen overnight. The responsibility for running the jail properly will still be there. One misinformed decision can seal the fate of the jail and/or cost the taxpayers money we can ill afford. I have talked with some of these people and feel I have if elected convinced them to stay at least for a short period to allow an orderly transition.  My opponent addressed the jail issue and his hopes in being able to retain it. It is no secret that I want to see us maintain a jail here as well and feel doing away with it completely is a short-sighted decision and one we will likely regret. But having spent time talking about this with the two most recent Sheriffs I feel I have a better grasp of this issue than my opponent. He stated he wants to try and see what the cost would be to renovate and/or expand the current jail at its present location. Both those options have already been explored and deemed too costly. The jail is currently grandfathered from having to meet current Department of Corrections (DOC) regulations in lots of different categories. Should the City choose to renovate we run the risk coming out from under those grandfathered regulations and thus losing certification. If that happens we have no choice but to find somewhere else to put our inmates at least until we come into compliance. This would make the decision on what we do with the jail even more a matter of dollars than it is now. Frankly I believe this is one of the fears that is driving the move to the regional jail system and I cannot discount it as a valid one. Any work to the current facility needs to be done in a manner that insures we stay under the grandfathered regulations. It does not mean we cannot renovate but it severely limits the extent of those renovations. I do not like to deal in absolutes but I do not see a way we can upgrade the capacity of the current facility without running afoul of DOC regulations.  I think as did Sheriff Maples that we can spend some money keep the grandfathered certification and keep the current facility open for a few more years. If we can achieve this we save some of the jobs and we keep our police officers in Bristol instead of them having to drive to the other side of Abingdon to process their arrestees. We buy ourselves time to explore other options. Im not sure Bristol Virginia will ever be able to afford nearly $100 million to build a new jail. With close to that amount in current debt it will be years before we could even contemplate it and that is years of increased tax revenue from the casino and associated development being put towards paying down our current debt. Never mind that we also need to spend money to update our schools and other infrastructure. We went almost a year with an inoperable elevator in our courthouse. Our police department just recently was able to replace patrol cars with more than 100000 miles on them. These are the vehicles they rely on to respond to your 9-1-1 calls in a safe manner. We have lots of things to address the jail being only one of a long laundry list of infrastructure needs and capital projects that have been put on hold because of our current financial situation.  Ive researched this issue myself and am encouraged by a couple of things. The Virginia Sheriffs Association is lobbying to restore 50% funding to localities seeking to build new jails. Should that happen I think we are just a few years away from being able to afford building a 200-250 bed jail. Yes this would mean housing a percentage of our jail population elsewhere but it is my hope we can come to an agreement with the regional jail authority and contract with them for a specified number of beds. Obviously this will come at an increased cost but it is my hope those costs can be covered with increased sales and entertainment tax revenues and not as an additional property tax burden to our residents. Some of those costs will be covered by the State and the benefit is we keep control of our jail save jobs and retain control of the programs we can provide to the jail population. With proper planning I would hope we could design a facility that could be upgraded as monies become available eventually negating the need to house prisoners elsewhere giving us better control over expenses. Ive also identified some limited opportunities for grant funding that could possibly be used to make some needed upgrades to the current jail without running afoul of the DOC giving us the time we need to better research plan and prepare for the future. We need time to build a capital improvement account to fund at least a portion of the cost of a new jail. If this comes to fruition and we can reduce the current population at the city jail to a manageable level we increase the safety of both the inmates and our deputies. We gain the ability to make some much needed repairs that currently cannot be done safely. We may lose some positions at the Sheriffs Office but I believe those can be eliminated though attrition rather than by having to lay-off employees. We can also begin to re-establish services to the inmates that have had to be curtailed due to the current jail population.  I do not think building on the current site is viable option for lots of different reasons. Unfortunately that means moving the jail elsewhere in the City. I like my opponent intend to look at this option further but based on my conversations with both former Sheriff Maples and former Sheriff Weisenburger this seems to be a cost-prohibitive option with lots of complications.  Why am I so adamant about maintaining a jail here in the City? If the jail goes away completely approximately 50 employees will be laid off. Some of those may be absorbed by the regional jail but there is no guarantee as to the number nor is there any agreement regarding seniority transferring. There are several employees who have stayed through all this uncertainty and they deserve to know what their future will look like. Some of them are within a few years of securing their retirement.  From a public safety aspect I do not like the long transport times approximately 30 minutes one way to the regional jail. Currently if an officer is at our jail and his shift mates need help he can leave and be about anywhere in the city within five minutes. If something really bad happens the police department can call on the deputies to come help. They also help with special events such as Rhythm and Roots. When that staff is laid off the burden of staffing those events will fall solely on an already over-burdened police force. Yes we can add additional officers but at what cost? How many would we need to maintain our current level of service? Sheriffs Office employees salaries are covered by the State Compensation Board police officer salaries come out of the general fund which comes from taxes paid by those who live and shop in the City. There is no cost savings in eliminating the jail if we must increase the expenditure of tax dollars to continue to keep our community safe and insure calls for service are answered in a timely manner. Im not convinced these issues have been adequately addressed in this plan to move to the regional jail.  With a jail located in the City and staffed by BVSO employees we control the programs provided to the inmates. Their families are better able to come visit them. Our police officers are better able to gain access for interviews. We eliminate concerns with transport times and issues with driving a combative arrestee to the regional jail. We keep a pool of additional law enforcement personnel available to handle both special events and crisis situations.  Im a big proponent of working with the inmates to lower recidivism rates finding alternatives to incarceration for those charged with non-violent crimes and working in other ways to lower the daily jail population without sacrificing public safety. My opponent and I both have experience with drug court. This is one way we currently work to keep people out of jail. This program has had it successes and is one we should be proud of. I would work with our courts to insure this program remains viable to try and increase the number of participants and to provide those participants with the resources they need to successfully complete the program.  One of the biggest issues facing not just law enforcement but society as whole is how to best serve our mentally ill. We have very few mental health hospital beds. Officers often spend days guarding people who have been committed or worse yet because they have little other choice they end up jailing them for public nuisance offenses such as trespassing or public intoxication. Jailing these people is a short-term answer not a solution to a long-term problem. We need to fix our mental health system and provide a way for these people to be treated without treating them as criminals and incarcerating them. There are numerous studies that show the cost of treatment is at the very least comparable to the cost of incarceration and in many cases is lower. I heard Glenn Youngkin speak on this topic the other night and was encouraged by his promise to work on a fix should he be elected. While I do not have specific numbers I would dare say based on both personal experience and the numerous studies that have been conducted across the country that a large portion of our jail population would be better able to return to being a productive member of society if they were able to receive proper mental health care rather than a jail sentence.  Do not mistake compassion and empathy for an attitude of being soft on crime. There are also people in our jails who have proven time and again they have no respect for our society and its laws. They are predators pure and simple and our community is safer when they are incarcerated. As Sheriff I would do everything in my power to help identify these offenders and insure they receive sentences equivalent to their crime. One of the strategies that has a proven track record of reducing crime rates especially violent crime is to identify these persistent offenders and work with the courts to keep them off the streets. This was one of my responsibilities during the time I was administrator of our Project Safe Neighborhoods grant and something I have continued to work on since. We have been able to take some very violent career criminals off the streets using this strategy and it is something I would work on with our police and prosecutors if elected.  While our jail situation has hampered efforts to serve a large number of outstanding arrest warrants and capiases it is my belief people should be held accountable for their crimes. I am hopeful that as Sheriff I can work with my staff the courts the Commonwealth Attorneys Office and our police department to find a way to serve these that does not add to the urgency of our jail situation.  In talking with the current staff one of the major issues in recruiting and retaining staff is their current work schedule. Because the jail must be staffed 24/7/365 scheduling options are limited. We cannot simply close it on the weekends and let the inmates fend for themselves. For the staff under their current work schedule this means newer employees end up with fixed days off. This usually means they have to take vacation time to have a weekend off to attend a kids ball game or take a trip to Dollywood. This coupled with the uncertainty surrounding the jail has resulted in numerous vacancies within the office. I believe a rotating days off schedule is a viable option and would be one of the first things I would address upon taking office.  Outside of that it would be my intention to meet with the current staff both collectively and individually to get their input on what they see as the issues facing the jail as well as their ideas on addressing them. I began this process several months ago and I have received some great suggestions from them but feel the process would be even more productive as Sheriff rather than as a candidate.  It would be foolish to rush in and begin changing things without first getting an idea of the processes already in place how well they work and what changes could be implemented to increase safety and efficiency without creating additional issues or work. Having training in the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) having dealt with personnel issues for the better part of my career and having leadership and managerial experience I have great appreciation for how changing things simply for the sake of change can create issues.  I do appreciate the value of training and developing personnel and it is my intention to provide some of that training to the current staff. One of the things I did when Sheriff Maples first took office was provide active shooter training to a good portion of his staff especially those working in the courthouse. Should an incident occur at the courthouse the staff there as well as personnel working at the jail would be the first to confront the situation. This training was conducted for a very minimal cost and could be repeated for the entire staff. Dealing with the mentally ill is another area I identified as a training need at my current department and fortunately there are several organizations in our community that can provide this training to the staff at no cost. Due to my extensive experience in law enforcement developing lesson plans and conducting training on a wide variety of topics I think there are many similar opportunities to provide career development opportunities to the staff. I believe much of this can be done in-house without increasing training or personnel costs. This would be something I would begin working on day one. Lack of relevant training is also one of the issues brought up by many of the current employees.  On Monday I said Im not seeking an office or a title Im seeking a job. I wish I could take credit for that sentiment but it actually came from Glenn Youngkin. It resonated with me and does a great job of explaining why I am running. My parents instilled a hardy work-ethic in me. I started mowing yards when I was 11 years old and the only time I have been without some form of income producing job since was the two years I attended Tri Cities State Tech. It was their insistence I concentrate on my education but I had a job within a week of graduating and I have not been without one since. For the last 15 years I have been a salaried employee but that has not stopped me from working 60 hour weeks when the need was there to do so. I relish a challenge and this job will most likely be nothing but challenges at least initially and most definitely until we resolve the jail issue. I see the job of Sheriff much as I see my current job; someone who works for the citizens with the goal of making our community as safe as possible while protecting the interests of everyone. Personnel are our biggest asset and when they are well-trained confident in their job and respected they do their jobs more efficiently and effectively and they stay for longer periods of time. One of the basic tenets of leadership is employees leave bosses not jobs. I intend to be an approachable boss who is willing to listen and at least explore ideas and suggestions from both employees and the public. When an office holder is responsive and transparent they gain both public trust and support. That does not mean they always hear the answer they are seeking but they do get an answer.  Ive refrained from making many promises during this campaign. It would be unwise to do so until I have a better grasp of a complex job with many moving parts. The one thing I have promised and the promise I make to you the voters here I will give maximum effort and I wont quit until the task at hand has been completed. This is not about fulfilling some career goal attaining a title or cushioning my retirement. If that were the case I would have applied to be Chief of Police or Major at my current department. I passed despite having the qualifications to be competitive for both to concentrate on this campaign and to assure the voters I mean it when I say I want to be Sheriff.  If you made it this far I hope I have convinced you to cast your vote for me in this election. Your support would be greatly appreciated. If I havent and you still arent decided please reach out and give me an opportunity to answer and lingering questions you may have.  Respectfully  Charlie,political,Facebook
Official press release: For Immediate Release:  Liedtky to Wesco: Apologize for Diminishing Deaths of 3500 Hoosiers  Indianas State House race between incumbent Tim Wesco and challenger Ryan Liedtky has grown more intense as we head to the final month of this election cycle. On Thursday Tim Wesco diminished the deaths of 3500 Hoosiers who lost their lives to COVID-19 by insinuating it is more important we talk about smoking than an on-going pandemic. Liedtky called for Rep. Wesco to apologize to those families as well as all the families who have lost jobs struggled with paying their bills and suffered mental and emotional pain due to the ongoing crisis.  We mourn for all loss of life Liedtky said. We want to see an end to all deaths caused by smoking and secondhand smoke. That is why we enact laws that ban smoking in cars with children ban smoking within 8 feet of public entrances and require businesses post signage to indicate they allow smoking.  Liedtky then suggested that he not Wesco is the true pro-life candidate. When a person does not want to take common sense measures to pro-long and preserve life they cannot be considered pro-life regardless of their stance on abortion. Because I believe in these common sense measures on smoking and COVID and because I believe in helping every Hoosier ensure they have access to healthcare food and housing I am the only candidate who values life at every stage.  Liedtky then called out poor leadership in Indiana government. Unfortunately we have not seen great leadership at many levels through this. We have seen policy men who cannot adapt to the challenges that lay ahead and who fail to give guidance to those who seek it.  Liedtky concluded by stating I believe in the America that loves us protects us serves us welcomes us comforts us guides us and unites us.,political,Facebook
"Why Do I Self-Identify as a Liberal Republican especially these days?  A friend asked me this again today.  So thought I would reshare this post (slightly edited) from the www.theloneliberalrepublican.org website.  This whole quixotic project is geared towards tilling ground to restore the Republican Party to the balance it has had through most of its historynot RINO politics just what the Republican Party has actually been historically.  For many of us who regard ourselves as somewhere in the middle politically I believe that there are two major issues that separate most who would identify as Republicans from those who would identify as Democrats.  The first is whether we regard the government or the private sector as more capable of handling most problems with Republicans generally arguing for private sector solutions and Democrats leaning to government ones. I identify as a Liberal Republican because I believe that good public education and public safety (national defense and domestic policing and incarceration) are best handled by the government but most else like housing and job creation are better handled by the private sector. I believe that government regulation is important but should be simple clear and enforceable. Regulation that provides a feeding frenzy for lawyers and lobbyists is highly problematic and often counterproductive. In contrast to these Liberal Republican views my Democrat friends are much more likely to be suspicious of business and see the government as having a much bigger role in an ideal society such as providing housing and jobs and regulating comprehensively and heavily.  The second issue that separates those of us who are somewhere in the political middle but regard ourselves ideologically as Liberal Republicans rather than as Democrats is what we mean when we advocate for equality. Do we mean equality of opportunity with a strong social safety net (a liberal Republican view) or do we mean relative equality of where we all end up economically (the traditional social democratic view)?  While it is commonplace to say that America is the land of broad opportunity this has been changing in America for a while now. That is a tragedy. The data increasingly demonstrates that we are now doing a poor job as a nation of providing clear paths to upward mobility. This is in part because of things like globalization and technology but also in part because we have had few effective government strategies to promote upward mobility. And one of the reasons we have few effective strategies in addition to our gridlocked government is the muddled mess most of our politicians make of the issue. For example President Obama's 2013 Osawatomie Kansas speech beautifully focused on equality of opportunity rather than equality of results. But the conversation quickly shifted to talking about the one percenters which is much more about equality of result than equality of opportunity. A LOT more Americans will support proactive government policies that are laser focused on equality of opportunity than policies that seek to achieve equality of result. After all part of the American Dream can be summarized in the famous quote ""Socialism never took root in America because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires.""  Over a billion additional people around the world are now living lives that resemble variations of our consumer-oriented middle class society. This is the first time in history many have had the opportunity to affect their and their family's futures so materially relatively unencumbered by a repressive government or by their own beliefs that it is their fate to live the impoverished life they were born to. Billions more aspire to lead such lives and are studying and working very very hard towards such goals. That's a lot of energy out there around the globe with more countries joining this club every decade.  This happy change towards American Dream self-help values around the world is to be celebrated. But it also limits America's policy options in ways that make a Liberal Republican focus on equality of opportunity with a strong safety net much more achievable than the social democratic policies that prevail in much of Western Europe and are supported by many in the Democratic Party today.  Thoughts? Constructive ones much appreciated. Rants and gifs of feces...enough already not just on this Facebook page but in American political life. It may be cathartic but its not helpful.

Having survived an assassination attempt Saba and her family of 12 have recently made the desperate attempt to save their lives by escaping Afghanistan. They have little money and face great uncertainty. They need help from caring and willing people. Please join us.  Read Sabas story here:  Assassination Attempt Colonel Saba Sahar Zaki was the highest-ranking female officer in the Special Forces of Afghans Ministry of Interior when one morning in August 2020 with her 4-year-old daughter driver and bodyguard she was brutally attacked by 3 gunmen. [See Guardian link]. Due to concerns for her security she was taken to the hospital at Bagram Joint Airbase (controlled by the U.S.) where she was treated for 4 gunshots to her stomach. My nephew a U.S. Air Force trauma nurse was part of the team of medical specialists who treated Saba. This is how I came to know Saba her husband Emal and their warm gracious family.  Trailblazer as a Taliban Target Saba has always been a powerful voice and force for womens rights. In the Special Forces Saba recruited and trained other Afghan women for military service becoming their role model and mentor. Saba has never been bashful. Her career began an actress after which she became Afghans first female film director. In an interview by the Guardian in 2012 Saba said passionately I want to show that Afghan women are capable of doing anything men can do. Impressive yes but to the Taliban it meant a death sentence. Saba has been a target for assassination ever since. A few weeks before the family escaped Afghanistan Saba was promoted to the rank of General a long-time dream but only increased the threats.  Move Toward an Uncertain Future as Refugees Threats against Saba and her family did not fade after her attack. In fact after a BBC interview with her was aired in January [see BBC link] the threat level increased. Having resisted the idea of leaving the country she loves she Emal their 5 children and 5 extended family members made the difficult decision to flee Afghanistan for a safer country in March to seek asylum. Saba asked that I not mention the asylum country as even their safety there is not assured. They told me as they finalized their plans We are making the biggest decision of our lives when we leave our homeland and become refugees and move towards an uncertain future.  They are not a wealthy family. I helped them purchase tickets for the flight from Kabul. They are starting their lives with whatever they could carry. They have applied for asylum and temporary refugee status. Life for refugees is quite difficult. Jobs are exceedingly difficult to find housing is limited and poverty is a mainstay. Together with a small group of friends and family I have committed to provide them with a very modest monthly stipend for one year. But that will not be enough.  Their Goal is to Resettle in Canada Now Saba needs our help. I am hoping to raise money for the family through the GoFundMe page I have set up. () Their goal is to resettle in either Canada or the U.S. Although the U.S. may change its stance on refugees the backlog of deserving refugees is daunting. Therefore Saba and Emal are pinning their hopes on resettlement in Canada under its private sponsorship program. As welcoming as Canada is for refugees the best estimate from experts to whom I have spoken is that it will take at least 2 years to apply for the program find sponsors and wade through the process with many other applicants.  Purpose of Fundraising for Saba and her Family If we raise $226000 in donations we will be able to fund the required deposit and legal expenses for the Canadian sponsorship program ($125000). The required deposit (computed by formula for the family of 12) is intended by the Canadian government to cover the cost of the refugees first year. Another $26000 will be needed to supplement the $10000 I have ready raised through family & friends to provide for the familys basic living expenses for up to 2.5 years while they wait in the host/asylum country for their eventual resettlement to Canada. In the meantime Saba will need another surgery to further repair the damage done to her abdomen in the attack. The healthcare system in the host/asylum country is very poor so Saba is hoping the surgery can be done outside the country at an estimated cost of $75000 (including airfare and other travel expenses for one month).  Fundraising summary: Canadian private sponsorship fees: $100000 Legal fees for sponsorship $ 25000 Living Expenses in Asylum: $ 26000 Surgery expenses: $ 75000 Total: $226000  When I first met Saba through my nephew I promised I would assist in any way I could. We need courageous women like Saba who hopes to one day continue her work for the rights of women in Afghanistan. We cannot do the things that Saba has done but we can help her and her family when she needs us. And she needs us now.

Meeting update Nov 2 2021  The biggest discussion was the fence repairs that need to be done. Most of the fence surrounding the levee needs replacing. Immediate repairs are needed near the entrance of Wadsworth Park and the archery range. The fence posts are so rotten they will not hold the staple. The wire also needs replaced. The commissioners agree barbless wire would be better than barbed wire.  Dennis Vroman from Fairfield Custom Fence came to the meeting. He quoted $4732.50 . He needs approval within 30 days to honor that quote. He anticipates prices for supplies to go up. He can fence through Christmas depending on weather and completion of other jobs in progress. He will buy supplies before prices go up and store them until the fence is complete. Fencing has to be done by June 30 2022 as that is when the budget year ends.  Commissioner Chuck Rogers wanted to accept the bid. Commissioner Kelly Manzer wants to get two more bids. One from Northwest Fence and one from Great Falls Fence. Commissioner Scott Lankford agreed. Scott will call both places November 3 to get bids from those two companies within the next 30 days before Fairfield Custom Fences current bid expires.,political,Facebook
SHARE! WAUWATOSA / BROOKFIELD A LETTER FROM CONGRESSMAN JIM SENSENBRENNER Dear Fellow Citizen While I am not asking for your vote I am asking for your help. After I announced last fall my decision not to seek reelection to Congress I envisioned the end of my five decades of public service as a slow walk off into the sunset. However things are often not as we plan. Instead as I approach my final months in Congress I must speak up about matters of grave concern involving Wauwatosa Wisconsin - a community I have represented for almost 20 years where I have worked hard to preserve and improve the quality of life for my constituents. A place where families once flocked in search of quality schools and neighborhoods there is now unchecked lawlessness. Bullies have infiltrated - calling to defund the police - and have turned safe streets into mobs of intimidation carrying agendas with demands that can never be met. And perhaps most troubling there is violence against officers and good cops cant effectively do their jobs. My years of work on the House Judiciary Committee have given me insight about issues of security. I have seen firsthand what works and doesnt work and Ive always told it like it is. I believe the time is now for leaders in Wauwatosa to show strength and resolve - to stand up to the bullies and to protect the families and businesses that once thrived. The liberals in this unsettled community try to appease and play nice and sing kumbaya. It isnt working. I have heard from many of Tosas citizens who are frightened to go shopping afraid to go to restaurants and afraid to be Wauwatosans. Whether its Kenosha Milwaukee Madison or now Wauwatosa its sure to be other communities soon and it must stop. As voters we must reward leadership. We must demand Tosa and other elected officials take a stand and step up to make the hard decisions to keep us safe. And we must vote out those who are not up to the job. I could sit back and count the days until January 3 2021 when I will be out of Congress but this is just too important. I hope you will join me in this crusade in supporting candidates in Wauwatosa who will not shy away from the bullies who will put the needs of our families and businesses first will support law enforcement and will restore the quality of life we have worked so hard to build. Sincerely Jim,political,Facebook
Hello everyone !

Why am I running? It is my belief that our elected officials in El Paso TX rarely if ever are held accountable for their decisions. They make decisions and essentially act like many of our parents would when we were younger. Its whats best for you because we said so. Problem is they are not our parents. Its quite simple these roles should be reversed. When decisions are made they should feel obligated to explain who what when where why how. Instead they distract with half truths and act as though we should be grateful. Heres a recent example. Just recently County Judge Samaniego and his Commissioners Court boasted proudly about how in the best interest of the people they were not gonna give themselves raises (very nobel of them) and they will not raise property taxes both because El Pasoans are struggling due to the pandemic. These are good decisions. But WHAT IS THE TRUTH? The truth is that even contemplating giving themselves a raise is absurd. As it is they already make at least double the average income of El Paso residents. Thats just on average. About 30% make $30000 or less. Almost 40% make $60000 or more (and by more I mean 18% is AT LEAST $100000). But they did us a favor. But they cut property taxes because of the struggling residents of El Paso County. Sounds good and it is. But WHATS THE TRUTH? Since this county administration was elected less than 4 years ago the tax rate has gone up. Now when a state has no state tax yeah taxes will be higher. They inherited a tax at approx .44. The next year (2020) they jumped it up to .48. Now in 2021 they do everyone the favor of not raising the tax. I may be mistaken but from the info I can find property values are looking to go up as well. So how much are people actually saving? If Im wrong Im open to being educated. But I dont believe Im the only one who sees this and feels this way. Which is part of the problem. They should feel obligated to explain these things in detail to their constituents. Thats not the case though. They pat themselves on the back publicly about doing us a favor. First off not much of a favor. Secondly even if it was/is its their job. No credit for doing what your supposed to do. Especially when its the bare minimum at best. Again if Im misguided or wrong in my research bring it to my attention and I will own it. The income they are acquiring is being poorly mismanaged. Part of the commissioners jobs are supposed to be taking care of infrastructure roads buildings. Ill stick with roads. How many projects do we have going on all over town? At the same time? They make decisions and then immediately have to change it because it was not planned out properly. I can think of multiple areas that have been terrible for multiples of years. Railroad the neighborhood streets between Hondo Pass and Hercules Doniphan and countless others. Having to build additions to the freeway after just adding to the freeways because they are reactive and not proactive. How long is trans mountain gonna continue to be a single lane? I know the rain and flooding really put a strain on much of these road problems. Im sure that was a problem that they were supposed to have at least partially fixed. I guess they didnt expect a 50 year storm 14 years after the last 50 year storm. What happened to 14 years of taxes and water works hikes? Reactive not proactive. But absolutely unacceptable. I know it doesnt all fall in this current administration but its a problem that seems to be happening no matter who is sitting in those seats. Thats one of many reasons we need to change their comfort and processes. But why fix our problems here at home. Keep spending the money fighting the state over and over and over. Much more proactive. -Adam Fatuch,political,Facebook
MODERN MONETARY THEORY: MISREPRESENTED ONCE AGAIN  Recently on a Bloomberg financial podcast a senior executive at J.P. Morgan stated he did not believe in Modern Monetary Theory (MMT). MMT is a controversial monetary theory which offers a description of monetary operations which challenge orthodox economic and financial thinking. Within current MMT reasoning there is a belief there is room for fiscal expansion which when coordinated with the Nation's central bank--the Federal Reserve (FED) will enable public investment in human and physical capital i.e. infrastructure without inflationary consequences. The J.P. Morgan executive argued that in order for MMT to succeed that it would also have to fail: that to accumulate the debt which he implies is acceptable to MMT for public investment then even if the investment proved good for the economy the accumulated debt would then tank the economy.  It was the strangest comment that one could expect from an investment banker and it also misrepresented MMT views. First from an investment banker perspective it is strange to state that debt issuance condemns an institution to failure. Bankers afterall are peddlers of private sector debt issued on the belief that the gains from private investment will generally exceed the cost of capital. Government debt issued in order to facilitate productive investment: physical and human likewise has the potential to create long term gains in the economy which exceed the cost of capital. So it was strange to hear an investment banker ignore the growth potential associated with public debt issuance which finances physical and human capital investment: the type of investment promoted within the MMT framework.  The MMT public sector investment portfolio would include such things as green energy investment in education and most importantly a federal job guarantee program which would offer a job to anyone who seeks a job at a livable wage with health and child care benefits--a near full employment program.  A legitimate concern here should not be the level of debt so long as the associated funds are directed into productive investment but the concern should be the potential inflationary impact of large scale investment which creates individual earnings not yet matched by an increase in the provision of consumer goods and services. The temporary mismatch between increased earnings from new investment and the availability of goods and services may create short to medium term inflationary pressures in these consumer markets. One market concern undoubtedly is the belief that once inflation begins it feeds on itself into an upward spiral of increased inflationary pressure which can only be resolved through monetary and fiscal tightenings i.e. an induced recession.  It is not clear to me whether MMT has adequately addressed the short term inflationary impact of broad public infrastructure investment. MMT definitely recognizes that Federal spending is limited by potential inflationary effects of Federal spending and it seems they differ from the broader market participants in their view of the size and scope of available resources which can be put to work before real resource restraints create inflationary pressure. In other words it seems that MMT believes there currently exists greater slack in the economy than the broader market participants believe and it also seems that MMT believes that increased productive capacity which meets consumer demand can come online rather quickly in order to thwart these inflationary pressures. The latter view is undoubtedly challenged in a trade restricted environment.  It appears that MMT takes the long view and the bigger point is that green energy will eventually be a more efficient source of energy while high tech education combined with liberal arts training will make us both more productive and better citizens. The federal jobs programs will assist in the development of work skills which will further enhance national productivity. Debt used to finance such activity would be a very good use of debt and will not inflict damage on the national economy but rather will enhance long term growth in a noninflationary manner.  Much of the above discussion is premised on a misrepresentation of the MMT view on public debt. The J.P. Morgan Executive's view is premised on the idea that Federal deficit spending must be funded with debt. This is not the MMT view. Federal debt issuance is a policy option not a requirement for deficit spending.  The MMT view is that a sovereign monetary authority such as the U.S. which creates its own free floating currency creates money when it spends and destroys money through taxation and borrowing. Money creation and money destruction need not be equal. Spending need not be fully funded but only 'funded' to an extent and in a manner which prevents inflation in the goods services and asset markets. In other words deficit spending need not be funded with debt: the money for deficit spending is created through the act of spending. An equivalent debt issuance merely destroys an equal amount of money thereby neutralizing any inflationary impact of the deficit spending. Debt issuance i.e. money destruction is a mere tool for inflation control and for other convenient purposes i.e. private portfolio investment stability store of value interest rate targeting . . . .  Furthermore the Executive's narrative ignored debt management techniques discussed previously on this Page such as debt extinguishment the Platinum coin idea which grew out of the 2011 budget ceiling crisis taxation of the well-off rather than borrowing from the well-off and Federal Reserve perpetual holdings of Treasury debt on its balance sheet--which is costless to the U.S. taxpayer. The Executive's brief discussion of MMT was yet another false representation of MMT views.  Generally it is wise to dismiss about 85% of corporate reporting on MMT. Most commentators have not seriously examined MMT; others are in no mood to change the status quo. Large capital interests in the private sector simply do not want to concede additional space to the public sector regardless of the long term growth potential associated with public sector investment.  Undoubtedly the Nation's long term productivity potential would be greatly enhanced by the above public sector investments. But in the long run the current investment class won't be here. Perhaps this is part of the problem. The other part of the problem lies in the short term investment horizon of private sector firms a response to investor demands for short term profits which do not align with the long term investment objectives of the Federal government.,political,Facebook
"SOCIALISM CHRISTIANITY AND LOW WAGE EMPLOYMENT  I generally try to minimize mixing politics with religion because it is a dangerous path as evidenced by the Christian fundamentalist capture of the Republican Party. My Christian upbringing and subsequent Christian practice however have formed my socialist beliefs. While today I subscribe to no religious dogma and certainly have equal respect for other religious beliefs New Testament teaching will always form the foundation of my beliefs. So despite my own ""do not judge your brother"" Christian background a theme prevalent in New Testament teaching allow me to indulge for a moment in human frailty.  This past week I was very upset by some reporting on a financial podcast which I like to visit. Two different guests within a 30 minute podcast complained that businesses were having a hard time hiring help mostly in low wage industries as the workers were being paid too much to stay at home. The implication being that the average unemployment benefit of roughly $620 weekly enabled workers to forsake life risking low wage employment--which it does.  One of the interviewees: nice enough guy was from Myrtle Beach Florida. His complaint was that restaurants and motels which dominate this resort community could not find sufficient help to meet the demand of visiting resort-goers. The class arrogance of this statement gave me one of those ""ugh"" capitalism moments.  Most people are not born on a plot of land which grants them title to a lifetime of sustenance. They are dependent on a system which dictates poverty and low wages at one end of the system so those on the other end of the system may prosper. Now we find ourselves in the midst of a global health pandemic and it is not enough that some peoples' lives are banished to hardship and despair but now they are also expected to risk their lives and the lives of family and others in order for others to enjoy a game of gulf indulgent meals and luxurious motels.  None of this should surprise us as the whole capitalist order is built on the idea that one person's material extravagance is more important than another's material needs. But this particular story laid bare the corrupt foundation of the capitalist order.  There is no effort here to question the moral basis of those who engage in this unneeded consumption. It is likely that most of the participants actually believe they are doing a good thing: providing jobs and so forth. But we can certainly question the capitalist ideology which justifies this behavior. I can not square this behavior with my version of Christianity--which condemns materialism and promotes care for others. I have never thought of myself as a textualist in the legal setting but apparently when it comes to Christian scripture I am a textualist. The plain language of New Testament scripture is quite clear. We are to love one another provide for those in need and presumably this would include not putting peoples' lives at risk for 9 or 10 bucks an hour for luxurious nonessential consumption.  Human decency alone would seem to dictate such a conclusion.",political,Facebook

"Another day another set of outright lies told by someone who would rather make things up than campaign honestly on the issues. Today Tracy Pappas - another candidate for BPW - joins Calhoun and Ortolano in her write up in the Nashua Telegraph focusing on their fabricated ""conflict of interest"" and calling my work managing a staff of 5 and a dozen community events and programs throughout the year ""part time"".  Pappas wrote. ""Mr. Shea serves as the executive director for Great American Downtown (GAD). Its a part-time job that pays more than $50000 per year. This organization receives a lot of money from the city and likely wouldnt survive without city money. The mayor serves as the chairman of the BPW. Its unlikely that Mr. Shea would disagree with the mayor when a good portion of his livelihood is dependent on city money. This is a clear conflict of interest.""  I've addressed these same lies before on several occaisions and yet Pappas finds the need to repeat them. She must be relying on the old addage: ""If you repeat a lie enough times eventually it is accepted as true."" Personally I can't wait until November 3rd - so perhaps we can be done with people lieing about my employer and the work I do for their own perceived political gain.  Do these three even have jobs? They seem to have a lot of free time to dedicate to writing bad fiction about mine.",political,Facebook
IF TEACHERS ARE PUSHED TO THE FRONT OF THE VACINE LINE REOPENING OF ALL SCHOOLS INCLUDING HIGH SCHOOLS MUST GE GUARANTEED.  Still no agreement with the Chicago Teachers Union on reopening schools. Lets see while the Chicago Teachers Union tells its members not to go to school essential workers in much riskier jobs like doctors nurses police officers firefighters EMTs bus drivers and others REFUSE to stay at home. The failure to open public schools because of teacher union intransigence imposes and even greater hardship on essential workers with public school children. Despite the fact that with the exception of a limited number of pre-school and select special education teachers CTU members have not provided in-person instruction for eleven months they are demanding that they be considered essential workers and be moved to the head of the vaccination line. This should not be done without a guarantee that they will return to work once vaccinated and that the reopening of high schools be part of the reopening plan. To date there are no plans or even negotiations on the reopening of the high schools despite the dramatic increase in violence committed against and by school age children. With the parochial schools having been open since August their teachers and staff should be given at the very least the same priority status as the public school teachers who have not been in the classroom since last March.,political,Facebook

My campaign has just submitted my completed questionnaire to the Chicago Sun-Times. Im sharing my responses below:  Thomas J Wilda Running for the 5th Congressional District seat in Illinois Green Party Social Worker PhD Facebook/Twitter/Instagram: @TomWilda2020 1 . Are you satisfied with the federal governments response to the COVID-19 pandemic? Why or why not? What grade would you give President Donald Trump for his handling of the pandemic and why? This pandemic was not taken seriously from the beginning. The failed response began before the pandemic hit with the reduction and near elimination of the CDC staff. Lack of equipment can be blamed on poor management and years of depending on labor camps in China to produce the equipment. President Trump failed to enact the Production Defense Act failed to abide by CDC guidelines failed to give help to the states in following CDC guidelines. We are left with the worse response to his crisis in the world the most cases the most deaths. Our country gets an F for our response. 2. What should the federal government do to stimulate economic recovery from the pandemic shutdowns? There is an immediate need for a UBI (Universal Basic Income) for every adult citizen in the country. $3000 a month is needed. For those that do not need it it can be taxed back. People need to pay rents and mortgages. Businesses that were doing well before the pandemic need to have payroll and expense support so that they will be viable after the pandemic. Medicare for all must be enacted to ensure medical coverage for citizens and payments to hospitals medical facilities and doctors. 3. In the wake of the death of George Floyd President Trump signed an executive order on police reform. It calls for the creation of a database to track police officers with multiple instances of misconduct federal grants to encourage police departments to meet higher certification standards on use of force and the greater involvement of social workers and mental health professionals when the police respond to calls dealing with homelessness mental illness and addiction. The order also calls for police departments to ban the use of chokeholds except when an officer feels his or her life is endangered. Will this be enough to address concerns about police brutality? If not what other steps should be taken? These reforms are not enough. President Trump (and it occurred with President Obama also) proudly gave assault military equipment to police departments. Police departments have developed a culture of military presence with a siege mentality. This process has been many years in the making. Police departments should be defunded and then refunded. Police officers can reapply for their position. All new police officers will be required to train in non-violent processes. Military equipment must be returned to the federal government. Police officers must be licensed with a requirement of continuing education in order to maintain their license. Civilian police boards must be enacted with the power to review suspend and terminate officers. 4. Also in the wake of the death of George Floyd the House passed the Justice in Policing Act which would ban police departments from using chokeholds develop a national standard for use of force limit the transfer of military weapons to police departments define lynching as a federal hate crime establish a national police misconduct registry and limit qualified immunity which protects officers from lawsuits over alleged misconduct. Do you support this legislation? Why or why not? What other steps if any would you like to see the federal government take on police reform? I do support this legislation. Please see my prior response for what other steps are needed for reform. 5. Whats your view on President Trumps decision to commute the sentence of Roger Stone? There are many people in prison for long sentences for possessing a very small amount of marijuana. It is not right that those that commit white collar crimes are treated better than other citizens. The president needs to commute the sentences of many people who have committed small crimes. 6. Please tell us about your civic work in the last two years whether its legislation you have sponsored or other paid or volunteer work to improve your community. The last years I have had a private practice in psychotherapy. Many of my clients have an inability to pay due to immigration status and other reasons. I have treated a good number of people pro bono. In past years I have worked with the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless; helped establish a homeless center and worked with various community groups. I am also a founding member of the Alliance for Just Money. 7. What are your views on the decision by the U.S. House to impeach President Donald Trump? Was the impeachment process fair or not? How so? If in your view the president should not have been impeached would you have supported censure? Please explain. The Democrats attempted to impeach the President on false premises. Evidence used was not genuine. The Steele dossier was a made-up document. The process was an attempt to avoid addressing the flaws in the Democratic platform as well as the support of a flawed candidate in a corrupt primary process. There are many things the President may be criminally liable for but these were not investigated. I think mostly because many politicians of both major parties are guilty of similar offenses. The process of impeachment was a sham and removed our attention from the wars we are in the out of control military budget the climate crisis and much more. 8. How would you reduce the federal budget deficit which now stands at about $1 trillion for 2020? What changes if any to the U.S. tax code do you support and why?  Firstly the budget deficit this year will be $3-4 trillion. It is this deficit that is often used as the reason we cannot have good things like Medicare for All forgiveness of student debt and free education. The deficit exists because the country relies on private banks purchasing Treasury Bonds for its money supply. There are few banks that are qualified to do this so the process is in the hands of a small number of people. In buying Treasury Bonds banks fund the government. They buy the bonds with money made from thin air but expect the money to be repaid with interest. So we have debt. When the government cannot cover its costs through taxation they sell more bonds. This process was established by The Federal Reserve system in 1913. All banks must be part of it. As part of this act private banks can create money from nothing for other purposes such as mortgages and student loans. Banks create money only through the establishment of debt. This debt under the current system can never be paid back. It does not have to be this way. Article 1 section 8 clause 5 of the US Constitution gives the federal government the right to create money without debt. My proposal would be to eliminate the Federal Reserve and the right of banks to create money with debt and create a monetary authority under the Department of the Treasury. The authority would determine the amount of money needed in the economy to provide for the common welfare and common needs. The Treasury would establish this amount and it would be budgeted by Congress. This would be clean money without debt. What about the debt that exists? It would be paid back to the banks by the Treasury over a period of years. Probably around 100. Banks would have money for their reserves and to lend for new investments and business ventures Regarding the tax code: All should be paying their fair share. The wealthiest have the first access to created money the average citizen has the last access. The last pay the most and the first pay the least. We need to change that so that the first are last and the last are first. That would be a fair tax system. 9. What changes would you like to see made to our nations healthcare system? Would you shore up the Affordable Care Act or work to repeal it in full? Whats your view on Medicare for All? And what should be done if anything to bring down the cost of prescription drugs? This is so easy. Medicare at 100% for all is the least expensive and most fair way to fund a healthcare system. Look at the rest of the developed world. The government through Medicare for all would be able to negotiate the price of drugs but medications would be paid for by a Medicare for all program. 10. Do you support or oppose DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) and why? Should a path to citizenship be created for the so-called DREAMers? Please explain. This is just simple justice. Those who came here as children and have grown up here and contribute to society have a right to stay. Anything else would be inhuman. Of course they should be able to become citizens. 11. What are the three most important issues in your district on which the federal government can and should act? In terms of the Federal Government for this district and many districts UBI with fair tax system is needed Medicare for all and a just distribution of federal dollars for human needs in the district. 12.  What is the biggest difference between you and your opponent(s)? I really dont know where my Republican opponent stands on these issues. As far as my Democratic opponent and the incumbent well I would say look at his voting record. 13. What action should Congress take if any to reduce gun violence? Military grade weaponry needs to be illegal. Other guns must be registered and owning a gun most be licensed with a requirement of yearly continuing education on gun safety. Police should be as focused on illegal gun sales as they are on drug sales. 14. Is climate change real? Is it significantly man-made? Is it a threat to humankind? What if anything should Congress and the federal government do about it? The knowledge that burning fossil fuels creates climate change was researched and confirmed by the oil companies themselves in the 1950s 70 years ago. It is not a debate in the scientific community; only the business community wants there to be a debate. We already see the effects of climate change and it will get worse. What is needed is a Green New Deal. We need to get off fossil fuels reduce consumption of energy and create jobs to protect water forests and animals our ecosystem both micro and macro. 15. What should Congress do to ensure the solvency of Social Security and Medicare? During the Reagan administration the Social Security fund was used to balance the budget. This money was taken from Social Security to make an economic policy appear better. There have been raids on Social Security ever since. There is no crisis of Social Security. Social Security is not part of the budget so cutting it would not make a difference in the deficit. The effort to reduce Social Security is totally inhumane. Social Security will be solvent if the money owed to it is paid. I am for Medicare for all. 16. What should Congress do to address the student loan crisis? Would you use the word crisis? Student debt is a crisis. It puts many from the younger generations in the position of being indentured servants. They are not able to participate fully in the economy because so much of their income goes to debt payment. Student loans should be assumed by the Federal Government and added to the deficit that will be paid overtime when we have a just clean money system. Yes this is a crisis for those who are burdened with this debt but this is also a crisis for the economy as money that pays back debt is not money that goes into the development of the economy. 17. What should our nations relationship be with Russia? We should have fair and just relationships with all nations. We should not have a belligerent oppositional relationship with any country. It is not in the interests of the American people to have such relationships only the interests of the military industrial complex. 18. Whats your view on the use of tariffs in international commerce? Has President Trump imposed tariffs properly and effectively? Please explain. President Trump uses tariffs as punishments. The industrialists have been sending jobs to places without worker protection and in the case of China to foreign labor camps for awhile. Once there is a truly fair workplace in every country there would be little need for tariff protection. We should be ensuring that workers are treated fairly both here and everywhere else and that ecological protections are in place everywhere. Once we have accomplished this tariffs will take care of themselves. 19. Does the United States have a responsibility to promote democracy in other countries? Please explain. We need to have democracy in the United States first. We know that our intelligence agencies have been undermining democracy in the rest of the world. This is not in service of the American people but in the interests of big business. We should not send military anywhere with the excuse that we are doing it to protect democracy. We are in other countries to secure wealth for the richest. 20. What should Congress do to limit the proliferation of nuclear arms? Demand that the President negotiate a nuclear arms reduction treaty with all nuclear powers with the end goal of eliminating all nuclear arms. 21. Please list all relatives on public or campaign payrolls and their jobs on those payrolls. None 22. What historical figure from Illinois other than Abraham Lincoln (because everybodys big on Abe) do you most admire or draw inspiration from? Please explain. I was inspired by Paul Simons moral and principled stances on issues. 23. Whats your favorite TV streaming or web-based show of all time. Why? I do not watch much TV but 20 years ago my wife and I liked the X Files. The portrayal of the intersection of science and intuition was interesting.,political,Facebook
Annette Glenn needs to apologize to every law enforcement officer and Black person in our community.  She and her friends chose to knowingly tell lies about me in TV ads to score political points while USING the police and Black citizens as pawns.  She doesn't care if police officers saw these lies and thought I wanted to take their jobs. She doesn't care if Black people saw these lies and felt portrayed (yet again) as dangerous and unwelcome in our community.  What matters to her and her friends is staying in power - no matter the cost and regardless of what is true.  This is shameful.  She owes them all an apology for using them.  And because I know she won't I'll say it. I'm sorry that dirty politics is creating this environment that is shutting down the conversations and the voices needed to find real solutions.

Dare 2B Daring  April 6 2021 A daily devotional published by Risk Takers for Christ Inc. (Permission granted to reprint with proper attribution.)  There is no limit to the human capacity for self-rationalization.  Chuck Colson  Charles Wendell Chuck Colson was known as President Richard Nixons hatchet man. In other words he was assigned the dirty  and sometimes illegal  jobs that others in the White House wouldnt touch or couldnt be trusted to do quietly and efficiently.  Despite having an Ivy League education (Brown University 1953) and a law degree from the prestigious George Washington University Law School (1959) Colson apparently had no qualms about bending (and breaking) the law in the presidents service. In true Machiavellian fashion Colson seemed to believe that the end justified the means.  Colsons ability to compartmentalize made him the perfect man to leak information from Daniel Ellsbergs FBI file some of it gathered illegally from his psychiatrists office. Ellsberg who vigorously opposed the Vietnam War and had released the damaging Pentagon Papers was fair game as far as Colson was concerned. However Watergate special prosecutor Leon Jaworski disagreed and a grand jury indicted Colson for conspiracy to cover up the Watergate burglaries.  Before his trial Colson was given a copy of C.S. Lewis Mere Christianity which resulted in his religious conversion. Newly born again Colsons conscience would not allow him to escape punishment and so he pled guilty to obstruction of justice. Judge Gerhard Gesell sentenced Colson to 1-to-3 years in prison and fined him $5000. He was also barred from practicing law in the District of Columbia.  Today most Americans know more about Colsons post-Watergate life than the seven months he spent at the Maxwell Correctional Facility in Alabama. Within a year of his release Colson founded Prison Fellowship which according to Wikipedia is the worlds largest Christian nonprofit organization for prisoners former prisoners and their families and a leading advocate for justice reform.  The moral of Colsons story is this: people will do virtually anything to further their own selfish interests and ambitions. Likewise they will also do almost anything to cover up their misdeeds.  However when a person repents of their sins and comes to saving faith in Jesus Christ the Holy Spirit immediately indwells that new believer. One of His jobs is to shed light in the darkest of places which often results in our coming clean and fessing up.  Bye-bye self-rationalization!  If we confess our sins He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. I John 1:9 (NKJV)  - Rev. Dale M. Glading President,political,Facebook
We agree. Vote NO until there's a plan  From a supporter:  I'm curious if the people that are pro-consolidation would run their businesses the same way? Would they enter into a merger with another company with no plan? Would they fire half their staff and tell them they can reapply for their jobs that will have twice the amount of work for around the same pay? Would they tell their staff that has been with them for a long time they may not get a pay raise and it has nothing to do with their performance? Would they enter into a merger without a lifelong partner that is going to come for an unknown amount of assets they helped pay for? Would they enter into a merger based on incomplete numbers and speculation? I doubt it. Consolidation without a plan is not helping any kids it only creates a big mess for someone else to deal with. Vote No until they get a plan.,political,Facebook

"A lot to write about tonight. Mostly about the rec facility public hearing but some other substantive topics as well:  * We had an assortment of minor development changes - some rezoning in the country for rural housing fixing some mistakes in a previous development regarding lot setbacks splitting out a new lot in town so an additional dwelling could be built etc.  * The airport continues to smash records -- at a pace of more than 36000 passengers a year -- and we are moving quickly to build more parking. 77 new spaces are almost done and with the contractor already in place we negotiated a great deal to add another 22 right away. City council members suffer through this growth as well. I nearly had to park on Airport Rd the last time I was there.  * Archway had record revenues in April and May this year.  * Compute North the company with a data center at the tech park generated over $100k in revenues for the city from its operations this last month. Its small footprint and relatively light strain on our job market is yielding great things for our city. We are very appreciative of them and for NPPD on making this development possible.  * Finally we held a public hearing about the idea of building a new city sports complex. The question to consider boiled down was to allow voters to decide on Dec 14 whether to continue the expiring 1% restaurant tax to pay for a portion of this facility.  If you want to read the packet we had for the discussion which includes a couple pages of bullet points at the end click here:  I will skip to the punchline to say that the council voted 4-0 (with one member absent) to give City of Kearney voters the question of deciding whether to build this facility and continue the restaurant tax to pay for a portion of it. The election will be December 14.  Here are the important details:  * Uses of the facility are somewhat fluid which we discussed in the meeting but generally speaking we are looking at: 1) a 70k square ft indoor turf field ostensibly for soccer or for really for anything you can image; 2) As many as 8 basketball courts which convert to 12 volleyball courts; 3) 4 pickleball courts; 4) an elevated running/walking track with curves that allow for fast running/sprints and are within regulation for indoor tracks although it couldn't be used for official college track meets  * It would be over 200k square feet total and we are capping costs for the public question at $34 million  * It would be built on Talmadge St west of the new convention center (location is critical for state funding)  * Its intent would be as a premier destination for adult and youth sporting competitions which are already a major economic development driver for Kearney. It is hard to see unless you are down in the hotel areas on a weekend but adult and youth travel sports are creating a ton of Kearney jobs and paying for a lot of our taxes.  * It would also be accessible to the general public for park & recreation activities and other uses/drop-ins.  Why is this a good idea?  * I cannot overstate the fact that tourism is critical to the quality of life we have here. More and more things are going east and if we aren't leading and growing we are shrinking and losing. We must maintain our edge in this critical are of our economy.  * We have very very tight usage now for the various gym facilities around the community. Lots of late nights and challenging time slots for individuals kids and teams to work around school schedules to get on school gymnasiums some of which are undersized.  * We have a literal once in a generation opportunity to pay to build this facility - The state has a law that allows any new economic development within 600 yards of a sports complex like this to contribute all sales taxes towards the building cost... up to 50% of the cost. These sales taxes would otherwise just go to Lincoln to the state general fund. There may be no other time that a facility like this could be stationed next to an economic driver like the new convention center in order to yield such a significant amount of money. - The restaurant tax is expiring from paying off Patriot Park. Out of town residents pay approximately half of that we think. We can continue that 1% tax to cover the other half of the costs leaving Kearney taxpayers basically covering 1/4 of the cost a building like this. - With recreation space already tight in Kearney there is a real scenario where the city would need to develop some new gym space anyway. For the same amount of local tax money we can build something that gets the job done or we can leverage the state and tourism dollars and build something that will make Kearney a state regional and national destination -- and that isn't hyperbole. There are already several national sports associations communicating with Kearney about coming with national tournaments if this is built.  * However governments often talk about building something but don't confront the need to operate it. That is where hidden costs are and taxpayers are left footing the bill for years to come. Again we have once in a generation scenario to address this: - The Kearney Visitors Bureau just ended its subsidy of the Class Car Museum -- this was approximately $300000 a year. As a member of that board I felt that while the car museum was an amazing facility the ROI on that amount of funds wasn't there. Now the visitors bureau can take those funds which are generated by hotel stays and cover a portion of the operating costs for a facility that will bring 10s of thousands of people to Kearney each year. - A private donor has agreed to give $50000 a year towards operations. - Projected revenues from sports events are over half a million dollars ever year and close the gap on operating costs leaving no need to increase taxes on any local residents to operate it. - Admittedly this is where there is some uncertainty but I have quizzed staff visitors bureau and sports associations in Kearney repeatedly about these projections and most feel that the revenue projections are actually conservative.  * So what else is happening that makes this a good project? - Thanks to federal CARES money Talmadge street was already in the process of being paved all the way to Yanney Park giving two clean entrances to the facility. - Thanks to the car museum sale the visitors bureau is also giving $1 million to an endowment that will grow to cover upgrades and maintenance for the facility. - Younes Hospitality has agreed to provide exterior maintenance for the facility at no charge. - The land for the site will be donated  Based on the conservative projections no new taxes or costs for City of Kearney residents will have to be levied to build the largest indoor sports complex like this from what I understand in the State of Nebraska. Let that sink in.  One other thing that is driving me relates to casinos. A recent newspaper article had Fonner Park in Grand Island complaining about all the casino plans in motion in Nebraska. Communities throughout our state are considering building casinos -- I can think of eight off the top of my head. Some people think casinos are the way to drive economic development for Nebraska. I'm not against people choosing to frequent them but I think the impact will be diluted and I would rather we drive economic development in a different way in Kearney. However if we can't do something on this scale in a sports facility I truly believe there will be a serious push to put a casino in Kearney too. Whether that is good or bad is a personal opinion but a center for adult and youth sports is the kind of statement I think we should make.  Lastly in addition to the public meeting I did hear from a number of people the last two weeks. The vast majority were positive. However every project like this has good questions and concerns that come up and I thought I would list some of the things I'm hearing from people -- not all these questions came from people who are straight up against the project but are just unsure right now and that is fair.  * Restaurant tax - I'll paraphrase comments - ""I thought that was supposed to expire. You told us that it would go away but I knew that it wouldn't."" -- I do understand the cynicism about taxes and there is no doubt that City of Kearney residents could choose to stop the tax (about $1.1m collected per year about half comes from local residents). However the tax IS ending just like we said and it will only continue if residents choose to do that. The council can only put it on the ballot. I think based on the return on investment it is wise for us to continue it but I only get one vote out of thousands in making that decision. To be clear just because a tax gets 51% doesn't make the tax by nature a good tax. My main check as a council member is whether the tax to be voted on by the people has a clear use has a clear completion date and doesn't lead to other future hidden costs. This tax meets all those things for me and so I think it is justifiable for citizens to vote whether to continue it.  * ""We need to spend money on different things like roads"" -- I 110% agree about building roads. We are literally building roads as fast as we can. We cannot physically build anymore due to # of contractors. Also this money is not fungible. Every facet of the funds to be used would be for this project/tourism/etc. We aren't depriving our budget of anything else that a city needs to be doing. If it isn't spent on this it either will just go to the state or will go towards other tourism projects.  * ""What about other uses for the facility?"" - again good question. There are other potential sports uses -- skateboarding competitions swimming ice hockey to name a few. The plans are somewhat fluid but also each of those uses would be a significant cost increase. I think the best thing was said but Randy Buschkoetter tonight. This project lays the groundwork for other things to be added more cheaply and easily in the future should people decide to do that. Can only do so much now with the budget we can afford even as high as it is. But this is a step closer to any one of those things.  * ""Not a good city purpose / should be private"" -- Also a good point and generally I would agree for large venues. The city does need more indoor facilities for recreation which we could do more cheaply and fill the basic need. However we probably couldn't fill those basic needs any more cheaply than what city taxpayers would have to pay for this great facility. In addition the incentives and the way the state set up their sales tax turnback program this is really only happening with the city doing it or else it's not happening.  * ""You say that the public will have access but we've heard that before."" -- This one stings a little because it is about trust. All I can say is to turn your eyes on the track record of the City of Kearney. Whether it is spreading splash pads throughout the community giving many user groups access to Patriot Park including the schools creating the Kearney Community Olympics etc. etc. the city has a track record in recreation of not just catering to traveling teams and elite sports but keeping the average citizen in mind. This will be a facility used for competitive sports and tournaments no doubt and there may be weekends where it is tough for the general public to access all of it but we are committed to giving public access and expect citizens to hold us accountable for that promise.  Ultimately this is in the hands of citizens now. Citizens brought the idea forward and the council thought it was wise to open the question to the city at large. But if it passes it won't be because any of the five council members lobbied for it. It will be because community groups speak to their friends family and neighbors.",political,Facebook
"A prepared statement by the candidate:  Good Morning my Fellow Minnesotans  Today I would like to speak on small businesses Unions and political campaigns of today's day and age.  Unions are a vital part of this country and the community. Talk to every proud union member they will tell you what the union does for them. Unions ensure that companies treat their employees fairly that the employees are fairly compensated they provide resources to employees and their families when needed and they ensure that employees laid off must be re-employed by the company. Unions stimulate economy by ensuring fair wages and this also helps keep employees from relying on government programs. Unions have gotten a bad reputation we have all heard at least one story where someone was protected by their union when they should have been fired or that they breed laziness. All I can say is that without the Union 9/11 would have worse on my family. My Mom was a union member this may make me a bit bias because I grew up knowing her union friends. On September 24th 2001 without warning My Mom went to work at NWA and was told she was no longer employed with the company; she was being laid off. This didn't just happened to her 2500 employees of Northwest Airlines' Minnesota operation were given the same news. The office's department boss on September 11th 2001 told everyone present that nobody was going to be laid off. Speaking for the company her department boss stated that the company was confident that 9/11 while tragic was not going to hurt any of the office employees. On the 24th it was exposed to be the lie that it was. My Mom's tenacity landed her in front of the late Senator Ted Kennedy who was the chairman of the HELP committee. My Brother was diagnosed with cancer at the age of 4 years old and was a patient at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis Tennessee. With my Brother and I's pre-existing health conditions as well as Mom's insurance financially impossible. Thankfully we lived with my Grandparents and they helped shoulder some of the burden while Mom gave my Brother and I a voice in congress. The Union helped Mom get her job back with insurance that covered all of us. Anybody who has been out of work knows how expensive COBRA is and knows the financial impossibility of being able to afford it. Without my Grandparents and the Union my Brother and I would have been placed in foster care because my Mom through no fault of her own found herself unemployed due to a terrorist attack. Unions may get a bad reputation but in circumstances like 9/11 they are without question very valuable. One final example of how unions are vital to stimulating our economy is NWA's AMFA contract. An employee who stayed a cleaner for 5 years back in 1999 would have received a little over $18 an hour this is in contrast to the national average of $14.02 reported in 2000. These figures come from page 401 of the 2008 edition of the US Commerce's Statistical Abstract of the United States.  Like Unions small businesses are vital to our local economies. Small businesses employ local workers and often times have more understanding and compassion for their employees' unique circumstances. These business get taxed astronomically and in some cases the taxation causes them to shut down in the lean years. My Grandparents owned a business from 1974 until 1992. The business was started as a blacksmith in 1892 by my 2x great grandfather Michael J. Corcoran who later moved the business into downtown Rosemount in 1916. The business would pass hands twice until it reached my grandparents Dick and Pody Corcoran. Employing 10-15 residents of the community they were one of many businesses that were responsible for employing roughly 90% of Rosemount's residents. A string of bad city council decisions from roughly 1980 into the 90's saw many of Rosemount's small business quietly close their doors seemingly overnight. The decisions made by the City Council hurt the small ""Mom and Pop"" businesses and practically ensured their inability to thrive. My Grandparent's weathered these decisions despite having the cards stacked against them from the start. Many of the businesses were offered to move by other cities who saw the value they would provide their communities. Some of these businesses could afford to move while others would have the money to move only after selling both their inventory and the building they owned. My Grandparents along with a couple other family businesses decided to stay despite the offers they had received. Each business that stayed had a myriad of reasons for doing so. My Grandparents in part stayed because they felt they were a valued business; a feeling that the city council took every opportunity not to reciprocate despite the feelings of Rosemount's citizens. In '92 as a final act of hostility the city council denied my Grandparents the right to gift to the Catholic Church the land they owned where the original store had stood. The city council deemed the land to be too valuable and would not allow any gifting to occur. From 1916 until 1986 the old store stood as a shiny white beacon to the travelers heading north on Dodd through Rosemount. In 1986 the building was deemed to be too much trouble and it was agreed that it should be demolished. The city council didn't help that matter by constantly dragging my Grandparent's in to talk about a spring that was purported to lay under the old building. To our knowledge they never found such a spring. From the beginning my Grandparents weathered the storms that came with inheriting a financially failing business. Grandpa and Grandma took this financially failing business and turned it into one that generated close to a million dollars each year. Grandpa prior to taking over his family business taught the Dale Carnegie's business courses. After he took over the business Grandpa joined the 500 million dollar club in lawn and garden besides being named the top salesman in the tristate area in the same category. My Grandparents were proud to serve the citizens of Rosemount. The downside to owning a small business was not lost on Dick and Pody and they knew all too well the struggles of keeping a business going; this of course came with its owns costs. I am friend to small businesses because I do believe they are valuable to a city's local economy and help ease the unemployment rate at the local level. While big businesses have their place the quality of services and product often cannot compare to that from a small business; most small businesses take pride in the service and product quality that they provide. Due to the fact that small businesses are not as wealthy as the big box stores they instead have to rely on their reputation for quality workmanship and/or services. Small businesses get taxed as if they are wealthy but wealthy businesses don't get taxed the amount that they should. Companies like Walmart and Amazon contribute to the number of employees on government programs. While they may fix the employment problem they contribute to the continued need for welfare. Small businesses provide their employees a quality of life and a sense of purpose that big businesses are unable to offer with their heartless policies and cutthroat sales tactics. Often these employers drive out small businesses because they can pay more in taxes than a small business can. City Governments often care more about the profit they can make over the quality of life of their citizens. Small businesses have been studied in other countries and it was found that the quality of life was marked higher than those who worked in big businesses. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics small businesses are able to provide a wider range of benefits than big businesses with paid holidays vacation sick time retirement benefits and insurance being among the most offered benefits for small businesses. We must protect the working class with Unions and by allowing small businesses to grow and flourish. So now let's talk about the ways politicians get you to vote for them and why my campaign is different.  We have heard them every election year politicians running their smear campaigns against their opponents. While annoying to many of us by the time November rolls around these ads are actually quite effective. These ads do help people lean towards one candidate or another. These politicians are trained on what they have to promise in order to be elected. Every time you watch one of those ads you can be assured that someone was behind it all pulling the strings. Campaigns launch less than honest means to get votes don't believe me search for campaign management on Youtube sometime. They use children family or fears in their ads to get you to vote and the scary part these tactics psychologically get you to vote for or against a candidate. To win public office yes you must compete with others however unlike most races the ethical rules for candidates largely involve finances and the dissemination of dishonest or outright false material. I am on record with stating that I believe these campaign methods while effective not only are dishonorable but cheapen the office for which the politician is running for. I will answer any attack made upon me by a fellow candidate and I will do it with honesty and integrity. To do anything less is not only shameful conduct but and this is my belief should disqualify a politician from ever holding a public office. There was a time in this country where we believed in ethically campaigning for office. What a person did in their bedroom or in their private lives was off limits because it had nothing to do with the office they were running for. Somewhere along the way our country started to favor a more gladiatorial spectacle than that of honesty and integrity. Politicians being the gladiators and the public being the emperor; remember thumbs up the gladiator lived down they died. You have heard it said that an honest person cannot be elected to office but how we wish we could go back to that. Every year we hear politicians make campaign promises that they never deliver on. They know that if they make enough promises that sound great you will likely elect them. When they fail they don't take responsibility rather they shove it off onto somebody else. If I make a promise that I cannot keep because of mitigating factors I will ensure that I take responsibility for the promise and that I explain why I was not able to deliver on it. The values of honesty and integrity do still matter and we must hold politicians accountable who use less than honest means to charm you into voting for them. So how is my campaign different. First I am not made of money and so the likelihood of seeing a political campaign commercial paid for by me is very slim. I would rather people donate their time or contribute by telling others about my campaign. If I feel that a campaign account needs to be set up I will alert donors to this fact. I will run an honest and ethical campaign I am not going to lower myself to the level of those who oppose me the office of the Governor must be above that. If I am to be elected it will be on the content of my character my honesty and my will to do good for this state. I want to be a governor in the people's heart not psychologically maneuver them to vote for me.  This may lead to the question of how then am I qualified to lead this state? if you want experience in public office you'll find none. The experience that I have is in dealing with the public and listening to the experiences of those who are older than myself. I have worked with the public for 15+ years and been paid for only 6 of those years. I have volunteered for the American Legion at their brat and hot dog stand raising funds for ""Veterans on the lake."" This organization takes both able bodied and disabled veterans as well as active duty military their family and friends and allows them to have a fishing vacation away from the problems of civilization. I volunteered 10+ years with the American Legion and I am proud to call those tenacious veterans my friends. Most are veterans of Vietnam and Korea servicemen and women that were largely unappreciated when they came home from fighting overseas. The biggest thing that I believe makes me qualified for public office is my willingness to make things better for the State. How many times have you applied for a job and have been told to reapply when you have more experience? I call these the ""Thank you but no thank you"" letters. How can one gain experience if nobody is willing to let them get their foot in the door. No I didn't plan on making a career of politics but in light of all the recent events I feel it is time a citizen not a politician takes the oath of office and begins to work with our citizens to accomplish a better Minnesota. The shootings the riots the attack on the US Capitol and everything else that has happened has reminded me of this question posed in the movie Lincoln: ""Do you think we choose to be born? Or are we fitted to the times we are born into?."" Out of all the candidates that are running for the same office as I am all of them have held public office and therefore may be seen as more qualified than I am. However if we continue to complain but do nothing to change it we will continue to elect the same politicians we claim to despise. I feel that I have been fitted to the times into which I was born. I don't have to be the most qualified person in America I just have to be the most qualified out of those running for office. Honestly I have to be more qualified than the same tired politicians that we have elected time and time again. Only you can make that decision though. If you truly want the government that Lincoln spoke of in his Gettysburg address that Government of the people by the people and for the people then I ask that you stray away from the traditional candidates and take your chance on me. I can't let you down because if I do I not only let you down but I let my family friends and future generations down. How could I face my children as a failure. I will hold myself accountable to the people who have elected me and not to the party that nominated me. In the end the nomination doesn't matter it is the voters that take their chance on me the ones that place their trust and faith in me; those are who matter and those are the people that I must work for!  Good Morning to all of you on this beautiful Friday I thank all of you for doing your job today because I know many of you have very thankless jobs. You are appreciated by me and always will be. You make this State the best in the Union and make our Country a better place to live. Keep up the great work!",political,Facebook
Over the last few weeks many people have contacted our office requesting representation because their respective employers are introducing a vaccine mandate and employees who refuse to vaccinate will lose their jobs. We declined to represent each of these potential clients (and politely declined attempts to discuss vaccines and politics) and we explained that California law allows employers to require vaccinations with very limited exceptions. Whether the vaccine has emergency use approval (as some callers have pointed-out) is irrelevant to private employers in California although the vaccine now has full approval. The bottom line is that just as individuals have a choice of whether to vaccinate employers have a choice of whether to require vaccinations. Both groups have these choices and must deal with the consequences. Its worth noting that if any employer requires employee to vaccinate the employer must pay for the time spent getting the vaccine including travel time. #vaccine #employmentlaw #humanresources #hiring,political,Facebook
I was so proud to celebrate and participate at a number of Juneteenth events over the weekend in Chester Upper Darby Swarthmore and Collingdale. Proud to see the attendance of people from all walks of life to celebrate the end of one of darkest periods in our country's history. As Im sure many others have posted but its true we still have much work to do. Recognizing the atrocities of the past is one thing but we need to work on the current climate. We need to attack the wage gap create good paying jobs with a living wage and Im not talking about across the Country I mean right here in Delaware County. I had a nice conversation with a few of our elected officials and a number of Community Leaders about jobs in the area. Everyone seemed optimistic for the future but had no specifics. Id like to see that change moving forward. I tried to speak with our Congresswoman Mary Gay Scanlon but she disppeared too quiclkly in Chester and sent an assistant to speak for her in Collingdale. Like I said I loved the energy of Juneteenth and I hope we dont lose momentum and start to attack the issues that are holding people back in 2021.,political,Facebook
Fairfield Citizens  As you the residents of Fairfield return to the polls on Tuesday October 6th I would like to take a moment to speak from my heart about my current leadership as mayor to the great citizens of Fairfield. When I accepted the responsibility of mayor the city was already in deep financial debt and hard decisions needed to be made which are ultimately putting the city back on the road to recovery.  Fairfield has over a one million per year deficit and very high bond payment requirements and that leaves us with less revenue than the amount required to fund city operations. With that deficit there was no alternative but to file bankruptcy or watch the city dissolve.  Chapter 9 Municipal Bankruptcy is giving Fairfield an opportunity to reorganize financially and make a FRESH START because the city has been operating in house bankruptcy for several years.  Im very happy that I had the support of the council to take this important step to give Fairfield that FRESH START and to save Fairfield from total collapse. This is the leadership the city needs to return Fairfield to the level we expect. Please make no mistake about it without the Chapter 9 Municipal Bankruptcy filing the city would not survive.  Our youth and senior citizens are very important to this administration and we are scheduled to receive a grant for our plans to make the necessary repairs and reopen the community center. I have also renewed the senior citizens contract for meals on wheels.  The decision to partner with Sheriff Mark Pettway the Jefferson County Sheriffs department and our police department has been vital to crime reduction.  In Summary the city missed a $506000 bond payment in June and has a $322000 bond payment due in December. The city will have bond payments totaling well over $1.2 million in 2021.  Fairfield will survive with the financial plan that I have implemented. You can witness the confidence that businesses and the Jefferson County commissioners have in my plan because we have several new businesses getting ready to open up and more have planes to come to Fairfield. The new businesses are bringing in revenue and new jobs for the residents.  With my bold and honest leadership and the partnership of you the citizens of Fairfield our city will survive and we will again become that thriving community that we all know and love.  Thank you  Mayor Eddie Penny,political,Facebook
Dear Victoria Resident  My name is Chad Roberts and I am running for Victoria City Council. I wanted you to get to know me a little better and what I stand for. In these crazy times I thought it would be easier and safer in lieu of knocking on doors. I hope you will take a few minutes to read this.  I grew up in a small town of roughly 700 people in Northwest Wisconsin (no I am not a Packer fan!). I graduated with approximately 50 kids in my senior class. Growing up in that small town shaped who I am today.  After graduating high school I went to the University of Wisconsin River Falls where I met my wife Kate. I graduated with a degree in History and after graduating I went to paralegal school where I received my paralegal certificate. Shortly after I was lucky enough to be hired by one of the best Intellectual Property law firms in the world and I just celebrated my 19-year anniversary with that same firm in early September.  My wife and I have two children Mamush (6th grade  12 in October) and Scarlett (5th grade  10). In 2009 my wife and I adopted and brought home our son from Ethiopia. It was one of the most amazing experiences of my life and something I will never forget. A few weeks later with jetlag still not going away we found out my wife was pregnant with our daughter! In our household we fully believe children come on their own terms!  When my wife and I adopted our son from Ethiopia we had the privilege and honor to meet his birth mother. Through two interpreters we were able to ask her what she hoped and dreamed for her son. Her one wish was for him to get a good education school was very important to her. Supporting our schools is very important to me my grandfather was a teacher and my father is still one. I went to college thinking I wanted to be a teacher but decided against it right before student teaching started.  As a City Council member I will not have any say in the schools but they will always have my support. If outside organizations come in spreading lies or other figures in our community help spread those lies I will not be afraid to speak up against them. If I disagree with our schools I wont be afraid to reach out to board members and administrators to talk through the issues instead of airing those differences in the media for political gain.  I believe in equity and having an inclusive community. One way to do this it by creating more jobs and housing opportunities for families of every income level. Expanding the businesses we have in Victoria would help increase revenue which would also potentially take some of the burden off property owners.  Events of the past year have really made me think about what is important. People can affect change many different ways and this is my opportunity to serve the community and help affect change. I want to use the position to help shine a positive light on our community to help it grow and thrive. I believe we can have difficult conversations while collaborating to create a less divisive atmosphere.  I have only lived in Victoria for five years come October but it is now my community it is my home. I want everyone who moves to Victoria to feel as welcomed as my family felt when we moved here. Victoria is a wonderful place to live. I appreciate supporting locally owned businesses and believe we have the best restaurants/drinking establishments in Carver County! I enjoy having neighbors that lookout and take care of each other; and of course I love that Victoria has an abundance of large trees farm fields beautiful lakes and parks. I want to see our community continue to develop grow and thrive but I also dont want us to lose that feeling of community that small town feel that rural living that many of us moved out here to enjoy.  Thank you for taking time to read a little bit more about me. You can find more about me on Facebook @chadjrobertsforcitycouncil. Feel free to reach out to me on Facebook or email directly at cjr690@gmail.com. I would appreciate your support and have yard signs available if you would like to help me spread the word.  Thank you and I look forward to continuing to earn your support and your vote on November 3.  Chad J. Roberts,political,Facebook
QUESTIONS ASKED BY WJHG  1. Why are you running for Bay Countys District 4 commission seat? I decided to run for the Bay County Commission District 4 because I want to help improve Bay County so that our residents kids and grandkids will grow up being proud of this area and that there will be plenty of good jobs and reasons why they will want to stay here and enjoy our high-quality life. Also being a resident of District 4 most of my life I am very aware of the concerns the citizens of this district have and want to help resolve them.  2. What are your top three priorities if elected? -Addressing roads and drainage issues in all of Bay County particularly in my district. -Plan and provide funding for parks playgrounds and recreational complexes to improve quality of life. -Make sure citizens suggestions and concerns are heard and considered as well as make sure tax dollars are properly allocated and spent.  3. What do you want voters to know about your qualifications for this position? I started in business when I was 21. From starting my own business at such a young age and by being a long-time business owner I have learned a tremendous amount from all aspects to include: All types of Insurance coverages Wages Employee/customer relations Bid process  contracts with local state and federal government as well as contracts with schools colleges and churches Worked with non-profit organizations Knowledge of building codes code enforcement regulations land use and development law and ordinances buying & selling real estate commercial and residential leasing Finances  Also as being a father of 5 children step father and a husband I have learned how to deal with family issues. I have coached baseball and football past president of Hiland Park Football and Cheer. In 2009 I was among the group of good people to start the Gulf Coast Football Association. Through all of this I have made mistakes and by no means am I perfect. So as your commissioner if you come to me with something more than likely it will not be anything I cannot relate to or have already dealt with. The people of this community who know me know that I am honest hard-working and reliable.  Thank you for the opportunity to share with you my thoughts on these matters. Sincerely Eric Orme,political,Facebook
"Just under two weeks left until the election. Its been an interesting experience to say the least. Ive been accused of being a hardcore republican and Ive been accused of betraying republicans. False rumors have been spread that I sued my neighbors over arborvitae. Others have said I cut deals with current board members to get appointed later this is also false.  What I have done in an attempt to make our district better is get between two political machines mainly out for each other. Ive made unexpected new friends and connections with people of many different backgrounds. Its truly amazing how much you have in common with people when you reach out and just talk with them.  My incumbent opponent says she ""successfully navigated a safe return to schools using data informed approaches and public health guidance."" In my opinion nothing could be farther from reality. Health organizations were calling for kids to be in schools but she not only voted to keep them closed but voted to create metrics making it harder for schools to open leaving many students at increased risk for abuse neglect depression anxiety drug use and even suicide.  My other opponents team sent political fliers to registered democrats pointing out that Im a registered republican. I did expand on their campaign slogan of Five Full Days because people want to know what else the challengers are offering beyond just getting back to school. The Beyond Five Full Days is a direct response to an online post by the chair of the NCSD school board asking what do you have other than opening the schools.  Interestingly the person who came up with that slogan was one of the many unexpected connections I have made with people who support my campaign and my vision. They believe I will do my best to make good on my belief that we need to teach the skills to succeed to all students conservative or liberal black white or any other skin color.  I believe America is still the land of opportunity and part of that opportunity is teaching children how to succeed in life. We need to teach our children how to provide for themselves and find their way in the world with honor and dignity. I dont believe that is a conservative value nor a liberal value its a human value. But how do we do this?  To make true advancements in our schools we must be focus on what will enable our students to succeed in life. I believe there are three practical things we can do.  1. Expand our career and technical education 2. Professional development for teachers 3. Public-private partnerships  Expand our career and technical education.  We need to better enable those entering the workforce directly with the skills direction and entrepreneurial spirit to enter apprenticeships in high-demand trades. Students need someone to believe in them and show them the way. We need to continue and grow the work already started at Sabin-Schellenberg.  We must enable all students with the know-how to secure family wage jobs through partnerships with businesses and trade organizations that need skilled employees.  Professional development for teachers  We are about to be hit by a tsunami of learning loss mental health needs and life-changing trauma from this year of distance learning. There are funds that are available to help deal with this from the various federal stimulus packages. We must ensure our teachers have every tool they need to meet students' needs when they return to full day on-site school.  Public-private partnerships  Public private partnerships feed directly into expanding our career and technical education. We must partner with private organizations trade unions and companies to establish school to career pathways where students can connect with real employers prior to graduation. Public-Private Partnerships are the next step in preparing our students to succeed.",political,Facebook

"Facts are important so it's tough to see people say that 'Maine doesn't benefit' from the Clean Energy Corridor. That's simply not true.  Apologies for the long post but the fact is: Maine benefits in quite a few ways starting with receiving some of the clean electricity that will come through the Corridor.  Last July Governor Mills negotiated with Hydro Quebec to buy some of that clean electricity for Maine too. It'll be enough to power 70000 homes or 10000 businesses and at a discounted rate. For example Massachusetts consumers will get this electricity for 6 cents per kilowatt-hour but Maine consumers will get it for 2.5 cents per kilowatt-hour.  Beyond that...  Towns that host a part of the corridor are expected receive increased tax revenue of $18 million. The City of Lewiston alone will get $7 million in new tax revenue the first year because of the substation. That's more than the Walmart distribution center added. Lewiston city officials are over the moon about it. One called it a ""life-saver for the city.""  Decreased co2 emissions will be the equivalent of 750000 fewer cars on the road in the region.  CMP is going to put another $200 million into upgrading Maine's electrical grid to make it more reliable and help it accept more renewables.  The project creates a $15 million fund to help Mainers install energy-efficient heat pumps.  With more stable energy supply coming into the grid Mainers will see fewer spikes in seasonal rates.  The project will invest $15 million in rural broadband internet access for Western Maine plus providing some of the infrastructure to allow the fiber-optic cable to be run.  Maine snowmobilers will get another 50 miles of straightaways and wood mats used during construction will be donated to snowmobile clubs to be used as bridges.  The project will invest $15 million to help Maine expand its infrastructure for electric vehicles. More places to plug in.  The project will proactively invest $140 million in lowering CMP customers' energy bills. Plus $50 million in rate-relief specifically for low-income consumers.  The project is giving the state $6 million in funding for a variety of educational purposes.  The project is investing $6 million in Maine's land-conservation fund which is run by the Nature Conservancy. Plus the 40000 acres that the project will preserve on its own.  The new electricity that comes through will lower rates for Maine consumers to a combined tune of somewhere between $14 million and $44 million a year.  Seven small timber mills from Maine were awarded $20 million in contracts to make mats... which is great from the logging industry in that part of the state.  The Passamaquoddy Tribe will receive $2.5 million in benefits.  The project will invest $10.5 million in economic development and tourism for Maine.  Plus of course the 1600 jobs that will be created during construction for which Mainers will be given preference. So far 360 of the 470 people hired for the project are from Maine which is great. 77 percent!  All told the project will add $573 million to Maine's economy not including the incidental impacts like the spending by workers at stores in host communities.",political,Facebook
Governor Cooper released his proposed budget for the next two years. This proposal presents an extraordinary opportunity to invest in a pandemic recovery that will benefit all corners and people of our state. It helps schools and children increases access to healthcare enhances protection for clean air and water invests in clean energy and invests massively in infrastructure. All of this will bring many new good jobs to NC. It would also almost double our state's savings. Here are some highlights (the link below is to the budget slides with more detail):  Education  Provides K-12 teachers 10% raises on average over the biennium and ensures all noncertified school personnel receive a minimum of $15/hour.  Invests more than $78 million in early education and child development.  Provides $80 million to help school districts hire more nurses counselors psychologists and social workers to support student physical and mental health.  Jobs and Infrastructure  Leverages available state funds as well as the states share of funds from the federal American Rescue Plan Act (ARP) which is expected to provide North Carolina over $15 billion in aid.  Invests to help small businesses thrive and provides funding to prepare rural and economically distressed communities for an innovation-based economy.  Proposes funding to address the disproportionate economic impact of COVID-19 on communities of color through increased support for minority-owned businesses.  Takes advantage of the states low debt and historically low interest rates and recommends placing a $4.7 billion General Obligation Bond on the November 2021 ballot to ask voters to address key infrastructure needs  Access to quality healthcare. It is time to expand Medicaid.  Expands Medicaid to provide access to health care for more than 600000 working North Carolinians keeping rural hospitals open and strong reducing the number of uninsured veterans helping fight the opioid epidemic and injecting over $5 billion in direct investment into the state by expanding Medicaid.  The American Rescue Plan provides an additional $1.7 billion in federal funds to support Medicaid expansion without the state covering any cost share for up to six years.  Clean Energy and a clean environment.  Invests over $100 million in expanding access to clean energy technologies investing in clean energy economic development and building the clean energy workforce pipeline to catalyze North Carolinas economy. Invests $10 million for clean energy economic development and $4.5 million in clean energy grants for homegrown start-ups and small businesses.  Clean safe water and air are essential for the health and well-being of North Carolinians. Includes more than $3.8 million each year for emerging compounds mitigation.  A safer more equitable North Carolina.  The COVID-19 pandemic continues to shine a light on long-standing inequities. This budget advances equity in our healthcare economic criminal justice and education systems allowing fair opportunities to share in our states recovery and success.

Reverse Course  The Captain of the ship in the American wheelhouse needs to call out Reverse Course or else the United States is heading closer and closer to the drop of an economic waterfall to which much damage will be inflicted.  The combination of an unsustainable $30 Trillion in debt and a soon to be $4 Trillion more plus a manufacturing base that has all but been hollowed out and sold to China is spelling out in shining red flashing letters stop this insanity and wake up from this self imposed hypnotic trance that all is well and Reverse Course!  But what course should we reverse to?  We need a complete reversal of policy on American manufacturing and begin to re-build that infrastructure throughout the United States but this time with a focus on smaller niche manufacturing hubs in small towns and rural America.  Yes Artificial Intelligence (AI) is replacing many manufacturing jobs but there are still jobs that only humans can do and there must be an intelligent plan of action that outlines a blueprint for American growth and prosperity that can be set in motion and accomplished by 2032.  We need to take action now and recapture the American ideals and values that made us who we are.  China has a revenue and savings base of $45 Trillion dollars that are now being unleashed throughout many parts of the world to build infrastructure in many developing countries. They will very probably soon demand that all exports and imports be transacted in Chinese Renminbi currency and back that currency by gold and this could have dire economic consequences to the dollar as the worlds reserve currency.  No military can save us from economic defeat for a shot need not even be fired in such a scenario. We must reverse course and return to sound monetary policy to build the industrial base in this country. Social programs are important but without real productive growth our economy can not be sustained through the printing of Trillions of dollars. This is not real growth. It is fake growth. We need to reverse course. Now.,political,Facebook
I received an unsigned email from Open Records which a group I am not familiar with. There were some good questions there so Ill answer the relevant ones here.  1. If you are a Commissioner now how long have you served?  I am not currently serving on the Board but have served the citizens of Caln as a Commissioner three different times. Once elected and twice appointed to serve out leaving Commissioners terms. I was appointed because of my experiences on the Board and could hit the ground running. One of these appointments was due to the untimely passing of Commissioner Contento. I am also still serving on the Caln Civil Service Board which vets police officers prior to hiring them.  2. If you are a Commissioner or served previously what did you accomplish while in your position?  I did not accomplish anything by myself rather I was one of five Commissioners who worked together with our township staff for the betterment of our community. Some of the accomplishments that were done while I was on the board are: - NEVER raising taxes! - Miles of sidewalks along Baily Rd Barley Sheaf Rd Lincoln Hwy and others - Oversight of the upkeep of our roads sewer trash and parks - Upgraded the playgrounds at our parks - Updating and modernizing our codes and zoning - Responsible oversight of new development - Fighting to remove the blight and empty store fronts within out township - And many more  3. If you are running to become a Commissioner why should residents vote for you instead of the present Commissioners running?  In my opinion this is a baited question asking me to provide negative comments about the current board. There are several local Facebook pages that provide enough of this negativity and misinformation. I have worked with and am friends with all the current Commissioners and respect their opinions.  4. If you are running to become a Commissioner what do you want to accomplish by becoming a Commissioner?  Responsible development and storm water are very pressing issues right now. I would continue to work with developers and Mom & Pop entrepreneurs to bring in the businesses that Caln needs. Storm water runoff has devastated many properties recently. We need to assure developers are adhering to the codes that require them to mitigate stormwater run-off and determine what we can legally do to address excessive run-off from existing properties. Lastly maintaining our fiscal responsibility and not raising taxes is something I feel strongly about. The Boards I served on did a great job of this even during the recession 10 years ago.  5. Flooding was a major problem and will continue to be a problem. What do you see Caln township doing to help residents?  I answered this above. We also need to hold PennDOTs feet to the fire to address stormwater issues on the roads and areas they maintain.  6. What is your opinion of density housing?  That depends on the density and where it is in the Township. For example I would be for something like a mixed use Town Center on the former Kmart property. Multi-level apartments/condos over ground level retail would be a great use for that area. It would bring residents businesses and jobs to Caln and provide walking access to stores and the train station. Density needs to be addressed on a case-by-case basis.  7. What is your opinion of Open Space?  I love open space!! While serving on the Board this was addressed many times during my terms. Keeping and adding open space in our township would be something I would strongly work for.  8. What is your opinion of Spackman Farm and Historical Properties in Caln?  I live near the Spackman Farm and drive by it daily. I was very disheartened when it was blocked off because my 5 children and I used to hike the property regularly. I am 100% for improving the driveway and making the buildings safe so that all of Calns residents can return to using this wonderful property. There have been multiple attempts to add trails parking lots and other outdoor activities but there have never been enough votes on the board to do this. I would be a YES vote to any responsible budgeted efforts to make this a wonderful open space and park for our community!!!  9. What one thing would you say to a resident if you ran into them on the street or in a store?  I do this daily and would reiterate my dedication to this amazing Township and do everything in my power to better it.  10. Give us one sentence that sums up your qualifications to BE a Commissioner.  I LOVE CALN TOWNSHIP!,political,Facebook
For Immediate Release: Our Response To President Bidens Visit to Idaho.  Mr. President We hope you enjoyed your time in Idaho this week. It must be a good feeling to get out of Washington DC. Unfortunately we were not able to connect while you were here. If we had been able to meet there are a few topics we would have discussed:  As with all things in life there are areas you can directly control those you influence and others you have no control over. As President there are clear boundaries about what you can control. As the 10th amendment says you can only do what is explicitly called out in the Constitution. Everything else must be done by influence. The Legislative branch has the ability to create laws but you do not. EVERYTHING else is owned by the states or individuals.  Over the past nine months of your presidency you have consistently overstepped your authority with states rights. Here in Idaho we believe in self-reliance and independence. Idahoans know what is best for Idaho - not you.  In addition the policies you have enacted are negatively impacting the next generation of Americans that we represent:  - Most small businesses are owned by the under 40 group. Increased regulation tax increases and mandates are suffocating small businesses. Thousands have closed their doors.  - Inconsistencies in your COVID communication is causing confusion and mistrust. Decisions on schools impact our children. Parents are trying to juggle careers with potentially having to stay home due to closures. Vaccine mandates risk the jobs for many young professionals. The federal government has no place in requiring private citizens or businesses to be vaccinated. You have violated your promise to never mandate vaccines when you campaigned. It also sets precedent for a scary future. You are not exhibiting leadership. It is coercion.  - The rising inflation is hitting Americans at a time without much discretionary spending available. Inflation is the highest since the 1970s. Home prices are the highest in history. Gas prices are averaging $2 per gallon HIGHER than just 10 months ago. While it may appear great to have a wage increase in jobs it doesnt matter if the cost increase is higher to do business. Those costs are passed down to consumers or businesses stop hiring as many people.  - Your unwillingness to address crime and homelessness in the country is impacting Idaho. Look at Seattle Chicago New York Portland. Do you really believe things are going well there? We have thousands of people from these states fleeing into Idaho because of the failed policies there. This is placing tremendous pressure on Idaho infrastructure land and energy use and more.  - A really in-depth conversation is needed about your foreign and military policy. We are very disappointed in your handling of Afghanistan to put it politely. The mismanagement cost the lives of young Americans.  - You came to discuss wildfires in Idaho but it turned into statements about global warming. While we all agree in being good stewards of the environment you neglected to the discuss the mismanagement of federal lands that make up about 70% of Idaho. This increases the likelihood of devastating forest fires.  Overall if you look at many of the nations key performance indicators almost all of them are trending worse than just one year ago. You must recognize this. Your poll numbers are lower and decreasing faster than any President during their first year in office.  Please recognize that we arent seeking to condemn. We genuinely want to help. You are the President currently. If you fail America fails. Please let us know if you have time to discuss further. Wed be happy to meet with you.  Oh one last thing It seems like every time you try to take questions your microphone stops working. Wed be happy to buy you a megaphone so you dont run into these technical issues anymore.  Sincerely Idaho Young Republicans    #idpol #idleg,political,Facebook
My name is Linda Cherry. I am running for re-election for City Council and I'm asking you to please vote for me. Some of you may be familiar with my name but may not know me. The following is a brief history of my connections to the citizens of Murray before and during my tenure as your city council representative. You will find as you scan this list that my interests mostly involve connecting with and serving citizens who often feel disenfranchised and/or overlooked. *Volunteer CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocate for children) for 3years. *Volunteer tutor for residents of the New Beginnings Transition Home for Women who are recently released from jail/prison and want to take the GED. *Volunteer for Merryman House Domestic Violence against women and children. *Volunteer to stay at the warming center at St. John's Episcopal Church to receive anyone or families who need a warm safe place to sleep during extremely cold weather. Being involved in these volunteer opportunities has helped me see the need to work toward making Murray a better place for all of it's citizens. One ordinance I felt strongly about was the Payroll Tax. I voted against the Payroll Tax because it unfairly added a financial burden on the backs of single parents as well as employees who could only work part time jobs. Few of these citizens own their own homes. Those of us who are gainfully employed or retired received the benefit of insurance tax reduction and property tax reduction.,political,Facebook

"WAGES vs. INFLATION  So here we go with all of the inflation talk again; one could see it coming from the planet Pluto. Capitalism in the current environment is apparently incapable of providing real wage gains to workers. Wage gains currently reflected in increased unemployment benefits and one time transfers have shrunk the pool of available workers enabling available workers to demand higher wages.  Wage gains create inflationary pressures and the Federal Reserve's job is to maintain price stability--roughly defined at a 2% inflation target. If the rate exceeds this for a period of time the Nation's central bank the Federal Reserve (FED) will target higher interest rates effectively reducing the Nation's money supply in order to diminish both employment and wage demands.  The Federal Reserve (FED) has determined itself to run inflation a little hot above the 2% rate for a while and justifies this for having been unable to achieve its 2% inflation target for most years since the Great Financial Crisis. But a 4.2% annual inflation rate measure for the last monthly period has many analysts speculating the FED will tighten sooner then it had expected. Either way interest rates are going up; either the inflation component of the rate will rise or if the FED tightens the real component of the rate will rise. Higher interest rates mean lower asset asset values.  The general consensus in the markets is that inflation is bad so the FED while it will initially be patient with an inflation rate which exceeds 2% will quickly move to higher rates when it deems inflation a credible threat to longer term financial stability.  The whole point of this process is to slow down the economy in order to reduce employment and wage increase demands. So as stated above a capitalist economy is incapable of providing wage gains. This leaves the worker where the worker has often resided during the past decades in a weekly struggle to maintain housing utilities adequate healthy food and adequate healthcare. Not much has changed.  Is there a way out of this daily struggle for decent existence among the working class? The management class will say yes; productivity gains will enable working class advancement. In another era perhaps this was true; but this has proven false in a world of abundant labor and increased technological takeover of many human jobs. There is an excess of global labor so capital will either flee elsewhere in the face of wage gains and if not flee elsewhere capital will replace the worker with technology or a machine. Consequently the worker is left in a diminished job market with diminished market value.  Wages which equal market value is the problem. Imagine a world where technology leaves half of the world unemployed. What kind of wage will an additional worker to the labor force be able to demand? This is their market value. There must be a recognition that ""subsidies"" are necessary for workers to live a decent life. Subsidies are put in quotes here because subsidies are a very accounting specific measurement. Current accounting measures do not measure broader public gains and losses due to economic activity they measure only gains and losses specific to the private firm or to other corporate bodies. This aside if operating in an inflationary market this subsidy to the worker must represent a transfer of consumption from the upper classes to the lower classes in order to relieve inflationary pressure on production capacities.  This is why we should get nervous over union wage demands. It's not that their demands are not justified they are justified but their strategy for wage gains is very short term cannot last and fails to recognize that capitalism itself based on accounting measures of profits and inflation is incapable of advancing the material requirements of it's working class population.  Capitalism accounting does not account for the value added to a nation through a fully employed and well-educated populace. Both full employment and enhanced educational investment create short term inflationary pressures which lead to fears of an inflationary cycle. Consequently the two things which would advance the working class position: full employment which drives up wage rates and a good education which will advance future earnings are denied to them in order to prevent inflationary pressure.  It is all very structural and the system has little choice but to react in the manner in which it does in order to protect the private firm's balance sheet i.e. in order to avoid default. The tightening is painful for the firm but necessary in order to preserve the system with some level of stability.  Unions would be more effective if they united in a joint force and organized nonunion workers to join them in a mass political movement which demanded national economic policies which will actually improve workers' long term positions.  If wage gains produce inflation which forces the FED to take action which reverses those wage gains then this is a recognition that there is undue pressure on productive capacity. The FED policy makers and other analysts are correct that pressure on these facilities must be relieved in order to reduce inflationary pressures but labor needs to demand that the management class look elsewhere to relieve this pressure. Where elsewhere to look? At those who already consume too much. Why should struggling workers sacrifice their meager consumption in order to deflate inflationary pressures? It would be better to limit consumption among the well-off who already consume too much.  This transfer of consumption from the well-off to the unwell-off is most easily achieved through higher progressive tax rates. Lest we forget all was reasonably well when ""The top marginal tax rate in 1960 was 91% which applied to income over $200000 (for single filers) or $400000 (for married filers)  thresholds which correspond to approximately $1.5 million and $3 million respectively in today's dollars."" (). These higher progressive tax rates eliminated much of the excessive consumption which we see today freeing up resources for greater consumption among favored groups within the working class.  Meanwhile all the hope that the numerous labor disturbances across the globe will generate lasting advances for labor should be set aside. Under the current system with current accounting measures the world's central banks are forced to limit even reverse gains made by the working classes. Broader structural change is needed to serve working class needs. A transfer of consumption from the overconsuming portion of the population to the under consuming portions of the population will relieve pressure on productive capacity to allow greater consumption among the working class in a non-inflationary manner.",political,Facebook
Pardon my absence. Life has been happening. I wrote the following though the list is incomplete:  Leftists in their worldview decide what they want to be true act as if its true and demand that you act as if its true as well. Understand that leftists are religious fanatics and label all of those who oppose the leftist faith as racists white supremacists misogynists etc. They will then do all that they can to destroy the lives and families of those who do not follow the faith.  Here are some prime examples of untrue things that the left holds as self-evident truths.  A biological male becomes female when he says hes female Biological men have no advantage over women in sports The number of genders cannot be counted Nearly everything in life can be free The government can provide for all of societys needs All whites are racist no other race is racist Blacks who disagree with the faith are white supremacists Math is racist The English Language is racist. Spelling and grammar are racist Forcing children of color to learn the above is racist Everyone is an oppressor or oppressed. There are no people just trying to live life. You can raise the taxes on the rich and they wont leave Raising taxes on businesses will create jobs Building a business is greed Taking other peoples stuff isnt greed Abortion is a matter of my body my choice Vaccines arent a matter of my body my choice Voter IDs are racist Covid passports arent racist Small children should learn about the intricacies of sex including things like anal sex 18-year-olds shouldnt own guns 16-year-olds should be able to vote 14-year-olds should be able to get abortions without parental knowledge 3-year-olds should decide what gender they are If you take guns from law-abiding citizens criminals will stop shooting people Not arresting people for committing crimes will lower crime rates The protests that caused many deaths and billions in destruction were peaceful November 6 in DC was an attempted insurrection by violent extremists (though none had weapons) The biggest problem in the US military is white supremacy Organized Christianity is evil Orthodox Judaism is evil Islam is good and peaceful Israel is an oppressor. The Palestinian Authority and Hamas are forces for good America is the only nation on Earth who had slavery Pay no attention to modern nations who commit horrible human rights abuses.

The Newton Kansan asked for candidates to answer a few questions and for those who didn't get to read the article these are the questions and my responses.  Tell me one good thing about living in Newton you have experienced within the last year?  Its hard to narrow it down to just one good thing I have experienced over the last year but one that always comes to mind is how many people truly love this community and are willing to invest in making Newton a better place for everyone. Through my involvement in community service activities Ive met a tremendous number of Newtonians who are always willing to contribute their time talents education and experience to provide Newton a seemingly endless army of people who always want the best for Newtons future. I am amazed at their willingness to work hard as a team to make Newton a better place to live work and raise their families. We are truly blessed with great people in this community and Im proud to call myself a Newtonian and I hope that you are too.  What in your opinion is the top issue facing the community of Newton today?  Economic Development should be our number one priority. We must continue to focus on bringing new businesses to Newton and providing an avenue for small businesses to start grow and maintain in our community. Not only do we need this for economic growth but this also gives Newtonians more opportunity through higher paying jobs. This prosperity then helps generate additional tax revenue thats been lacking in Newton over the years. I would like us to be more attentive to the needs of Downtown.  What in your opinion is a solution you can bring to the commission to resolve this issue?  I believe someone who understands where we were where we are now and where we are going will be the best individuals who will bring the most value to our current commission. I believe I'm one of those people. Who we elect this year will have a great impact on the direction Newton is headed and the opportunities that await us in our near future. I am a person who will hold the line when it comes to not raising your taxes focusing on Economic Development being attentive involved transparent and accountable to all Newtonians with the things mentioned above. Understanding these things gives me a greater perspective when having something to contribute as a future commissioner here in Newton.  What unique skills or experience do you have that makes you a qualified candidate?  The ability to communicate effectively with Newtonians about issues pertaining to the City in its entirety. Communication is a two-way street it shouldnt come only from the city to Newtonians it also requires actively listening to what Newtonians are saying and what they do and dont want in their community. My Undergraduate Degree in Political Science has taught me a tremendous amount about how Government operates and my Graduate Degree in Communications has allowed me greater experience in effective communication skills especially in the avenue of citizen and government relationships. Im currently a teacher at Wichita State University and this has also given me a greater understanding of what our younger generation is looking for in terms of employment amenities and community life styles when they graduate and look for a community to live in. My life experiences have also provided me with a wealth of understanding the perspectives of all people from all walks of life.  What can the commission do to put or keep the city on a strong financial trajectory over the course of the next five years?  Do not raise taxes on Newtonians by maintaining the mill levy continue our focus on economic development housing opportunities for all socio-economic levels and paying down our debt thats been acquired over the last decade or more. As we move forward over the course of the next five years our focus should be paying down past debt and as we do this reinvesting those funds into our community through conservative long-term planning and development.  I believe in Newton the People of Newton and the Future of Newton!,political,Facebook
"RANDOM PSYCHOLOGY 132 A THIS WILL BE (BECOME) A LENGTHY ARTICLE I will write it over the next few nights if you have been with me for while you know generally at write at night. This about the ""white people""  a critique of not the white people themselves but how they are manipulated and used in our American politics. How the average white voter is misled and made to agree to policies that harm him/her. It is not news it has been known for a very long time. Of all our senses the vision is probably most important it is also the most corruptible. We not only see things as they are but also as we are told as to what we are looking at. We see things two people looking at the same things may see two totally different things. Politicians oy succeed if the can make us see things as they want us to see them. You and I could hear a politician and come back with totally different impressions what we heard there no absolute truths but we can find them if that is what we ourselves wish to find. A lie often repeated can become the truth only if that is what we wish to believe. Otherwise a lie is a lie. We deny the truth at our own peril if we fail to recognize the truth we hurt ourselves in the long run. This is what went wrong with the blacks and their leadership and this is what is wrong with the white leaders there is no difference as the black community has been destroyed by the falsehood preached by their leaders how can we believe that in the long run the lies being told by the white leaders will not harm the white communities. Money and education do make a difference as it is fact that many blacks have prospered by moving away from the message of their leadership the average white person ( lower economic staus) must also get away from the message of white leaders. No leader and no policy can eliminate all the various problems of a person or the society at large. If we follow our leaders blindly we are surely doomed. What is happening today is that we are ignoring the true problems of the society we are dividing the country we are blaming eachother while the politicians on both sides are selling us out. To say that the white people don't have lousy schools poor trash filled and ignored towns and neighborhoods that the poor whites don't have hunger problem teen pregnancy problem a serious drug problem a crime problem lack of healthcare and opportunity problem is to ignore the reality. Look around. M. N. R. 15 JUNE 2021 RANDOM PSYCHOLOGY 132 B There is a lot of talk these days about the ""CRITICAL RACE THEORY""  as is typical some politicians have made it on to a Black vs White issue. There is no doubt that the statements in the ""critical race theory"" are factual indeed but it also ignores the plight of all ""recent immigrants "" throughout the history of our country worse it ignores the genocide of the native Americans the confiscation of their lands and property the imprisonment of the Japanese citizens. It is well established that the American legal educational and even banking and housing systems have been ""racist"" and unfair. The bigger problem for the politicians is that if the facts become common public knowledge first they will not be able to use race baiting to keep the poor whites under control the poor whites will learn the tricks the politicians use at behest of the rich to oppress people and also that when the poor whites learn what was being done to the minorities was also the same that was being done to them. Today the homelessness the poor education  the lack of appropriate facilities and services are not the lot of just the minorities they also the lot of the poorer whites both suffer the same indignities. The smaller white communities in Alabama Mississippi Arkansas Virginia South Dakota New Mexico and elsewhere are no better off than the ghettos of Chicago and Baltimore and such drug use  prostitution welfare abuse petty crime lack of jobs lack of services even lack of food stores etc are same or similar. Go to a small town in a small county in Virginia or Kentucky poverty is beyond belief education is almost non exisistant jobs too. Majority are on assistance single moms with bad teeth in run down trailers and bare feet men are either on drugs or have left towns for jobs or just to run away from problems and responsibilities. It is small white ghettos. Petty crime  the police don't even care. More will follow  Please like the page comment let's talk. Thank you M. N. R. 16 JUNE 2021",political,Facebook
It was a hopeful day at the legislature as we passed a 2 billion dollar bonding bill in strong bi-partisan fashion 100-34. Even three weeks before the election we came together across the aisle to create jobs build up infrastructure and provide some supplemental budget measures that will serve Minnesotans now and in the future. Now the Senate needs to follow suit.  Provisions I worked on- 1) Temporary Covid Rate Increase for Personal Care Assistants: People with disabilities and older adults have had trouble accessing the care they need before COVID and it has been even worse since. This is because PCAs receive such low wages. We allocated $13 million that will provide a wage increase positively impacting 55000 PCAs in MN 82% of whom are women 60% are people of color. Many live in or near poverty while working multiple jobs.  2) The Northfield Transit Hub: $1.75 million is allocated to invest in this project that has been a priority of local businesses and manufacturers the colleges and the Northfield City Council. We need better transportation options in rural communities. Some households dont have access to a car or to multiple cars. Students need better connections to the metro. We need to better connect Northfield Faribault Lonsdale and Cannon Falls. This centralized transportation hub will help us increase use of public transportation. We are also poised to connect Northfield to the metro by passenger rail.  3) I authored a separate bill that allows farmers to apply for $5000 grants if they can show financial hardship due to COVID. There was a bucket of federal CARES Act $$ at the department of Ag that wasnt being fully utilized so we expanded who could apply to put those funds to use for farmers.,political,Facebook
Today once again I was asked why I would run because I am Conservative and my running may split the vote and allow a Democrat to win. I am going to break this down Barny style for you (as in Barny the dinosaur).  First I am not a Republican I am a Libertarian/Independent a Constitutional Conservitive and the current GOP is anything but that. I owe nothing to that party I am my own man through and through. Second what makes Michelle Fischbach entitled to be the only one running who is not a Democrat? Because she holds it now? No one can be more worthy? Is that it? I do not buy it. Third President Trump won this district with 65% of the vote if you are worried she might lose now because a Libertarian Independent is running that should tell you she should not be there to start with. Once she is gone the GOP leadership who put her there without input from the grass roots should probably be next to go.  For those in the GOP who are so scared of a Democrat winning because I am running. You Sir or Madam are as much a sheep as those you accuse of being sheep it maybe a different breed but a sheep none the less. You like to call yourself a wolf but a coyote/ hyaena may be a better analogy then a wolf eating off the plate of another. Because your scared you operate out of a fear of loss you are so scared to take a chance that may make things better because you would risk something. One word comes to mind. Coward. Do not try to talk me out of running because of your FEAR. I am not scared; I am putting myself on the line for this. If you keep voting for the lesser of two evils we should not have to listen to you complain about the results.  I believe in playing nice until it is time not to play nice (Roadhouse anyone?) and this is one of those times. President Trump tried to drain the swamp from the top from the throne so to speak. We all see how that worked out. While I am all about draining the swamp and fighting the establishment I do not operate from the top. I am a pig farmer who works in the trenches and I am not scared to get my hands a little dirty. It is a job that needs to be done (anyone know if Mike Rowe is still doing Dirty Jobs?).  I believe character is important I do not play the political games of not telling you where I stand on issues I say where I am and let the cards fall as they may. I am not a politician what you see is what you get. If this hurts your feelings you are probably everything you despise. If this does not show you I am not your normal politician nothing probably will this is ME this is the Bull that will run through DC.,political,Facebook
One week away from election. We have worked so hard since January. Researching listening building relationships and doing what it takes to earn your support.  At this time I would like to give you some details from our first 100 day plan. We all know our team stands on ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND MAKING THE CITY OF LOUISVILLE SAFER. WTBS we plan on working IMMEDIATELY with surrounding counties and entrepreneurs on bringing new industries into town. There is a great need for affordable housing in Louisville following the tornado in 2014 that left so many mourning the loss of their loved ones a well as their homes. Quality housing for young families looking to move here as well as those already establishing themselves here is a great need as well. We have already made connections with people and already have some plans in motion. I also think we can spread more city contracts in Louisville. Using the same vendors for services in Louisville doesnt spread the wealth throughout more entrepreneurs here. We plan to look into exploring some TIF District options to produce more industries immediately! I also plan to immediately get more involved with our school district.  We plan on working directly with our major factories here on offering technical training for the jobs of tomorrow for our teens. We plan to do this through paid internships. There are grants available for this type of assistance and my associates are already on top of doing what it takes to be eligible for them. I think teaching teens how to weld paint sew farm hook up electricity proper etc will create a more stable employability pipeline in Louisville.  I am very passionate about cracking down on crime in Louisville. I think we must get more serious about murder burglary robbery and drugs in Louisville. Especially when it comes to our teens. We have a lot of teens in our area with guns in their hand. That is one reason why we have plans for a gun buy back program. All unregistered guns stolen guns etc turned in will be rewarded by knocking off some funds on their fines. Let's not shy away from the truth! I think our investigators could have more resources to help solve crime. More police cars going home with officers WHO LIVE IN THE CITY LIMITS has been known to be successful in other areas as well. Research has shown that more police presence in the community helps lower crime. We must foster a better relationship between law enforcement and the community. We should be comfortable with our police officers. I feel there is a major distance between the two.  I also plan to research how we can get some state and federal assistance with our aging infrastructure. For example we have too many streets with pot holes. We also lack sidewalks throughout the city. A more walkable city in all areas help communities thrive. We could have more bike lanes in the city as well to help attract more bikers. It will make riding bikes safer for adults and children. All these things help attract more people to our town.  Last but not least we are very serious about more after school and recreational programs in Louisville. We need more programs for kids in single parent homes. These kids need help more than we know. I think this presence will help strengthen our community. I also have a great plan for prison reform. Something for serious convicts who want to come home and get back into the workforce. Another one of our immediate plans is to put two basketball goals at the Dawkins and MLK intersection. We only have 3 courts available in town and they are all in Ward 3 at one location. These plans are only a portion of our plans for better parks in Louisville. Only maintaining one park doesn't create use opportunities for all. There should be a park for kids near every major living area.  All these ideas are what we plan to jump into IMMEDIATELY if we are elected for office. Yes we are aware of the city budget however we wholeheartedly believe these ideas will help Louisville become a thriving community for all. The time is NOW Louisville. Let's be the change WE need!

"Here is todays economic lesson.  Businesses absorb additional costs (such as higher taxes) in 2 ways. 1. Lower costs (usually payroll) or 2. Raise revenue (prices of goods). This also reduces profit margins which slow investment and growth (new jobs).  But how does this hurt the tax payer and not the rich like the democrats keep promising?  Joe Biden says he wants to tax the rich those making over $400000 a year and raise taxes on corporations. Allow me to explain why this will cost you more money than it will cost the corporations and how this is a ploy to get tax payers to pay for more government programs while the democrats can pretend they are not going to tax the people.  (Borrowed example)  Let's say Walmart makes a Billion Dollars a year and Joe decides to take away 10% of that income $100 million. Walmart will pass that cost on to the consumer you and me! However because of the ""New"" tax structure they will need to raise prices about 12% to recover that hundred million Biden took. Not only will you pay higher prices but you will also pay additional sales tax because the retail price is higher. So that 10% old Joe took from the corporations will cost YOU between 12% and 15% depending on where you live. Oh by the way same thing for a $15 minimum wage; business passes those costs on to the consumer as well.  Now you might say well the rich will pay the higher price too and you are right but here is the catch. The average working person spends 98% of his or her income while the wealthy spend roughly 60% of their income.  Taxing corporations shift the tax burden to the middle and lower class but in a sneaky roundabout way. The Liberals know this they are just hoping that you are too uneducated to think for yourself!  In the end the cost of all goods and service will increase and the middle and lower classes will bear the burden!  Don't be fooled by promises of free stuff or more government benefits; there is no such thing as a free lunch. The folks WILL pay for it all in the end. There is no such thing as Government Money the money that the government has was confiscated from We the People!  (End of borrowed example)  There is a reason every American was benefiting from the Trump economy prior to the pandemic. A truly free market without government intervention or taxation grows from the bottom up and benefits the working class more than any other economic strategy.  Get out and vote!",political,Facebook
"A few weeks ago the chieftain sent a questionnaire to all candidates for city council. The responses for district 4 candidates have not been published yet. I will provide my full responses here.  Based on the upcoming council meeting agenda item 14 from mayor Vaus; it seems they agree with my concerns regarding internet in Poway. While I think the agenda item has a narrow scope for what is a much larger issue it is a move in the right direction. I believe there is still significant work needed to bring Poway into the ""technology age""; where internet is treated as an essential service that is readily available like water or electricity.  1) Why do you want to serve on the Poway City Council? South Poway has been unrepresented for far too long. I have been advocating for our values in issues like appointment reform gerrymandered districts preserving Big Stone Lodge and most recently the Fairfield development.  2) What do you see as the three greatest issues impacting Poway? Infrastructure Budget Development  3) How would you bring about change to the three issues mentioned above? Budget - We need to slim down redundant staff and diversify revenue.  Infrastructure - I want to see Poway identify the internet as a public utility in a similar fashion to Chattanooga. This would help with budget issues as well as create jobs benefit small businesses residents working from home and students.  Development - Protect current Prop FF land and explore expansion as well as identifying and correcting flaws in the PRSP.  4) What would you like voters to know about you? Though I have seen many places in the world thanks to my service in the Navy nothing compares to the life I have built with my family here in Poway.  5) Why should people vote for you? I have been leading efforts to inform the public and drive engagement as community issues arise. For example the Boil Water Advisory Big Stone Lodge and the Fairfield development.  6) What are your thoughts on the recovery of Poway businesses during and post-COVID? (refer to number 3 with regard to the public internet and the benefit to businesses)  7) What are your thoughts on the development plans for Poway Road? I will fight for community benefits that provide amenities to the residents over developer profits.",political,Facebook
"One thing democrats have. They always stick together. No matter how corrupt or dishonest a member is found to be they will support him or her and never abandon him. Hillary acid washed 33 000 emails after being subpoenaed but they never denounced her. Biden has been bribed but they stick by him.Maxine Waters encouraged open violence and they say and do nothing to her. No matter how corrupt how rotten when it is one of ""them"" they are behind him. Nothing is too scandalous or dirty or beneath their dignity if it is one of ""their own "". Not one democrat denounced the phony impeachment ! The fake news MSM allows them to get away with all their wrongdoings. The latest for the few days left before Election Day is to propagandize the ""Covid spikes and increases"". They can't fault Trump for the economy or for jobs or for trade deals or for the stock market rise.They cannot fault him for reducing taxes and regulations. They cannot criticize him for starting a war. They cannot fault him for the prosperity and wealth he created. They cannot fight MAGA or KAG.They cannot fault him for lack of ""ventilators"" and masks. They cannot say he is not close to having a vaccine for the virus. They can do one thing and one thing only. They can order the fake news and their operatives and their MSM corrupt allies and spinsters and activists and other hypocrite allies to falsely claim that the Covid is ""spiking"" and blame him for doing a terrible job in handling it. They can pretend as though if they were in charge nobody would have died. He acted sooner than all of them despite their criticism yet they say he killed two hundred thousand plus Americans. He acted while they were shamelessly trying to impeach him for no good reason. Any one else in his position would have been totally distracted  They the democrats would have let die millions. Cuomo was one who really caused the death of innocent elderly New Yorkers. Do not pay attention to these false claims of ""spikes"". This too is propaganda and misinformation and political warfare. None of my family or friends or their friends or their families have had any ""NEW"" Covid virus spike or sudden increase. Many others tell me the same thing. Check it out for yourselves.

Please read and share!!  Keeping taxes low while improving services. This is how I will do it:  1. I will continue efforts to grow the Grand List  I will hold the line on new spending and keep Shelton predictable.  I will overtime work with Boards and Commissions to build a reasonable rainy day fund so we can weather any challenges ahead.  I will support well planned and appropriate development for our city.  I will level the playing field for investors and businesses so we get the best proposals for Shelton not only proposals from the same favored insiders.  I will work closely with property owners to fill vacancies and address underperforming properties.  I will work closely with the business community to ensure they have a good experience with the city so they stay and grow in Shelton.  2. I will improve management and operations.  I will immediately pursue an internal audit of all city expenses. I will ask those auditors to recommend improvements to our financial policies so the unfortunate theft and questionable practices of the past will not repeat themselves.  I will eliminate no-show jobs and department heads working from out of state. I will require that staff be in city performing their jobs for our residents each day.  I will listen collaborate and partner with departments Boards and Commissions outside organizations private businesses and other neighboring communities to address city priorities.  I will end costly ego based legal fees and lawsuits that are costing hundreds of thousands of dollars.  I will set a vision and priorities and communicate it to all city staff so we are working together to improve Shelton.  I will keep an ear to the ground for neighborhood issues so we can work together to make sure our neighborhoods are safe strong and wonderful places to raise families.  3. I will improve infrastructure and services.  I will divert the savings from no show jobs to hiring a full time grant writer that will bring in significantly more outside money annually to improve our roads buildings equipment public safety schoolsparks programs and serves. (Example- by eliminating the $80000 annual position for a Bridgeport State Representative who appears to be assigned to the police department but does not seem to reap much benefit to taxpayers is how I plan to fund this much needed position.) Eliminating this non-productive salary can be turned into millions!  I will meet with departments to get their ideas on how to improve services with our existing resources. Employees often have the best ideas they just have to be asked.  I will personally be in the city day in and day out not off seeking another elected office. I will take note of problems around our city and work with departments to address those problems.  I will hire highly qualified and community oriented staff for my team and we will greatly improve our constituent services out of the mayor's office. We will get back to people.  I will address the school bus situation so parents and children have safe and dependable transportation to and from school.  All of these efforts dont require new money from residents. We will better utilize our existing resources bring in new outside resources and/ or reallocate some resources.  We will do all of this and more together!,political,Facebook

Black Jack - The Modern Day Chauvinist: an American heros sexual exploitation of women cyber stalking and his keyboard bullying - by Alice Schell  Modern Day Chauvinism: Unjust male criticism toward females aggressive and exaggerated female patriotism unhealthy competition with women lack of respect toward women (usually disguised) and degradation of women.  Historically many writers used pen names to disguise their true identity from their day jobs not wanting their bosses or colleagues to know that they write a particular genre and be subject to unfair scrutiny or embarrassment. It may be unsettling for some to find out their doctor is a prolific writer of murder-mystery novels.  The truth is that only an adult who lacks common sense would assume that every fiction author writes novels about themselves. Fiction stories are simply that; not real not true and not based upon actual events. Do you think J.K. Rolling was a teenage wizard at some point in time and felt the need to write about it? Do you solidly believe that Mary Shelley was a mad scientist that created her own monster and decided to write a novel about it in 1817?  Due to my current and unpleasant experience with Black Jack I now fully grasp why female authors throughout history and currently are confined to using a pen name to protect themselves specifically from The Modern Day Chauvinist.  This past August 31st when the last plane carrying US forces left Afghanistan an uproar of civil disobedience was created within our country; American hearts were heavy political pressures and heated emotions rising I made the mistake of reposting on my Facebook page someone elses views that I found trustworthy - because I assumed the writer Black Jack being an American Hero was wisest of this terrifying situation.  My husband and I soon learned that this repost of mine turned out to be a disgusting error of misjudgment. This man is no hero he is The Modern Day Chauvinist; a wolf in sheeps clothing. Unbeknownst to me by reposting his thoughts of Afghanistan on my Facebook page I was indeed feeding the black beast.  The nightmare began. Can you objectively conclude that a mature college educated married women would be ignorant enough to try and hook-up with a man online publicly in front of the entire world to see and considering these factors?  *She is a happily married Christian women and proud mother of 4 children. *She is attractive intelligent and successful. *Her family & her husbands family participate in her daily social media. *She is a principal owner of her own company in service to others and valuing her reputation and integrity. *She is a community steward. *She comes from a lineage of military family and police officers. *She has a proven record of fidelity loyalty sacrifice and commitment to her family friends and business associates. *Her husband is an attractive physically fit man intelligent and successful and also a US Veteran. He is my best friend and my hero.  With all of Black Jacks cyber stalking efforts and knowing this public information this narcissistic still stalked me or in his terms he hunted me.  Listen Black Jack my husband and I have been married 3 happy years and are still in our honeymoon stage; are you that much of a desperate dumb donkey? My husband is a page administrator on my social media accounts. My husband is copied on every single post and comment of mine.  Stop the charade time to come clean and admit that you are a pig. You pathetically waited on a daily basis to see what I posted so that you could then post something in mockery of me to sexually exploit me to your friends.  I am disgusted that you treat your female fans and followers in this manner.  I mistakenly upheld Black Jack the retired Navy Seal as an American hero an exemplary author and an inspiration. However he is none of the above. He is a dark broken empty and weak out of shape coward with nothing left inside of him.  Black Jacks daily routine is posting blogs about world historical events which are wholly bias and the accuracy of the information is questionable. He excitedly tags celebrities on his pathetic posts hoping to gain free access to tactical equipment products and popularity and abuses his platform to cyber stalk womenLoser. Jacks close friendsLosers. And to the men out there who are just like him you know who you areLosers.  Jack was so cunning at defaming my character that my own social media followers started questioning my character and some ignorantly mocked me as well - a few of these being celebrated public figures. It was painful to ignore.  The most elementary of this satire is that if my pen name was John Schell Black Jack would of never attempted to sexually exploit me; The Modern Day Chauvinist.

Long-term economic development to me means we work now to make sure Mattoon is a place people want to live and work for generations to come. It also means we make smart sustainable investments in the community that will improve the welfare and quality of life for everyone.  So 1st to cover the employment/industry aspect of the economic long game we know that Lake Land is a major source of employment and I believe we need to more aggressively market Mattoon to companies that employ our Lake Land graduates. Offering incentives to those companies would be a smart and sustainable investment in our community.  And while we are talking about the Lakeland area I also think south Rt. 45 is a land of missed opportunity and now that the IL-16 exit has been so well developed its time for us to make South Rt. 45 exit a place people want to stop at too. A truck stop at the very least. Thats solid gas tax revenue we can use to improve some of our infrastructure.  Next to talk about the quality of life aspect of our economic long game... Modern Economic development means a lot more than just industry and business. It also addresses the social needs of the community. People want to live in a place that has recreation and entertainment as well educational and growth opportunities for all ages. Youth development family- friendly and senior programs places to visit shopping and dining. Also cultural and artistic opportunities that can grow our sense of community. And we can more aggressively market Mattoon in that way too. We do that my making our downtown area a place for all these things. My friend Rex said the words 'Brewery' and 'Time Theatre' in the same sentence the other day and I thought my brain was gonna blow up! Stuff like that. More music more outdoor theatre more things that encourage community involvement like by the city and the school system or the Lifespan Center or the YMCA working more closely together to develop more comprehensive and inclusive programs for all of our people. And we also need to have events that will bring in people from neighboring towns. Plan more events like the Celebrate Downtown Mattoon Christmas event. Plan events that highlight Mattoons really neat history and incorporate people's hobbies and interests such as combining the history of the railroad through Mattoon and hosting an event that would bring in railroad and model train enthusiasts.  Our economic long game also needs make our town a place of residential growth and development. Part of that is the city fulfilling their primary duty to the town providing for public safety. Making sure all of our city departments are adequately staffed and have the things they need to do their jobs. Restoring our existing neighborhoods by cleaning up the abandoned houses and public nuisance issuesas well as offering incentives to those wanting to restore or update their home. And pushing for development of new residential areas to attract families looking for a great place to raise their kids.  So thats my take on long term economic development. Local governments should always be looking to the future. They should be proactive as much a possible. They should encourage community involvement tell it like it is and bring all the ideas to the table when making city decisions. That is the kind of commissioner I will be and I would appreciate your vote on or before April 6th. #electable,political,Facebook
Spring is coming!!! At the meeting March 2 2021 they talked about some of the jobs that will need to be done for levee maintenance. Weed spraying will cost about $15000. Mowing will cost about $15000. and Gopher control will cost about $9000. They are still looking for someone to trap the beavers damming up the river. All of this is paid for with YOUR tax money.

But If you agree that it is important to share to make Americans aware we trust that you will. DA 2020  MARCH 2018  465.  March 1 2018  The FBI announced it was investigating a Russian oligarch Alexander Torshin for funneling money through the National Rifle Association to Donald Trumps campaign. Torshin who is the deputy governor of the Bank of Russia carries close interpersonal ties to the Kremlin.  466.  March 2 2018  William G. Otis Donald Trumps appointee for the Sentencing Commission which sets policy for punishing federal prisoners has favored abolishing the agency. Otis has also written a variety of racially charged statements on subjects ranging from violence to family structure. In one post on the legal blog Crime and Consequences Trumps new pick for the commission wrote When Fifth Circuit Judge Edith Jones said at a University of Pennsylvania Law School talk that blacks and Hispanics are more violent than whites a consortium of civil rights organizations filed a complaint. The complaint calls for stern discipline on the grounds that the remarks were discriminatory and biased. So far as I have been able to discover it makes no mention of the fact that theyre true.  467.  March 3 2018  Ignoring advice from his economic advisors Donald Trump chose to create steep tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. White House officials said Trumps decision which could result in a trade war was spur-of-the-momentmade without a strategy to alert trade partners without a legislative plan submitted to Congress and without any scheduled remarks beyond an email from the Commerce department drafted late at night on February 28th.  468.  March 3 2018  After Chinese President Xi Jinping altered the Chinese constitution to abolish his term limitsallowing him to retain power indefinitelyDonald Trump was recorded in a closed-door meeting as he said [Xis] now president for life. President for life I think its great. Maybe well have to give that a shot someday.  469.  March 4 2018  With midterm elections approaching the State Department was issued $120 million to combat election meddling from Russia; as of March 2018 they hadnt spent any of it.  470.  March 5 2018  In a move that may violate federal law the Trump Organization ordered new tee markers bearing the official presidential seal for one of their international golf courses. The law in question states the presidential seal or any facsimile thereof may not be used for any commercial purpose.  471.  As of March 2018  Donald Trump and Republicans in the House and the Senate used the Congressional Review Act with an unprecedented frequency. The act allowed the House to remove any regulation within 60 days of its enactment and has been the administrations weapon of choice in rolling back Obama-era regulations. Before Trump The Congressional Review Act had been used only one time; since Trump took office it has been exercised 15 times with dozens more rules proposed for removal.  472.  March 5 2018  The Trump administration announced it would allow hunters to import sport-hunted African elephant trophies on an application-by-application basis. The controversial hunting practice had been outlawed during the Obama administration. The U.S. Forest and Wildlife Service justified the decision by saying that findings on endangered species were no longer effective for making individual permit determinations for imports of sport-hunted African elephant trophies. The findings referenced as no longer effective were published just the year before.  473.  March 6 2018  The US Office Special Counsel announced Kellyanne Conway twice violated the Hatch Act a regulation which prohibits federal employees from publicly endorsing or criticizing candidates running for high-level positions. Conway had been a vocal advocate for Roy Moore in Alabamas Senate race last year speaking on Moores behalf during two Fox News interviews last year.  474.  March 6 2018  Chief Economic Advisor Gary Cohn resigned from the Trump Administration. Though no explicit reason was given for Cohns departure Trump had ignored Cohns long-standing advice against raising steel and aluminum tariffs earlier in the week causing many to speculate this was the impetus for Cohns exit.  475.  March 7 2018  Trumps chief of the U.S. Forest Service Tony Tooke resigned after allegations of sexual misconduct. PBS had released conversations with 34 women from the Forest Service discussing a culture of discrimination and sexual harassment. After the documentary aired it appeared Tooke was among those accused of sexual misconduct. The chief resigned from his post in an email to the agency. Tookes appointment occurred in August 2017 at the direction of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue.  476.  March 7 2018  Donald Trumps son-in-law Jared Kushner met with Mexican President Enrique Pea Nieto without the current US Ambassador to Mexico Roberta Jacobson. Kushner had almost no experience in international diplomacy while Jacobson served the US Government for 31 years as one of the nations leading experts on Latin America. Columbia Universitys Christopher Sabatini told the New York Times The sending of the presidents son-in-law  someone with no experience in Mexican-U.S. relations  is another example of the de-professionalization and personalization of diplomacy that will hurt U.S. interests and leverage in the region.  477.  March 7 2018  During questioning former Communications Director Hope Hicks revealed that two of her email accounts had been hacked and she still could not access either account. One of the hacked email addresses served as her primary contact while campaigning for Trump and the other was a personal address. Both the identity of the hackers and the sensitivity of the compromised information remained unknown.  478.  March 8 2018  The AP reported that one-third of the 59 people appointed to the EPA by President Trump have direct ties to fossil fuel companies either as registered lobbyists or as lawyers for chemical manufacturers.  479.  March 8 2018  The Interior Department planned to spend $139000 on six doors for Secretary Ryan Zinkes office.  480.  March 9 2018  EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt wanted to hold a series of public debates on whether or not climate change was real. Chief of Staff John Kelly deemed the debates unwise and told Pruitt to drop the idea according to White House officials. Those in the meeting with Kelly and Pruitt said Kelly considered the debates a distraction from the Trump administrations rollbacks of Obama-era legislation on climate change.  481.  March 10 2018  Donald Trump advocated for the execution of drug dealers as a means of addressing Americas drug problem. The previous year Trump was complimentary of Philippines President Rodrigo Dutertegoing so far as to invite him to the White Houseafter Duterte had been condemned by human rights groups for his extrajudicial killing of Filipino drug dealers.  482.  March 10 2018  Trump announced the US military would stage a military parade in Washington D.C. for veterans day in November 2018. After a trip to Paris for Bastille Day which included a French military parade Trump returned to the U.S. inspired to hold one himself. Criticism of the idea came from both sides of the aisle. At the very least it was considered a waste of resources as the parade will likely cost between $10 and $30 million.  483.  March 12 2018  House Republicans declared the Mueller investigation had failed to find any collusion between Donald Trump and the Russian. The statement released by the House Intelligence Committee was not reviewed by any of the Democrats on the committee before its publication. Rep. Adam Schiff one of the ranking Democrats on the committee tweeted BREAKING: GOP just shut down House Intel investigation leaving questions unanswered leads unexplored countless witnesses uncalled subpoenas unissued. If Russians have leverage over the President GOP has decided that it would rather not know. The minoritys work continues:  484.  March 12 2018  Department of Education head Betsy DeVos was interviewed on 60 Minutes and admitted she hadnt visited any underperforming schools and did not know basic public school statistics in her home state of Michigan.  485.  March 13 2018  Donald Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Trump had clashed with Tillerson in the past on everything from the Iran nuclear deal to issues of personal chemistry. In October it was rumored that Tillerson had called Trump a moron to senior staff members. To replace Tillerson Trump chose CIA Director Mike Pompeo who the president described as having a very similar thought process.  486.  March 20 2018  A citizen watchdog group named Public Citizen filed ethics complaints regarding significant conflicts of interest for 36 appointees in the Trump administration. These conflicts of interest in the administration violated Trumps own rules for ethical standards. In Executive Order 13770 Trump declared all federal appointees should pledge the following: If I was a registered lobbyist within the 2 years before the date of my appointment in addition to abiding by the limitations of paragraph 6 I will not for a period of 2 years after the date of my appointment participate in any particular matter on which I lobbied within the 2 years before the date of my appointment or participate in the specific issue area in which that particular matter falls. The Public Citizen attached a comprehensive report to each complaint which provided the full list of 36 individuals who were suspected to have violated Executive Order 13770. (  487.  March 22 2018  Donald Trump may have stoked a trade war with China by imposing tariffs on up to $60 billion worth of Chinese goods. While Chinas theft of American intellectual property has long struck economists as a serious problem in the economic relationship between the two world powers many economists viewed Trumps decision to impose tariffs on Chinese goods as a poor strategy for addressing the issue. Jason Furman an economist at Harvards Kennedy School of Government said Any good strategy has to include getting other countries on your side. If its the United States versus China were similar sized economies. If its the United States and the world versus China thats not something China can win.  488.  March 22 2018  Trump fired national security adviser General H.R. McMaster replacing him with former Fox News pundit John Bolton. McMaster and Trump had clashed frequently with McMaster telling Secretary of Defense James Mattis He treats me like a three-star rather than a coequal (McMaster is a four-star Marine Corps general). McMasters replacement John Bolton was in Trumps original consideration for the position but lost the spot because the president didnt like his mustache. The new hire would likely affect U.S. strategy for the upcoming diplomatic talks between the United States and North Korea as Bolton has long expressed hawkish views on North Korea. As recently as February 28 2018 Bolton wrote about the futility of conversation with North Korea favoring pre-emptive strike as the only viable option for the United States.  489.  March 25 2018  Ever since Trump was $1.6 billion in funding for his proposed border wall the president has privately argued for the construction funding to come from military budget. He then tweeted ""Because the $700 & $716 Billion gotten to rebuild our military many jobs are created and our military is again rich. Building a great border wall with drugs (poison) and enemy combatants pouring into our Country is all about national defense. Build WALL through M!  490.  March 26 2018  The Census Bureau announced it would include a question regarding citizenship status on the 2020 U.S. Census. The question hasnt been on the census since 1950. Critics of the move explained the question would discourage undocumented immigrants from responding to the census and thereby skew the population data significantly. The information gathered in the census has a bearing on everything from government policy to funding to boundaries for voting districts. Almost immediately the State of California sued the Trump administration over the constitutionality of the question. The Constitution states a census or actual enumeration must take place every 10 years and the enumeration must include the number of free persons. The State of California alleged this would include citizens and non-citizens alike.  491.  March 26 2018  Donald Trump kept in touch with Rob Porter after Porter left the White House amid credible allegations against him of domestic abuse from two of his ex-wives. In the final few weeks of March Trumps phone calls with Porter became increasingly frequent with some speculating Trump would bring Porter back to the White House soon. (March 25 2018)  492.  March 28 2018  The EPA sent an internal memo to staff describing a list of approved talking points downplaying the certainty of climate change. These included statements like ""While there has been extensive research and a host of published reports on climate change clear gaps remain in our understanding of the role of human activity and what we can do about it.

"Joe Biden said earlier this week that Wabtec's GE Transportation Erie Plant was ""thinking of shutting down."" That was news to Wabtec which called the facility ""an integral part of the business and our community.""  The employees of Local UE 506 have been through enough sleepless nights. Joe Biden in this political move thought he would hurt President Trump by casually mentioning without evidence that hundreds of Erie workers were going to lose their jobs. The hard-working people of Wabtec shouldnt be used as political pawns. Joe should apologize to Local UE 506 and retract his false statement.",political,Facebook

This is not an appeal for money. Im asking for your vote. There will be six of us running for three seats and you get three votes. Please consider using one of your votes for my candidacy. There are two other Democrats running and I would appreciate it if you considered voting for them as well. I believe that over 40 years working with the Tiffin City government serving on committees volunteering for activities conducting and analyzing surveys and heading up the Tiffin Park and Recreation Board for more than 30 years makes me a good candidate. In my professional life I have taught courses on local government and presented research on park and recreation policy and local elections. I was honored to be awarded Volunteer of the Year by the Ohio Park and Recreation Association and am a past President of the Ohio Economics and Political Science Association. My goal? Make Tiffin as good as possible a place to live work raise a family retire and play a lot of softball hike along the river and picnic with the family. An old friend once told me that those who stand still are falling behind. We have been successful as a community. I am proud to be a citizen of Tiffin. I see a bright future. But only if we dont let up dont circle the wagons and only protect what we have. I believe that there is much yet to accomplish in all areas of our community life. I want to see Tiffin as one shared neighborhood with affordable housing good paying jobs a common back yard called our parks and a start in life that knows no equal in America for all our children. As Satchel Paige once was reported as saying I dont look back. Someone may be gaining on me. I want to inspire as many people as I can to look forward.,political,Facebook
Defunding The Police And Vaccine Mandates What's really behind it  Mile High Houndog 17 hr ago Have you ever asked yourself how could anyone possibly believe that defunding the police is a good Idea or why do we need vaccine mandates if the vaccine works? I mean if it works how can someone infect you right? Or if it works so well that should be enough to convince people to take it. Either way a mandate isnt needed. What I believe is happening here is the government is weeding out people who are free thinkers and not blind followers which leaves people that arent free thinkers and will do whatever the Government says. Same thing in the military they are getting rid of soldiers that might question immoral or illegal orders. When you have blind followers who dont question you thats how you take over a country.  I have long said that for the Antichrist to rise and the mark to be instituted America has to be taken down. Not by war but from the inside and that is exactly what I see happening right now. Kudos to all the people including law enforcement who are sacrificing their jobs to do what is right. However that also means that there is no one left in those jobs that will stand up for us. It leaves only the loyal in power and that is a very scary scenario.,political,Facebook
PASS Parents and Friends  (Dan here.)  This weekend our three high schools will graduate 456 amazing young adults. As the father of one such graduate I could go on and on about how proud we are of them how much they achieved in difficult circumstances etc. but before I do that maybe I should say something we probably ought to say more here. Id like to thank the community that has paid for my daughters education. Some have done so willingly and some reluctantly but everyone who has owned a home or property in the county in the last 13 years contributed and I am grateful.  I know that for some people in some years paying local taxes is not painless and I know that to some extent local spending for education competes with local spending for public safety social services parks and rec and other important things. For most of the 13 years my daughter has been a student the people of this community have chosen to make education a priority because most people understand how important it is. So I think I speak for a lot of parents of graduating seniors when I thank this community for the sacrifices it has made to prepare these 456 people for life as an adult.  Ill show my gratitude by supporting the education of your kids and their kids and the kids who will someday become your mayors and county officials; your deputies and teachers; your doctors and lawyers; your clergy and perhaps the nurses aide who attends you in the retirement home in the last years of your life. Thats how it works. It may be a clich but investment in education is investment in the future.  To the Class of 2021 this community is so proud of all youve achieved particularly given the obstacles you have faced. The pandemic cost you the spring of your junior year and part of the fall of your senior year before a gradual return to something approaching normal. But with remote hybrid and in-person learning truncated sports seasons improvised art programs etc. you have managed to have something almost resembling a normal senior year culminating in graduation this weekend; you should be proud of yourselves.  Some of you will leave us for college; some will use junior college as a pathway to university or a career. Some of you will enter trades (perhaps because of training you received at Triplett) and some will take other jobs either here or elsewhere. Many of you  probably most of you  will go away for a time but we hope some of you will come back and it falls to us to create an economy worth coming back to. Wherever your life takes you I hope you remember where you came from and share some pride in --- and gratitude toward  the community that supported your education.  Dan,political,Facebook
If Americans ever understand the threat a third party has to the status quo we would have a lot more people voting for them. The reason the Ds and Rs try so hard to keep third parties silenced and out of races is not a matter of trying to keep people from having an option as it would take away the biggest bullet in their guns.  Both parties have switched gears now days from trying to make you like them enough to vote for them to trying to demonize the other party enough for you to vote against the other party. By default that forces you to vote for their party or just depress the vote. If a third party became a viable option they can no longer count on you to vote for them when you vote against the other party. That scares them it lessens their control.  We see this fearmongering every day from both parties. From the right it is stuff like if the Ds win they will take your guns or take your jobs by giving them to illegals. From the left it is if you vote Rs it means you are racist or want to keep the poor man down it is making you the target of cancel culture.  You want the hate to stop? Vote third party take their power away and make them earn your vote.  To support my thoughts this is the amount spent in my district for the MN-07 US Congressional seat (full disclosure I am running for this seat in 2022). As you can see the amount spent attacking is almost double what was spent supporting to include the candidates own campaign contribution. That is a lot more money spent on being against someone than for their candidate.  Source is from  $5447513 spent by both campaigns combined Outside money spent: $ 14141 493. $13035283 of which is from PACs directly connected to either party or their leadership. Money spent from outside sources in support of candidate or party $1144628 Money spent from outside sources against a candidate or party $12996865  Just something to think about. When you are thinking about it also consider how often in the last two presidential elections you heard that a vote for the third party was a vote for one parties opponent? Where do you think those talking points came from? #unleashthebullondc #runningofthebullinmn7,political,Facebook

"A CONSPIRACY THEORY D This is part of a series I have been writing on the subject there is much more I am still writing and will post some links in the comments Democrat or Republican we all need to open our our eyes.  Let's try this again. I am afraid to say what is in mind  not really afraid to say it but I fear where we are and where we are going and the future unless we stop and come to our senses quick looks scary.  We have an old tradition in this countrywhen we want to bring freedom and democracy to a foreign land we do one of two things we invade the country topple the regime and find some sellouts to replace the local government or we send arms to some disgruntled faction or two or three to start a civil war let their people destroy the country and we help whoever is the biggest traitor that will sell out the country to us.  The fact is that in a civil war there are no winning sides whoever comes up on top ( a civil war can last generations even) has to make a deal with an outsider or some super rich entity (ies) to maintain power and to establish controls. The super rich are not affected by the war itself in most inst6they may just go outside the war area ( even overseas) and come back later to assume power or control rebuilding effort and thus profit. In modern times the foriegn investment is stopped jobs and industries are lost poverty and misery spreads in all directions and for all sides.  If an entity or a power wanted to destroy the United States of course starting a civil war here would be the best way to destroy the nation its power and economy also. Let us assume that their is a ""cabal"" that is bent on destroying the country and taking control to destroy democracy and and set up autocratic regime todaybwould a good day since we are ready and willing to do it to ourselves. And how convenient if that power was to control parts of the government and the political apparatus already.  The two sides in the country today left and the right are willing to do it the right apparently thinks they have more guns so they will have the upper hand as most of the police and much of the military has already been brainwashed by their side and will be willing to kill for their purpose. They have been convinced that they are on the right side of history and they are sure to win the power. Of course the powers that be  the ones that are aiming to destroy democracy and and ruin the country have already a leader in place to do their bidding to call his followers to arms and to do the dirty work of encouraging civil strife.  More to follow  M. N. R.  12 OCTOBER 2020  CRISIS  An incident or an occasion that causes and brings about a lasting change in a person or even a society. That change once again depends upon the knowledge and the reasoning ability of the person or the society as a whole. The reasoning ability here depends upon education and also upon upbringing nature and nurture as they say. The same instant that will cause one to get motivated and work hard and get an education or such to get ahead could cause another to rob a store join a gang become a hooker or even join a church.  M. N. R.  12 OCTOBER 2020  VICTIMS  Once one has reached majority and claims maturity all choices are deliberate and all consequences always predicted.  If a baby is molested or a child is abused they have no control over the situation but when a person of age abuses alcohol or drugs drives drunk robs or kills drops out of school and has babies they can't afford they are not victims they know what they are doing and should be held responsible.  M. N. R.  That the democracy and the country itself is facing ruin regardless of who wins on the 3rd of November while both sides bicker about the supreme court nomination or the COVID-19 crisis we have bigger issues that need immediate attention. But we have been deliberately mislead. The plan is being worked by both sides to keep the population occupied with trash. I had warned about the militia plans and the infiltration of police and the military. I have written about the BLM and their misguided focus on the police brutality only. If there is a conspiracy it is about keeping the population confused and at each other's throat instead of solving problems. I wrote back in February how COVID-19 will impact everything we know about life from work to education and food  no one is talking about the new realities not in a major way and the public still has no idea what the new world will look like in a couple of years.  While a low level civil war or at least unrest is a real possibility regardless of who wins #republican side is not even trying to promote calm and peace. We will all pay for it. If Trump wins and igive him an 80% chance his followers may go to ""weapons free"" anyway.  Is it the conspiracy of the elite to start a civil war and destroy the democracy and install an autocratic regime. If I were betting I'd say that this the plan. A conspiracy right in your face and you are a willing participant. Only you lose is by winning. I am by no means done here do come back there is a lot more to this  M. N.

It has been said if we do not learn from history we are bound to repeat it. East Milton is now being eyed as the next new growth sector in this county. We have a lot to offer with the large land tracts and three main corridors Interstate 10 Hwy 87 and Hwy 90 which will be a better road once it gets four laned into town. Until then we will just have to suffer through the three traffic jams per day If we do not get out in front this growth this will be just another disorganized congested part of the County There is current evidence we are not looking ahead can someone explain why the county gave away 15 acres to a college not based in Santa Rosa Co to put in a truck driving training school NEXT to a truck driving training school we already have How about setting up a health care facility? We have high risk industrial jobs commercial construction jobs 3 jails a sports complex equestrian complex hunting properties not to mention the high traffic congestion 3 times a day 5 days a week 8am 11am and 4pm and Im sure other high-risk exposure that is escaping my mind at this moment...  So tell me... what do you think about the idea of building a walk in medical facility in East Milton?,political,Facebook
"My name is Drew King and I am running as a Democrat for the Illinois State House of Representatives. As a life-long resident of Illinois husband father of two dogs and proud member of the Palatine community I look forward to serving my constituents.  My upbringing in Illinois consisted of a one-income working family with a stay-at-home mom where my parents instilled ethics morals and values in me.  I grew up with my mother taking care of my sister and me while my father worked hard to provide us everything he could. We lived paycheck-to-paycheck and that made it hard at times. I remember the sound of bill collectors calling our home at all hours and I saw my family's vehicles be repossessed. No matter how hard things were my parents felt it was important for their children to receive a good education and instill values of morals and ethics which I still hold true to this day.  I also learned how fragile financial security is and that things need to change and I am confident in saying that that we need a lot more of ""up"" in Illinois and it's time for a change.  What do I mean by up?  It means that instead of looking down at how our State is being run we need to look up - we need to look forward to what can be achieved and make the necessary changes to work together Democrats and Republicans alike to have a more prosperous State.  At 16 years of age I began to work part time jobs to help my parents make ends meet. This showed me the importance of working together as a family toward a common goal. I am the first person in my family to not only go to college but graduate.  Later in life I became a self-taught businessman working in Information Technology with Teams both in the States and Internationally in the UK and India. Throughout my career I have never given up on the working class. To this day I value hard work determination and take pride in what Ive helped others to accomplish as well as what I have been able to accomplish myself.  Today we find ourselves in turbulent financial times during which many people have had to take pay cuts been furloughed or even worse lost their jobs. There needs to be a stronger focus on helping our neighbors put food on their table and be able to afford to pay their rent or mortgage.  As CDC Guidelines are relaxing there are still working-class families that have not been able to afford to get back to work even with Federal Government funds due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Rising childcare costs healthcare costs and low wages make it difficult.  I support programs that will bring more jobs  for example having more infrastructure projects in the greater Palatine Arlington Heights Prospect Heights and Rolling Meadows areas. The biggest way for job creation is through job training and job retainment programs which increase the availability of jobs and address changes in the knowledge required for the evolving workforce.  In our District we need to move towards vocational training which is already on an upswing. School District 211 for example has an award-winning nationally recognized program for vocational education but we need to do more. We need to make community colleges free for those 16+ that have graduated from High School. Harper College currently offers programs to ensure that education is accessible and affordable so that people can improve their education and job skills but we need to do more.  I will focus on the Economy and making Education affordable and I will also concentrate on Womens Rights and affordable Healthcare in the State but most importantly this District.  I plan to host health fairs twice a year where one will concentrate on Womens Health with speakers from local Healthcare providers and a second where I will work with local organizations to offer free drive-up STI testing drives for those 14- to 28-year-olds. Affordable and accessible healthcare is important to me.  A focus that I have is on helping the marginalized feel empowered to make strong confident decisions to be successful in life.  It is this importance of social equality to where I bring my life experience towards helping others hold themselves accountable and responsible in the areas in life which can be controlled through their own abilities and talents and work on identifying areas out of their control to try and find methods to take back that control.  As a political moderate I would oppose political changes which would result in a significant shift of society strongly to either the left or the right.  I also understand how the LGBTQ African American Asian American Hispanic-American and other marginalized communities feel disenfranchised and vulnerable because these groups are statistically less likely to be in full-time employment and much more likely to face barriers in accessing employment have less opportunities for employment or have to leave a job due to discrimination.  To that end a big focus on my campaign and my hope for our area in general is improving racial relations. There has been a lot of tension particularly in the last year or so during the pandemic revolving around race.  From George Floyds death to anti-Asian comments regarding the origins of the pandemic the crisis at our Southern Border and more I believe it is in our collective best interests to better improve these relations in this district Illinois and across the country.  There is still work to be had so that these marginalized groups of people have the basic rights of everyone around them.  I support Unions. This area of the State is known for being Union-friendly because we know the stability a Union provides for wages and benefits that help bring people out of poverty.  I will advocate for policies that benefit our District and State in a bipartisan consensus rather than having conflict with political opponents acting as a check and balance on legislation that I feel is too far to the right or too far to the left on the political spectrum.  If elected the day I arrive in Springfield I will collaborate with freshmen and incumbent Representatives to propose legislation to build policy proposals into law.  Thank you and I would be humbled to receive your vote!  #District54 #KingForIL54 #BDrewKing #Democrat",political,Facebook
Yuma County is currently faced with a challenging economic issue. Over the last several years our tax revenue has taken quite a hit due to the loss of natural gas production in our area. While the commissioners are not responsible for this they are responsible for having an innovative approach to attract positive and sustainable businesses to the area.  This economic crisis affects every other area of our county. One of the biggest concerns that I hear from voters is the issues of our county roads. Many need to be rebuilt and we need to make sure that our employees have the training to accomplish this. Additionally we need the resources to retain these employees. There would be little value in providing the best training the best people only for them to take our assets elsewhere. We need to give our employees every reason to stay with us.  It has been said that people dont leave jobs; they leave bosses. In addition to competitive salaries we need to enact proven management skills. We need to formulate tangible plans that will not only work for us but will inspire the faith of our employees and our citizens. This wont be easy. Yuma County is full of moving parts that all have to be considered as we establish a plan for the future.  Over the last 30 years I have gained the necessary experience to communicate effectively with our employees and constituents and I have what it takes to build those relationships that will set us on an upward economic path. Its more than a vision. Its more than a plan. Its a reality and its attainable.  Scott Weaver: Your District 2 Yuma County Commissioner,political,Facebook
What does economic development mean to you?  When I used to hear economic development I always shifted my thoughts to business. Whether it was attracting promoting or growing it was always about business. After spending time speaking with hundreds of Mattoon residents researching successful cities and asking the right questions Ive learned that economic development is much more.  Economic development is a plan. Economic development is a goal. Economic development is a necessity.  So what does economic development mean to me? It is improving the overall economic and social aspects of our community. It is improving our infrastructure parks playgrounds and more. It is expanding recreational opportunities for all ages. It is expanding services to our elderly. It is recruiting good paying jobs that employ our local employers and attract workers from other communities. Its reducing crime and getting people who are struggling with drug addictions off the streets and into programs. Its promoting new residential construction and attracting families to live and grow in Mattoon.  It is getting the right people in the right spots to formulate short and long term planning to achieve our goals.  Remember to vote for Trent Seiler. #1OnTheBallot #1Choice,political,Facebook
Investing in Nixa's future!  We all may have other things on our minds as we head into fall (back-to-school Friday night football or an upcoming election) but there is nothing like a good annual budget conversation to get our focus back to the critical issues in our community. Over the last 10 years City Council has worked hard to put Nixa in a solid financial position. Our careful planning helped the municipal government be able to navigate the financial challenges presented by the pandemic and to be ready to grow as we move forward. One of the key elements of our plan has been an over 80% reduction in the City's debt since 2011 - from $23.3 million in 2011 to only $4 million at the end of 2020. City Council has also invested in growing our local economy. Without raising Nixas sales tax rate at all in the last decade Nixa has seen a 65% increase in our general sales tax revenue over these same 10 years which proves stronger total sales by businesses located inside our city limits. In fact our local businesses have shown collective sales growth each year since 2010 including a 14% increase in 2020 and 12% increase so far in 2021. The biggest ticket items this tax revenue pays for are police and streets. These good numbers dont even take into account the addition of the local Use Tax approved by Nixa voters in 2018. The Use Tax was not a new tax nor an increase to the Sales Tax. Rather the Use Tax extended the same city sales tax rate (1.5%) so that it now also applies to purchases made from the giant online stores just as it always has for brick-and-mortar stores here in town. This finally put local businesses on a level playing field as they compete against those giant online stores which used to have an unfair price advantage because they didnt have to charge local sales tax (despite the fact their delivery trucks use our city streets and our police had to investigate if packages were stolen from porches). Now as the pandemics financial repercussions have cut key revenue streams (such as the interest we earn on money in the bank) thanks to that 2018 vote the Use Tax revenue has balanced out those losses. Despite the rapid growth of our citys population (over 4200 new residents since 2010) our slow-but-steady revenue growth and restraint in spending have allowed us to keep up with the increased costs needed to make sure the city doesnt sacrifice the quality of our public services as we stretch to serve more people than ever. We didnt just keep up we also made investments to improve existing services and fully staff the Nixa Police Department. On top of that we even saved some money for future park improvements as well as economic development projects aimed at helping local businesses succeed so they can bring more good jobs to Nixa. Along with the funding provided by the American Rescue Plan for local governments Nixa has never been in a better position financially. This year I will work with Council to utilize these resources to invest in Nixa's future. Some projects under consideration include major park upgrades funding regional water and wastewater infrastructure projects allowing for continual improvement of our police department and investing in technology and automation - all of which will reinforce Nixas reputation as one of the most innovative cities in Missouri. If you are interested in learning more about these plans or want to be part of the City's budget process I hope to see you at a council meeting this fall.,political,Facebook
When I learned this morning that today we have 80 routes impacting 38 schools without bus service and that many of the drivers at Annapolis Bus Company are continuing to stay home I decided that weve done enough talking. Transportation is a fundamental obligation of Anne Arundel County Public Schools and it must be provided.  From Governor Hogan down to the drivers and everyone in between there is agreement that we will only solve this problem by providing drivers with livable wages. Weve talked hiring bonuses retention bonuses and higher hourly wages. Weve talked AACPS American Rescue Plan (ARP) dollars county ARP dollars and future county budgets.  The next step is that AACPS must put a proposal on the table. Thats what will give drivers hope that conditions will improve and inspire others to apply for those jobs.  Thats what I said at todays press briefing and thats what I hoped to say at todays Board of Education meeting. I felt that it was important for the board the whole board in open session to hear that my administration is committed to supporting a plan but that we need one - now.  My request to speak was denied. AACPS attorneys said it would need to be in closed session because it involves contracts. I said it needed to be public because the public is paying the price.

The Left likes to attack fossil fuels with false statements. It started in the 1970s with foolish scare tactics that we were running out of oil. To the contrary oil and gas is still one of the cheapest and most widespread forms of energy available namely due to American ingenuity and the policies of the Trump Administration. We as a nation are an exporter of oil a fact which still seems to be inconceivable to those who oppose sound energy policy.  But facts do not seem to matter to the Left. Neither the enormous availability of fossil fuels nor the fact that oil and gas produces good-paying jobs nor the fact that oil and gas is necessary to our functioning as a society seem to matter. It is time to stand up to the harmful measures this Administration plans to implement and say NO to their efforts to take us backwards.,political,Facebook
A message to the people of Cocke County - especially to those affected by the loss of Conagra:  I know what you are going through...the worry the stress the uncertainty. I know because I've been through it too.  When Armstrong Cabinets of Morristown shut down in 2003 I had a wife three small kids and no idea how I was going to support them. I mowed yards to pay the mortgage. I stayed awake nights praying to God for help and guidance. It was one of the toughest times our family ever experienced.  However next year's elections go I promise you this: I will not rest until you get help. I will not waiver in the fight to bring jobs here to replace the ones we have lost with something better. I will not give up on our county. I will not give up on you. I will always have your back. You have my word on this.  This too shall pass. Good times will come again. We will get through this together. May God bless and keep you and your families.,political,Facebook

I work to deliver for you and our district. On education: During the pandemic I supported funding 100% of the per-student formula which is the states contribution to local schools regardless of virtual or in-person instruction. And in the last session I also supported adding $763 million to public education which was the largest K-12 investment in Indiana history. Also 94% of Indiana teachers received an average raise of $2160 per teacher in 2019.  On quality-of-life issues: I supported doubling the penalties for those irritating robocalls you get. So while my opponent has her campaign text you on your cellphone I have always done the hard work since 2015. On jobs. The economy. COVID-19. Education. Healthcare. Energy. Life. And constitutional issues. For District 62 and the great Hoosier state.  Vote on or before Nov. 3.  Thanks Jeff.,political,Facebook
(((Homeless Plan for Torrance))) We need an Anti Camping Ordinance to go along with building shelters and providing services. One without the other will not work. The vast majority of those chronically homeless are refusing help. In Torrance according the TPD Community Lead Officer (CLO) more than 90% of those approached have refused help and those that do accept help only last a few days before going back on the streets where they can drink shoot up drugs and not have a curfew. The streets of Torrance should be off limits. I am tired of being told that we need to have compassion and let these individuals live the way they want. I say NO. No more setting up camp and taking over bus stops. No more shooting up and drinking in public. No more trash being left behind for all of us to pick up. No more getting yelled at when you refuse to give out money. No more defecating and urinating in public. The real issue with homelessness starts off with identifying the root of the problem. It's not just affordable housing it's drug addiction alcoholism and mental health issues going untreated. The ones that are financially homeless are the low hanging fruit and are typically accepting help. Those are the ones that have been displaced by losing their jobs their home and many times their family. The rest need to be given some tough love and pushed into shelters where they can receive the help they need. Three options. One accept the help. Two keep moving and leave the Torrance area. And three get ticketed and possibly arrested if you don't accept help or leave Torrance. PERIOD. My plan will include military style tents and cots tiny homes that cost about $5000 each a safe parking area showers on trailers daily meals delivered and all the assistance they may need for getting back on their feet including mental health services. The Martin v. Boise ruling has given us guidelines we need to follow. I am all in on helping 100% of the homeless but they all need to be removed from the streets. If we don't want to turn into Venice or DTLA then we need to build enough shelters and safe parking areas to accommodate the 322 homeless in Torrance but under no circumstances will the streets be an option. The humane thing to do is to push these individuals into getting help. But without an Anti Camping Ordinance we will just waste tax payers money and never really get rid of the homeless off our streets. The homeless numbers have gone up 300% in the last four years here in Torrance. Don't think the problem is going away by itself. Since the June 4 2019 Torrance City Council Meeting I have been pushing city hall to come up with a homeless plan. Back then the numbers were much lower. As time goes on the issue is just going to get harder to fix. I want Torrance to be a Clean an Safe city. I will never stop fighting to achieve this. Thank you Aurelio Mattucci,political,Facebook
Hey Everyone!  Here are the questions the Republican Eagle asked of all City Council Candidates along with my answers in case you missed seeing them in the paper.  What compelled you to run for the City Council?  I plan to be a strong advocate for the citizens of Ward 2. I share my neighbors concerns that taxes and spending need to be brought under control. I am committed to working with other Council Members for a budget we can all support that eliminates unneeded spending and lowers taxes. I want to maintain our professional police and fire protection. In these times there is nothing more important than the health and security of our citizens.  What local issues are you passionate about?  Lower taxes and less spending. Average working families are facing fear for their health and uncertainty regarding their finances. The city has the power to remove some of the burden. I want voters to know that I understand the importance of keeping taxes low and spending their money sensibly. When the big-money spending projects come up for a vote on the City Council I will vote with the people.  Which issues would you address first if elected?  The budget taxes and strong public safety. It is not enough that my opponent votes no on a budget that passes anyway. I will use the budget workshop meetings as a chance to make changes toward a slimmer budget that earns my yes vote. I will begin by building trust with the other council members by carrying my share of the responsibilities. I will then work with them for meaningful budget reform by actively contributing to real solutions all can support. I will make sure our professional police and fire protection have the tools and additional training they need to keep us safe in these challenging times.  What if anything would you change about the city of Red Wing?  There have been past unsuccessful attempts at filling our downtown storefronts through meetings and special groups. What is needed now is an entirely new approach that includes lobbying for state revitalization funds and an action plan that is workable along with city leaders who follow through to get it done. I will get to work on this in January of 2021. Red Wing currently has plans for cruise ships to dock here in 2021 and 22. I will focus on making our downtown a place they want to visit again and again. I plan to secure long-term contracts with the cruise companies that will give local business owners confidence to invest in our downtown.  What have you done to prepare for elected office?  Most importantly I have been listening to residents at every opportunity - the gas station the grocery store as well as planned events. I have also spoken with council members in other communities past and present members of the Red Wing City Council and local business and community leaders to get perspective on what has and has not worked in the past. I have been researching ways to attract companies that offer good jobs and will make a major property tax contribution. My research is also directed toward attracting the affordable housing we need for our families and seniors. Some downtown buildings still have not been able to remodel their second floor into housing. If the city focused on a solution we could provide more housing and help revitalize downtown at the same time.  What do you think makes you qualified for the role?  As a lifelong resident who has followed local government closely I understand the hard choices facing residents. I will bring new ideas energy and a fresh approach anchored in the solid bedrock of our shared community values of fairness mutual respect and individual responsibility. We inherited a beautiful city in an unsurpassed natural setting filled with people who genuinely care. My votes on the City Council will reflect their views and their values. I am dedicated to maintaining the small town we love and making Red Wing an affordable place to raise a family build a business and retire comfortably.  How do you plan to involve residents in your decision-making process?  I will actively seek input from citizens then act on their suggestions. I will attend civic meetings of all types to interact with residents on issues they care most deeply about. I will take the time to listen no matter where I am. Then I will take those ideas to the City Council. I will provide the kind of representation that comes from sincerely listening to the people. I am committed to ensuring that every citizen feels their voice has been heard. People can call me at home: 651-212-6244 or email me: andyklitzke1@gmail.com. A call or email to me will always get a response.,political,Facebook
My name is Jill Gumble and I'm asking for your vote in becoming the city council representative for the North West district.  I moved to Hutchinson in 1996 and married Mitch Gumble in 1997. We have 3 grown children and 4 grandchildren. In 1997 I began my real estate career with Astle Realty now known as Plaza Astle Realty Inc. and worked for 15 years with Realty Executives 4Results. In 2000 my husband and I started a local retail furniture and appliance store and we are still in business today. In 2002 we purchased our first rental property and currently own numerous quality affordable rentals throughout Hutchinson.  I have served with the following organizations and boards: I was an Ambassador with the Chamber of Commerce I served on the Board of Directors for the Hutchinson Board of Realtors I was involved in the development of the City of Hutchinson Landlord/Tenant handbook and I'm currently the President of the Central Kansas Landlords Association.  While my background is heavy in housing and real estate I also fully understand the financial challenges a new business faces when considering opening their doors. The cost of a new mortgage insurance inventory and labor can become overwhelming. But when faced with Hutchinson's restrictive building codes and requirements high property taxes and the additional expense of the Storm Water Utility fees ....the obstacles become burdensome and less cost effective. The numerous vacant commercial properties in our town are a direct reflection of the obstacles being too much for a new business to budget and justify. Our city MUST become more welcoming and supportive of any individual or company wanting to invest their money into our community.  My main focus is to partner with The Chamber of Commerce to bring in new business create new jobs to creates new sources of revenue for our city. Additionally we must continue to make allowances for a strong and viable infrastructure. Core services must be protected and funded FIRST when establishing our city's budget. This includes making sure our first responders have the supplies and resources they need to work safely and effectively.  I've invested my money and efforts into the city of Hutchinson. And I believe in Hutchinson's abilities to become a stronger community. It's time to make Hutchinson strong again. And with a stronger economy we will build a stronger community.  I thank you for your consideration and would greatly appreciate your support along with your vote in November.,political,Facebook
The mysterious interview  If you live in the Westside Flood District you received a three-page soliloquy from Lynn Baker stating: there is misinformation hypocrisy and lies about Scott Lankford and Kelly Manzer. He never once said what those lies were.  My first thoughts upon reading were how he went back and forth spelling Scotts last name wrong the anonymous interviewer (Why would this person not want their name on their work?) and he used the exact same name of my Facebook and the same font for his letterhead. My guess is that my page has garnered so much support he is trying to cash in on it.  I'm only addressing a few things here. Please go read my earlier posts for all the information.  Lynns Letter: I tried to post factual information with supporting documents on the Putnam Facebook Campaign Page but was blocked.... you could call them lies or at the least wild distortions of truth.  a. LYNN BAKER DOES NOT HAVE A FACEBOOK PAGE. HIS WIFE SANDRA BAKER; AKA S CLARK.ERIKSON DOES. I DID BLOCK HER FOR A FEW DAYS. SOME OF MY FOLLOWERS THOUGHT HER HYSTERICS AND CONSTANT CONDESCENSION HELPED ME WITH MY CAUSE TO SHOW VOTERS WHY THEY SHOULD VOTE FOR PUTNAM AND FAIRHURST SO I UNBLOCKED HER. SHE HASNT BEEN BACK. PROBABLY UNDER ADVICE OF HER HUBAND/LEGAL COUNCIL. I HAVE NO DOUBT SHE TROLLS MY PAGE EVERY DAY.  b. HE WENT TO THE TIME AND EXPENSE TO MAIL EVERYONE IN THE DISTRICT WHY DIDNT HE SAY WHAT THE LIES ARE? WHY DIDNT HE LIST ANY SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS IN HIS LETTER?  Lynns letter: I told her (Nicky Putnam) clearly that I was the attorney for the district not any individual person or commissioner.  a. THIS IS THE FOURTH (4TH) LETTER/POST CARD FROM THE BAKER HOUSEHOLD SUPPORTING KELLY MANZER AND SCOTT LANKFORD  b. WITH OVER 600 PROPERTIES IN THE FLOOD DISTRICT THE BAKERS HAVE SPENT A LOT OF MONEY SUPPORTING CANDIDATES THAT VOTE HIM THE BIG PAY RAISES HE DESIRES.  Lynns letter: they (Putnam and Fairhurst supporters) have created wild lies about the performance and actions of commissioners Lankford and Manzer:  a. WHAT LIES? AGAIN JUST WILD ACCUATIONS.  Lynns letter: They (supporters of Putnam and Fairhurst) have prevented Lankford and Manzer from doing their job.  a. HOW DID WE DO THAT? LYNN DID NOT PROVIDE ONE SINGLE EXAMPLE.  Lynns letter: Nicky supporters have already promised another lawsuit if she loses. That is why the commissioners increased next years budget line item for legal assistance:  a. CHUCK ROGERS VOTED NO TO THE 300% increase. KELLY MANZER AND SCOTT LANKFORD VOTED YES AND NOW YOU ARE GETTING CARDS AND LETTERS FROM THE BAKERS SUPPORTING SCOTT AND KELLY.  b. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A DISCUSSION OF ANOTHER LAWSUIT. PLEASE PROVIDE AN EXAMPLE OF WHEN AND WHERE YOU HEARD THIS.  c. NICKY PETITIONED THE COURT FOR A NEW ELECTION BECAUSE THE FIRST ONE WAS DONE WRONG. A FACT THE COUNTY READILY ADMITTED BUT WOULDNT DO ANYTHING ABOUT. NICKY IS THE ONLY PERSON THAT FOUGHT FOR US PEOPLE IN THE DISTRICT AND OUR RIGHT TO VOTE.  Lynns letter: In reality we need younger people or other people to step up and make difference in the way leaders govern.  a. THEY ARENT SUPPOSE TO LEAD OR GOVERN. THEIR JOB IS TO OPERATE AND MAINTAIN THE LEVEE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RULES SET OUT BY THE ARMY CORP OF ENGINEERS. THEIR JOB DESCRIPTION IS WRITTEN OUT IN THE OWNERS AND OPERATORS MANUAL. THEY ANSWER TO THE STATE OF MT 8TH JUDICIAL DISTRICT COURT. THEY LITERALLY ARE SUPPOSE TO JUST DO THE WORK AND REPORT BACK.  Lynns letter: They want to operate in the manner of 25 years ago:  a. NOTHING HAS CHANGED IN 25 YEARS (ACTUALLY 34 YEARS) BECAUSE THE CORP HASNT CHANGED ANYTHING. KELLY MANZER AND SCOTT LANKFORD (NO COMMISSIONER) HAS THE AUTHORITY TO CHANGE THAT. THEY ARE SUPPOSE TO DO THE WORK REQUIRED THEN ANSWER TO THE DISTRICT COURT. OUR LEVEE HAS MAINTAINED AND ACCEPTABLE STATUS FOR 34 YEAARS. THE FACT KELLY MANZER AND SCOTT LANKFORD THINK THEY CAN OR SHOULD CHANGE ANYTHING IS EXTREMELY WORRISOME. IF THEY DONT FOLLOW THE THE O & M (OWNERS AND OPERATORS MANUAL) WE WILL LOSE OUR CERTIFICATION.  b. KNOWLEDGE IS POWER. THE OLD GUARDS HAVE WATCHED OVER AND PROTECTED OUR PROPERTIES FOR MORE THAN 25 YEARS. KELLY MANZER AND SCOTT LANKFORD BOTH ANNOUNCED AT A MEETING THEY DO NOT HAVE TIME TO READ THE OWNER AND OPERATOR MANUAL (THEIR JOB DESCRIPTION) BECAUSE THEY HAVE FULL TIME JOBS. IF THEY DONT HAVE TIME TO INVEST IN THE LEVEE WHY ARE THEY RUNNING FOR THE POSITION? THIS ISNT A SIDE HUSTLE FOR NICKY PUTNAM FRED FAIRHURST OR CHUCK ROGERS. THIS IS THEIR FULL TIME JOB. THEY HAVE ALL LIVED THROUGH FLOODING. MAINTAING THE LEVEE IS THIER PASSION.  Please go read all my earlier posts. Vote for NICKY PUTNAM and FRED FAIRHURST,political,Facebook
THE 'CLOWN' IN THE WHITE HOUSE  The 'clown' in the White House has brokered two Middle East Peace Accords something that 70+ years of political intervention by countless previous administrations and endless wars failed to produce.  The 'clown' in the White House is the first president since Eisenhower who has NOT engaged us in a foreign war.  The 'clown' in the White House has received THREE nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize for his Middle East peace efforts and his dis-engagement from foreign wars.  The clown in the White House significantly improved the veterans' care by the VA which had been either ignored or ineffective under previous administrations.  The 'clown' in the White House has had the greatest impact on the economy in the last 40 years by bringing jobs back to the U.S. and lowering unemployment for the female black and latino populations of ANY other president. Ever.  The clown in the White House has exposed the deep widespread and long-standing corruption in the FBI the CIA the NSA and the Republican and Democratic parties.  The clown in the White House turned NATO around and had them start paying their dues.  The clown in the White House turned our relationship to the Chinese around brought hundreds of business back to the U.S. and revived the economy. Hello!  The clown in the White House has replaced the NAFTA disaster with a more equitable USMCA although he was told it could not be done.  The clown in the White House has accomplished the life-time appoints of two Supreme Court Justices and close to 300 Federal Judges.  The clown in the White House lowered your taxes and caused your stock market to move to record levels over 100 times which positively impacted the retirements of tens of millions of citizens.

The clown in the White House uncovered widespread pedophilia in the government and in Hollywood. And the clown in the White House is exposing world wide sex trafficking of minors and bringing children home to their families.  The clown in the White House has factually done more for the people of the U.S. in his first 47 months in political office than ANY OTHER politician has done in the past 47 years.  The clown in the White House WORKS FOR FREE and has lost well over 2 billion dollars of his own money in serving.  He has done ALL OF THIS AND MUCH MORE in the face of relentless undermining and opposition from people who are threatened because they know they are going to be exposed as the criminals that they are if he is re-elected.  I get it you don't like him. How special of you! He is serving you and ALL the American people. What are you doing -- besides denying his accomplishments calling him names and supporting self-centered power-hungry corrupt politicians?  Author unknown. Copied and Pasted,political,Facebook
WHY DO I RUN  Many of my friends asked me if I've lost my mind by getting involved in politics and I sometimes ask the same of myself. However I am deeply troubled by what appears to be a total lack of caring and common sense being shown by our current legislature.  By not expanding Medicaid our legislature has deprived hundreds of thousands of our fellow citizens access to healthcare resulting in thousands of preventable deaths from easily treated or preventable diseases and untold needless suffering.  Further by not expanding Medicaid our legislature has forfeited billions of our tax dollars which instead of being spent in North Carolina are being spent in other states who have expanded Medicaid.These funds would have resulted in tens of thousands of new jobs in North Carolina prevented the closure of several rural hospitals and the exodus of large numbers of physicians from many of our rural communities.  If elected I will stand lockstep with Gov. Cooper in demanding that we immediately expand Medicaid. I do this to see that hundreds of thousands of my fellow North Carolinians will get access to healthcare to create thousands of new jobs most of which will be high-paying to preserve rural hospitals and to expand rural healthcare for all who live in my district and similar ones throughout the state.,political,Facebook
"GREEN NEW DEAL  There is no universally understood definition of what ""the"" Green New Deal proposal is specifically. Broadly we understand it to be a government initiative to invest in jobs and infrastructures that will clean our environment and reduce carbon emissions. The term ""Green New Deal"" was first penned by Green Party activists decades ago and later co-opted by the Democratic Party as a title for several different legislative proposals that have been presented. First it is important to acknowledge that there is no one specific Green New Deal that we can all agree on as the reference point. There are many varying proposals initiatives and concepts identifying themselves as a Green New Deal. With that important distinction acknowledged I wholeheartedly support the general objectives and goals of most Green New Deals that have been proposed. Without necessarily having to proclaim support for an amorphous interpretation of ""THE"" Green New Deal I readily and willingly support any government initiatives that regulate actions that impact the environment that invest in infrastructure jobs and policies that will reduce carbon emissions reverse global warming and protect and clean our environment. Whether a comprehensive package some iteration of a Green New Deal can be passed or whether certain components must be passed individually in piecemeal as a Green Independent I support any and all efforts to improve our environment and protect it from further degradation. In addition to being an advocate for any proposal that is a benefit to our environment there are also some non-environmental topics included in some versions of a Green New Deal -- such as living wages and universal access to health care -- that I also support.",political,Facebook

Below is the speech I delivered at the Carthage Central School District Meet the Candidates Night this evening. Good evening Thank you Mr. Burker and the honors program for the opportunity to speak here this evening. For far too long our elected officials have followed the status quo and as a result District 7 is always last to receive our share of County tax revenue. County Route 47 is just one example as it took the Town opting out of snow removal for the County to finally do something about the deteriorating road conditions. This road deteriorated rapidly because of the trucks utilized in the construction of the Lewis County wind mills. Governments in Lewis County entered into agreements with the wind farms that required they pave the roads upon completion. This is why you saw all the fresh pavement in Lewis County. Our representatives failed to enter into a similar agreement and as a result it fell to the tax payers. District 7 is the Town of Champion West Carthage the Hamlets of Champion and Great Bend and the little section of the Town of Leray behind the Village of Black River. The County hasnt provided anything noticeable to district 7 in years. We need representation that is willing to challenge the Board and fight for our equal share of revenue. It shouldnt take the Town opting out of snow removal to get County roads repaired. We deserve our share of the taxes we pay and shouldnt have to hunt to find out where the money is going. It is taxation without representation. Until recently District 7 was paid $50000 to plow county roads out of a property tax levy collected of roughly $2000000. Aside from that what services have been received? We need change. We need a representative who is willing to stand up for district 7 and our needs. I do not believe that our current representative is the best path moving forward. As your District Legislator I can not guarantee results but I can guarantee I will be on the record advocating for you. I will be the advocate that district 7 currently lacks. When asked what will I do if elected to help the youth in our area as they grow into active citizens I want to assure you that I am always available transparent and eager to teach. I am supportive of the younger generation as valuable candidates for election to local offices. I am ecstatic that JD was elected to the town board. The multi-generational gap on the Town board is finally over. I am willing to mentor any youth interested in stepping forward and becoming an active member of the community. I was also asked what I think the youth should do to become more active in the community. I believe that community service is important. I enlisted in the Army to serve my country and now I serve as town councilman hopefully soon as County Legislator. The youth need to become involved in the community and give back. I serve on the  where there are many opportunities for the younger community members to serve. I am also a member of the   and . These organization could greatly benefit by a younger generation coming on board to serve as there is a multi-year generational gap between those in the organizations and our youth. The community is all about taking care of each other and we need our youth to step forward and take the reins in these organizations. People dont realize just what these organizations do for the area but they will understand quickly if these organizations cease to exist. They provide everything from scholarships food to those in need gifts around the holidays and offer community rooms for special events or just a place to socialize and build camaraderie with others in the community. They host winter coat drives and shoe drives charity dinners and events for locals facing difficult times. As the generational gap widens it becomes harder and harder for these organizations to do what they do. We need the youth to step forward and discover for themselves how great it feels to give back and just how important it is for our small community to do so. Another thing for the youth to remember is to buy local means to support local. We are all guilty of jumping on Amazon to save a buck or because its just so convenient. However when we do this we dont spend our money supporting a local business. A business that is not owned by a millionaire but one of our neighbors. Sometimes the extra dollar spent is what puts food on someones table. is a perfect example you might pay slightly more but you get locals who know you by name who help you locate what you need and as you leave the store you always walk out feeling just a bit better than you did when you went in. That experience makes the couple extra bucks worth it but it also ensures locals have jobs to support their own families. Could you go to Lowes or Amazon and find the item yourself at a cheaper price? Of course but if we do that too often it means local businesses close locals lose jobs and the area relies more and more on property taxes and social welfare programs in order to survive. Thank you for allowing me to speak tonight and for hosting this event. Remember the leaders that understood the importance of tonight for our future community leaders when you head to the voting booth. If they couldnt make an appearance for you this evening will they make an appearance for you when it means potentially going against the grain? Thank you   Richard Mushtare Faith Parks and Francis DiShaw your presence speaks volume for your character and desire to lead our youth into the future. This November vote Gump Running for You! End the status quo and help me bring District 7 and Champion into the future.,political,Facebook
