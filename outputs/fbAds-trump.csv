"THE LONG ARC OF RACISM  The insurrection by anti-government white nationalists on January 6th was 12 years in the making beginning with Obama's election in 2008.  Americans spent the beginning of the 2000s focusing their hatred on Muslims launching two ill-fated wars in an attempt to reassert its global dominance. As America's military might floundered in the Middle East its economy imploded after decades of stagnant wages conspicuous consumption and deregulation came home to roost. Then the unthinkable happened.  A Black man was elected president.  Racists rallied to the call.  Obama was surely not a legitimate president. He wasn't even a legitimate American!  Tea parties gathered decorum was cast aside (e.g. ""You lie!"" yelled at the State of the Union) and fragile white Americans were soon able to excuse their every failure and soothe every insecurity as the consequence of Obama's election.  The Republican party rallied the support of ""angry white men"" to help ""keep them in business"" and Donald Trump rode that wave of amorphous bigoted ignorant rage to the White House.  White nationalists had their president and he considered them ""very fine people."" The arc of American decay that Republicans often infer began with the Voting Rights Act and hastened thereafter had reached its nadir with Obama's election and Trump was finally making America great again (wink wink).  But his God-given presidency was about to be cut short by of all things Black voters in cities like Atlanta and Philadelphia who dared exercise the very rights that brought the cultural decline of America nearly 60 years ago.  Despite weeks of calling for violence Trump's white nationalist supporters were welcomed to Washington DC in a manner that stood in undeniably stark contrast to that which Black Lives Matter protesters received 6 months earlier. Where BLM were met by the National Guard in tactical gear on the steps of the Lincoln Monument Trump's racist insurrectionists were allowed to run wild all the way into the Capitol and onto the floor of the Senate.  Americans soothed themselves saying ""this isn't who were are!""  Yes it is.  It is who we have always been.  Angry.  Fragile.  Entitled.  Violent.  and  Racist.  Trump's defeat doesn't fix these problems or heal these wounds.  Black voters saved America from Trump.  Now it's time for white people to step up and save America from...white people.",political,Facebook

Republicans are raising hell because 13 members of Congress in their party voted for the infrastructure package. They tried through out Trumps presidency to get an infrastructure bill through Congress and were unsuccessful. In August 18 Republican Senators voted to move this bipartisan bill forward. Of course like any bipartisan bill there is always parts of it either party will complain about but that is what a compromise looks like. The Independence Party supports the Federal government spending money on infrastructure that is sorely needed and creates a foundation for our country to thrive upon. We do not however like the fact that a large portion of this bill is being paid for with borrowed money. Unfortunately that is the one thing both parties I like to call them Republicrats always seem to be able to agree upon. As far as the GOP members complaining about their fellow Republicans supporting something they have been trying to get done just shows how they will always put their part before country. I also include the radical far left Progressives who also held this bill up for months in the category of party before country. All of this points to the need for a third party with centrists beliefs.,political,Facebook
To all who care about their Country and the state of affairs in the United States  I am a Retired Military Officer Commissioned from Infantry Officer Candidate Candidate School Class 509 Fort Benning Georgia in 1968. I served 23 years as a Commissioned Officer and retired from the Military in 1989 to pursue other opportunities in the civilian sector. Considering how our country is currently being led by an incompetent President I pledge to support this Country and my fellow Officers who join me in publicizing the present danger of our current President Donald J. Trump. I also invite other citizens of the United States to speak up and join our protest and demand that the current President and his regime step down from their positions. In this regard I strongly support my fellow Officers who have collectively penned the letter below. If you agree with our concerns I request you copy and re-post this letter to your family and friends across our Country.  R. Scott Swingler Lieutenant Colonel U.S. Army Retired  The Letter  VOICES OF CONCERN FOR OUR IMPERILED DEMOCRACY  We the undersigned are former or retired army officers now in our seventies. We share a common bond having graduated from the U.S. Army Officer Candidate School at Ft. Benning Georgia in 1968. From there we served in the military in a variety of capacities wherever we were needed. As young men we were committed to defending Americas values our freedoms our democracy and our Constitution. Some of us made a career in the military but most of us went on to have productive careers back home in the civilian world. As a group we have diverse political views: Republicans Democrats Liberals and Conservatives. But we are all concerned Americans.  In the past few months our system of government has been increasingly under siege. Our nation has reached this critical point under the current administration of Donald J. Trump. Important voices have begun to speak out led by respected members of the highest military rank. We would like to join this chorus of alarm.  Our government structure with its co-equal branches is in jeopardy. Our judicial system is reeling. The FBI the CIA and the NSA are being mocked and belittled. Our Attorney Generals office is overtly politicized. Our State Department is being decimated. Where are the voices of outrage in Congress? The Senate is virtually mute.  We are concerned that our country is rapidly spinning toward a Presidency staffed by family members and cronies in which the only prerequisite is blind loyalty. The United States is withdrawing from the world enjoying little respect internationally. This cannot continue.  Quoting James Mattis a Marine Four Star General and former Secretary of Defense:  We know that we are better than the abuse of executive authorityWe must reject and hold accountable those in office who would make a mockery of our Constitution.  We honor the Generals courage and emphatically call on both chambers of Congress to follow his lead in defending our democracy and our Constitution. We urge all Americans to consider these ideals as you vote this Fall.  John F. Baxter III (1LT USA) A.C. (Budd) Mazurek (1LT USA) Mark T. Creaven (1LT USA) John F. McMackin Jr. (1LT USA) Larry W.

Last night voters sent several messages (plus add'l analysis):  1) Durham voters want change but not too fast. All the candidates (with maybe the exception of Sylvester Williams) supported the new non-violent Community Safety Department. But Durham said they want slower change on that front. No commitments but conditions based. Candidates promising that were victorious last night.  2) Putting in the work still matters. AJ Williams drew the Ward 3 race to a photo finish through hard work both during the election and his past work in the advocacy space.  3) Campaign messaging still matters. Both here and in VA we saw the strength of a good (or bad) campaign message. In Durham Elaine O'Neal's message of made/trained/ready to serve my hometown combined with her record of service translated into dominating a 7 person field. In VA we saw where the Dem trying to make the sweater vest wearing moderate appearing GOP candidate into Donald Trump reincarnate backfired.  4) A new council majority. The Ward 3 race was actually very important as it was the battle over the 4th vote. Now O'Neal will be leading a loose coalition of O'Neal/Freeman/Middleton/L Williams (they did not run as a ticket but did endorse each other).  5) End of an era. Ever since 2004 Mayor Steve Schewel has been in city and county leadership (first School Board the city council and now mayor). Before that he was an influential voice as the publisher of the IndyWeek local newspaper. That ends next month.,political,Facebook
Election day is Tuesday! We wanted to send out a final message to voters that may still be considering how they will use their THREE school board votes about what we think this election is and is not about.  This election IS NOT a referendum on our public schools -- we know that our schools do a good job without being perfect.  This election IS NOT about whether you send your children to public or private schools -- many members of our PAC have had children in private schools.  This election IS NOT about school levies -- not every member of our PAC has always supported every school levy and nothing about this election obligates you to support future school levies.  This election IS ABOUT one thing: Do we want unqualified Trump-supporting radical conservatives running our schools? Thats what is on the ballot on Tuesday.  You can think our public schools have problems and send your children to private schools and dislike our property tax rates and ALSO REALIZE that electing Rennert Lynn and Drake is not the solution. Electing them is likely to result in giveaways to private interests and is likely to make our schools worse. It won't fix anything.  In fact at the end of the day what this election is really about is keeping MAGA off of our school board.  On Tuesday we hope you will join us in using ALL THREE of your votes for three of Malia Lewis Jodi Sourini Dan Heintz and Mario Clopton-Zymler for Cleveland Heights-University Heights School Board.,political,Facebook
I need to ask you all for the greatest favor.  I am asking that if you do not see my name on your ballot for Tuesday Please write me in.  I do not believe the election results of 2020 are certifiable.  I do not think the election would be fair to be redone with the existing candidates.  I ask that I be considered a write in.  I will take the role for no salary as Mr. Trump did. I know how difficult this must be to read for so many reasons.  I can only do the new salary portion of us because Im relying on my businesses getting going.  Should this all work out somehow I promise that I will do my absolute best at giving 110% to the daily roles and responsibilities I will need to take over  My entire life was geared toward one goal and without a college education there doesnt seem like another pathway for me to D.C  Most of my apparent mania was because of this goal.  My long term objectives are pretty well laid out.  Affordable Housing Medicare for All Welfare Reform Initiate a war on Homelessness  Education Reform Social Security Overhaul  Transportation Railway and Infrastructure corrections and modifications  Implementation of high end internet security devices and software across the country to remove the risk of data privacy issues for both civilians and government.  I know all the questions you may have and why you may say how do you think you could be qualified  The only answer I have is I feel as if I were always going to end up right here.  I believe that we have a tremendous amount of work to do.  The world didnt quite catch up to us in Avi-tech? But the proximity blew me off my chair this last July.  I spent my 4th of July watching the supply chain issue begin. It has been heart wrenching to know that the world relies so heavily on tech however the big 4 corporations chose not to do more.  I see this as negligent at a level that is unreasonable.  Biometrics for logging onto the computer and the Internet have been around a long time and Im not quite sure this push didnt happen years ago.  #1dayatatime,political,Facebook

More and more cutting back of the larger social spending budget bill. First environmental and now needed benefits for elders critical paid family leave and family protection in general. At some point very close to now the progressives are going to say enough is enough and not vote for the flawed deeply cut bill just to satisfy 2 Senators.  As well the infrastructure bill without the critical larger social spending bill will just increase inequality and division. The infrastructure bill alone only feeds and maintains the current structural inequality and dysfunction of the present state of things.  The progressives need to take a stand here. Either pass both in their robust forms or pass neither. Then move more aggressively to pursue our social justice strategy. We need more backbone. Ill take my chances by striving for what is clearly fair and right rather than continue to accept growing inequality in the service of special interests.,political,Facebook

When you speak truthBe ready to be made fun of and even hated by family and friends.  Are you praying for knowledge and understanding?  Are you searching for TRUTH beyond 5 minutes of mainstream news on TV which is nothing more than an extension of the antichrist spirit and agenda?  You dont believe me? Keep watching with your own eyes and I pray the light of the glorious gospel shines the light of truth unto you  I sense very strongly that ""most"" people are completely oblivious to whats happening and will NOT understand until its too late.  Jeremiah 5:21 Hear now this O foolish people and without understanding; which have eyes and see not; which have ears and hear not:  Jesus saidAll these are the beginning of sorrows.

The supply chain problems we are having is directly attributed to the reaction to the economic downturn caused by the COVID pandemic. Our government generally stimulates the economy through three methods all of which causes the debt to rise. The first method is to cut taxes to put more money in the private economy. Trump and the GOP did this at a time that in my opinion the economy did not need stimulus. It did make the economy grow but disproportionately benefitted wealthier Americans. The second way the government stimulates the economy is by giving cash directly to Americans. This is a very effective way giving the economy a quick boost but also causes overheating and can lead to shortages and inflation. Both the previous administration and the current one did this which helped prevent a recession. Unfortunately the Democrats doubled down on direct infusion and gave money to parents of young children who are the most likely to use it to buy things. This has caused a huge demand for products manufactured in Asia at a time that the shipping industry hasnt fully recovered capacity. Basically the supply line crises is caused by an economic policy that worked to well. The biggest problem with all of this money going out to parents is it has enabled them to not work. All of this borrowed money is going straight to manufactured goods from Asia while our Service Economy is struggling with a labor shortage. The third way the government stimulates the economy is by spending it on public projects like the proposed infrastructure bill. This type of stimulus is a slower but more measured way for money to be injected into the economy. In addition it has the added benefit of building enduring investments that help maintain the economy in the future.,political,Facebook

"""The Psychology of Trump-Haters""  Whats happening in America right now shouldnt come as a surprise to anyone. It could be spotted from miles away!  As a psychologist watching the political back and forth in the USA over the past 5 years is pretty incredible. Seeing people say what theyve said behaved in the way theyve behaved and made the decisions theyve made has been interesting to watch. Its also illuminated a very clear truth.  The reason why Trump-haters hate Trump so much is not because they actually hate Trump the person. Because they dont even know him. Theyre definitely not protesting Trumps competence or political policies. Because well lets face it he did an incredible job with our economy protected the people inside the country with strong borders and won the respect of so many around the world. Allies felt supported. Enemies knew not to mess. Prospects knew to tread carefully. And he did it all so confidently unabashedly unapologetically. How attractive!  So the question remains if its not his personality and its not his policies what is it? Notice that people who have been critical of Trump tend to be very reactionary in their position. Its a highly emotional topic for them. It stirs up a lot. Interestingly the reaction has been so powerful and pervasive that it even has its own syndrome!  And therein lies the answer to this question. The people who have been so vehemently opposed to Trump are not really against Trump. Theyre upset at what Trump triggers deep inside them. That is what they're reacting to when they hear ""Trump."" Trump reminds many of the unprocessed anger they have towards authority figures in their lives. Maybe an angry father. Perhaps a controlling mother. Possibly an abusive boss. For many people the idea of Trump has woken (no pun intended) up tremendous emotional pain and psychological trauma that these people have not dealt with. And that they have not wanted to deal with.  Psychologically-speaking thats how we got here. Thats why so many picked Biden. I put it in quotes because they didnt really pick Biden. They just wanted to escape Trump. Or I should say the painful memories that Trump stirred up inside them. Was Trump opinionated? Of course he was. Was he outlandish in his delivery at times? Absolutely. Did he come across as arrogant and egotistical at points? Without question. Its all true!!!  But objectively that is what you want in a President of the USA. That is what you want from your Commander in Chief. That is what you want from the guy whos sole responsibility and duty is to go up to bat for you. You want someone who will unabashedly stand up for you guard you and protect your interests with everything hes got when it comes down to the wire.  The truth is to guard and protect properly sometimes you have to be bold. You have be direct. You have to be aggressive. Otherwise some wont hear you. They will not respect you. They will manipulate you. And they will walk all over you.  To the Trump haters I feel for you. Living this way must be complete emotional hell. Because youre always on the run. Your life is driven by fear. You make decisions that are based in anxiety and avoidance. Youre constantly looking to make choices not that you necessarily personally believe in but because they are less triggering. And unfortunately sometimes it leads to this. The truth about Biden is clear to everyone now. At least it should be. He was never fit to be a leader in this capacity. The writing was on the wall from the very beginning. Some decided to see it. Others were too scared to. Because it stirred up too much. Its okay. You didnt know.  Hopefully this incident can be used as an opportunity for you to exercise the courage to look inside and see what your triggers in life actually are. Consider. Who talked down to you growing up? Who hurt you? Who made you feel so little ? Pay attention to it. Process it. Address it.  You will see better. Decide better. And live better.",political,Facebook

"Because Joe Biden insists on attacking the unvaccinated we now find ourselves at a place in history where Americans are cheering on the fact that their fellow Americans are being ostracized from everyday life. Even here in a red state like Texas where life liberty and property are supposed to be hallmarks of society every day we are seeing more and more Texans being removed from their jobs schools and other stations in life for simply making a health decision best fits their life situation.  And that divide only deepens when we see Biden and the democrats saying things like the unvaccinated people were ""not nearly as smart as I thought you were."" We see the media pushing narratives like blaming the unvaccinated for the continuation of the pandemic Biden's poor approval numbers hindering economic growth costing jobs and putting unnecessary strain on the healthcare system.  We now live in a country where our borders are being overwhelmed; consumer prices are nearing record highs inflation is quickly pushing us towards a recession employers cannot find help and spending is out of control. And the most common narrative being pushed out of the Whitehouse and in the media is that the unvaccinated are being labeled unemployable and are being ostracized from society so that we can protect the vaccinated from the unvaccinated because the unvaccinated refuse to get the vaccine that didn't protect the vaccinated in the first place.  Personal agency over our own lives is one of the most fundamental tenents of a free society. If you have chosen to be vaccinated because you believe it protects you and it is what's best for you then it shouldn't matter if others are vaccinated because you are protected. And if you are unvaccinated because you believe that it is your right to make healthcare decisions for yourself and your family then what someone else's healthcare choices are should be none of your concern. We have somehow found ourselves in this quasi-socialist communist place where too many Americans now believe the interests of society somehow trump those of the individual. Our nation was founded on the rights of the individual not those of the community. And if we desire to continue to remain a free society and have personal agency over our lives we must move away from this collectivist ideology and return to the ideology of individual rights spelled out by our founders which has served us well for nearly 250 years.  And it starts by electing people who are willing to stand up for you and fight for your individual rights. I will go to Austin to represent you! Not the special interest groups and lobbyists.

Today once again I was asked why I would run because I am Conservative and my running may split the vote and allow a Democrat to win. I am going to break this down Barny style for you (as in Barny the dinosaur).  First I am not a Republican I am a Libertarian/Independent a Constitutional Conservitive and the current GOP is anything but that. I owe nothing to that party I am my own man through and through. Second what makes Michelle Fischbach entitled to be the only one running who is not a Democrat? Because she holds it now? No one can be more worthy? Is that it? I do not buy it. Third President Trump won this district with 65% of the vote if you are worried she might lose now because a Libertarian Independent is running that should tell you she should not be there to start with. Once she is gone the GOP leadership who put her there without input from the grass roots should probably be next to go.  For those in the GOP who are so scared of a Democrat winning because I am running. You Sir or Madam are as much a sheep as those you accuse of being sheep it maybe a different breed but a sheep none the less. You like to call yourself a wolf but a coyote/ hyaena may be a better analogy then a wolf eating off the plate of another. Because your scared you operate out of a fear of loss you are so scared to take a chance that may make things better because you would risk something. One word comes to mind. Coward. Do not try to talk me out of running because of your FEAR. I am not scared; I am putting myself on the line for this. If you keep voting for the lesser of two evils we should not have to listen to you complain about the results.  I believe in playing nice until it is time not to play nice (Roadhouse anyone?) and this is one of those times. President Trump tried to drain the swamp from the top from the throne so to speak. We all see how that worked out. While I am all about draining the swamp and fighting the establishment I do not operate from the top. I am a pig farmer who works in the trenches and I am not scared to get my hands a little dirty. It is a job that needs to be done (anyone know if Mike Rowe is still doing Dirty Jobs?).  I believe character is important I do not play the political games of not telling you where I stand on issues I say where I am and let the cards fall as they may.

Give the Biden administration and his so called VP border czar Kamala Harris the most trivial photo opportunity and they will run with it. The fake news media traitors are right there to help them in their propaganda. Millions of migrants are trying to cross the border living in squalor & filth but now the administration deflects the whole border crisis by some border patrol police on horseback trying to do their job! Now its whipping migrants and how cruel they are. Does not matter that videos that they try to hide show thousands of unvetted migrants with or without COVID being let free to enter the country. Does not matter that they could be terrorists without any background checks coming in to commit more terrorism.

He has selected other complying fraudsters such as Blinken & Mayorkas & Psaki just to name a very few. Mayorkas said we saw horrifying images  painful to watch with the border patrol.

"Errors mistakes blunders incompetence failures that is Biden & his administration. It's a comedy of errors except it is no comedy but rather a ""tragedy of errors"" ! Just when you think the incompetence could not be any worse you find out that it is much worse. The Afghanistan withdrawal was a complete unnecessary disaster and we lost dozens of innocent lives including 13 of our own soldiers. Only God knows how many Americans we have left hopelessly behind. The government will not tell us the truth. Today we found out that the drone strike killed 10 innocent people 7 of which were children and not any terrorist as previously claimed. This is atrocious and criminal and Biden should go on trial with those inept generals and commanders in charge. Biden rushed to action to "" correct"" his blunderous withdrawal and killed innocent people. How can you be so stupid yet so arrogant ? To the MSM and the social media giants who so eagerly helped pull off a coup against a true leader and replace him with a senile incompetent imbecile CONGRATULATIONS! Are you happy now ? are you better off ? Is the country and the world safer ? How about you brilliant Biden voters ? Happy now ? Do you enjoy Biden who never takes real questions and when he does it is all scripted & full of lies and he just walks away. Do you enjoy his propagandist representatives who all lie and misrepresent the truth when they are questioned. How come you hypocrites do not fact check them ? Was it not time worthy for you to fact check that the drone strike did NOT kill ISIS-K terrorists but innocent people including children. Would you have checked this if Trump was in charge ? What ideology do you serve ? Deceit fraud lies and incompetence as long as it is a democrat in charge. Even the Vaccine has been politicized and today the FDA rejected the Pfizer booster plan. You are all a part of the tragedy of errors and the reason this country is going down.

Did you know? For those new to our club or its social media page-a brief history of what we DO. But first our story. In 2002 a handful of activists including Debby Kerner Sheila Blake and Alan Guttman got together and- tired of a red shaded community and county- formed Southwest Houston Democrats. Shortly after having found a need for a deeper community focus  they named it Meyerland Area Democrats with Meyerland Westbury Maplewood and Marilyn Estates. And so it began...  It grew as more and more joined and starting inviting speakers and learning how to do GOTV operations in these communities. Neighbor by neighbor grassroots activism at its finest rose. The club became known for being fierce fighters for progressives. A generation of leadership was trained in our club. The club has outgrown every space its occupied from Marco's to Escalante's to Fadi's and now Zoom/Facebook live.  Meyerland Area Democrats besides having stellar programming which has brought in the movers and shakers in the Democratic party from not just Houston but Texas and even nationally has contributed in key ways via its organizing.  Our members in the past 3 cycles alone have made some 75000 calls to voters knocked on the doors of over 25000 homes written 50000 postcards raised thousands for the Harris County Democratic Party the Texas Democratic Party Annie's List TOP and has given to numerous local party clubs.  We are proud to say that the communities we serve have had their voter turnout rise to the top 1 percentile in turnout countywide and our goal of turning these neighborhoods blue has succeeded. When President Pronin was sworn in for his 1st term in 2011 John Culberson was the congressman for much of our membership and community. Today it is Democrat Lizzie Fletcher. HD 134 voted Republican the entire ballot 10 years ago. Today HD134 is voting Democratic- by 30 points for Biden-and now has a Democratic State Rep. Ann Johnson.  Our new Democratic congresswoman Lizzie Fletcher-took her rise in the forum we hosted in January 2017. Many new activists post Trump's election came to our club to get connected- and grew networks into Swing Left and others who won the race. Without Meyerland Area Democrats having organized these communities for years such a victory would have been even more difficult.  Also to note-in 2015 our club was key in Mayor Turner's win- in a race won by 4000 votes. We even got an office from Turner in Westbury. We staged numerous canvass events created and funded mailers and much more. We were front and center in that key fight.  Some other highlights include hosting Beto O'Rourke twice the second townhall we did at Westbury High School with 1600 guests is the largest gathering of progressives in the history of Westbury! Other programming highlights include: James Carville Mayors Turner Parker and Lee Brown. We are also proud of tackling complex issues and pressing for conversations in the community- ie Black Lives Matter GLBT rights public education teachins on various issues . We have partnered with many of our county clubs including Swing Left HBAD ROAD Women TDW Harris Houston Young Stonewall Dems Harris County Young Democrats Bayou Blue Dems Bellaire-Braes Democrats  Sharpstown Democrats (and many more). Call us forum gurus- as our forums have set the standard for fairness and attendance.  To the thousands of you who have through our club over the years thank you. The work of our membership as it is in all our clubs is that of great personal sacrifice. 17 years in and our organization has become one which is seen as one of our state's premiere organizations for the party. We also happen to represent the largest number of Jewish American Democrats of any local club in the state!  See you soon (on Zoom)- Art Pronin President,political,Facebook

"The state of this world is getting scary. It's unfortunate that many do not see it.  Millions are marching around the world in protest every weekend against COVID-19 lockdowns vaccine mandates and the removal of civil rights liberties and freedoms. With at least a hundred thousand protesting in cities and towns around Australia.  ""If you forget the past you are doomed to repeat it."" ""I don't agree with what you say but I'll give my life defending your right to say it.""  Two very important statements the kids of today are not being taught. Free speech is something the whole world needs. Even racist hatred and down right evil things need to be allowed to be said. Gives us the opportunity to hit back through words NOT violence.  Let's start with Covid-19:  The fear being pushed by politicians and the media about COVID-19 is out of control. No I am not one of those that think COVID-19 is a hoax. COVID-19 is real. As I read once: Do I believe that people are getting sick? Yes. Do I believe that people are dying? Yes. Do I believe some hospitals are overrun? Yes. Do I believe nurses and healthcare workers are terrified? Yes. Do I believe China is lying about it's numbers? Yes. Do I believe COVID-19 was made in a lab? Yes. Do I believe China is responsible? Yes. Do I believe COVID-19 is being politicized? Yes. Do I believe COVID-19 is being used to strip Americans and Australians of their rights? Yes. Do I believe there's a bigger picture than what politicians and the media are telling us? Yes. Do I believe this is more about power and control than anything else? Yes. Do I believe we as Australians just set a dangerous precedent for our freedoms? Yes... and I am much more terrified of that than any virus.  Am I an anti-vaxxer? No I am 100% for vaccines. Myself and my family are all vaccinated for everything except for the COVID-19 vaccine. No I do not plan to get the COVID-19 Vaccine. I will not inject a vaccine into my body that is being forced upon me. Especially a vaccine that was ready in less than a year. It takes at least 5 years to fully test a vaccine. We do NOT know the long term side effects yet. I am Anti-MANDATORY vaccine I am not Anti-Vaccine. Take the vaccine if you want I support you decision to take it. But don't force it on me.  I do not believe in lockdowns or mask mandates. We lived with Influenza (a virus that had a confirmed 0.13% death rate for the years 2016-2017) for generations without mask mandates or lockdowns. I used 2016-2017 because they are the latest years where the numbers are confirmed: COVID-19 is far more deadly for over 60's than Influenza particularly those with underlying conditions with a death rate of about 0.66%. However When you account for elderly patients dying to COVID-19 without an underlying condition that death rate drops to 0.2%. Compared to the 0.08% Death rate for under 60's with COVID-19 dropping further the younger the bracket. The Delta variant is less deadly but more contagious. Please note I am talking about the death rate (Your chance to die if you get infected) not number of deaths. These numbers are based from the CDC's own words that 90% of COVID-19 cases will go completely undetected as most of the population is asymptomatic to the COVID-19 Virus. All this information can be found on the CDC website.  Now while the death rate is higher than influenza in the older generation. This is no reason to completely shut down a country even at the high end of 0.66%. No one wants to even talk about the rising rate of ""Self harm"" especially in teenagers due to lockdowns. These lockdowns are causing far more damage than they are preventing Not just in ""self harm"" rates. Source:  Next Abortion:  Abortion is getting out of control. The latest data from Planned Parenthood states that over 98%... YES OVER 98% of the reasons given for Abortion is ""Unwanted Baby"". Less than 2% is due to Rape / Incest. 2 reasons that are the only time I ever agree with Abortion and ONLY before a heartbeat. Source:  Both men and women need to take some responsibility for your own actions. If you cannot afford / want to bring a baby into the world then Wrap it Swallow it Flush it Throw it or just say no. But please STOP using Abortion as a contraceptive. Stop killing babies because you couldn't keep your pants zipped up. I accept that accidents happen but that's the risk you take when you say yes. Deal with the consequences of your actions.  And now for the US itself:  The US is being run by a senile dementia ridden old fart controlled by special interest groups in the hopes of turning America into a communist dictatorship. The Left leaning Mainstream Media is complicit in this they regularly distort the truth to push their own agenda. Notice they are not reporting on the Phone call between President Biden and the Afghan President Ashraf Ghani. A phone call that if it happened under President Trump He would be rightfully impeached before the media could even report on it.  In this phone call President Biden's own words pressured President Ghani to distort the truth: President Biden to President Ghani: ""And theres a need whether it is true or not there is a need to project a different picture."" Source:  This is not the first time President Biden has pressured another country to help him politically: Then Vice-President Biden with President Obama's backing threatened to withhold aid money if a prosecutor that was investigating the company Hunter Biden was working at was not fired. Source from then Vice-President Biden's own lips:   There are multiple other examples of corruption lies and propaganda by the Biden administration and it's buddies in the media. However this post will become a novel if I continue. Follow me for more examples in future posts.  And finally Australia:  Australia itself is sliding down a dark path. Our country is done as we know it if the population doesn't wake up and soon.  Queensland is opening a concentration camp in the center of the state. Source:  Victoria is the next communist China puppet state. Led by a known Communist supporter. Source: Multiple other articles showing the corruption of Daniel Andrews.  The Federal Government just passed a spy bill. Allowing them to access our phones and upload or delete data at will. Source:  The media around the world doesn't even care that Australia has begun a process to strip its citizens of what little rights we had. I fear that most Australians have forgotten what happened 80 years ago. We don't even have the means to defend ourselves any more they are scared another Eureka Stockade will happen.  It is time for Australians to take a stand. It is time for us to take our country back but we need help. We need the world to care about what is currently taking place in Australia.  Australia must ditch the crown. We must become a Constitutional Federal Republic. We do not have a Bill of Rights that needs to change. We deserve our freedom. But we must earn it first.

Friends youve heard about the news from Kabul. Two suicide bomb attacks killed thirteen U.S. service members and wounded eighteen other troops. At least 90 Afghans were killed.  Yesterday was the deadliest single day for the U.S. military in Afghanistan in a decade.  Our hearts ache for the loss of life and the broken families left behind. It hurts all the more that this atrocity was avoidable.  I said in April that President Biden was committing a grave error in extending the May 1 withdrawal date negotiated by President Trump. I said that if any additional American soldiers died between May 1 and September 11 the responsibility would fall squarely on Joe Bidens shoulders.  It has happened.  The last American should have departed by May before the start of the fighting season. Instead thousands have been put in harms way to suit Joe Bidens needlessly extended timetable.  Its a failure of leadership.  Luckily our truce with the Taliban negotiated by President Trump has held as we evacuate the remaining Americans in-country. The attacks were committed by an ISIS affiliate who is also an enemy to the Taliban.  The most important thing moving forward that we must remember is that nothing has changed. Afghanistan is no more critical to U.S. national security than it was one week ago. We are right to leave. A withdrawalno matter how poorly managedis preferential to continuing a war without purpose.  Do not allow a terrorist attack to dictate U.S. foreign policy.  Some peopleboth Republicans and Democratswant to reinvade the whole country. Not only would this be a strategic mistake but the attacks we saw yesterday would become a daily occurrence. Most Americans agree the costs are not worth another decade of war and occupation.  We pray that those thirteen lives are the last ones to be needlessly sacrificed in Afghanistan. Let us continue to bring our troops home safe and whole.  God bless.  -Sgt. Dan McKnight Chairman BringOurTroopsHome.US,political,Facebook
AFGHANISTAN WHAT EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD KNOW  Today was a tough day. A sad day. A day that should have and could have been prevented. Today was the greatest single loss of life our American military has suffered in ten years. In fact this whole fiasco or my better stated this catastrophe could have been prevented. To provide you a better understanding of the current situation and how/why we are where we are please allow me to provide some background and much needed truth and even better truth in context.  Over the last few days I have directly and personally spoken with and heard from former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo former DNI John Ratcliffe and the current Secretaries of Defense State Homeland Security Director of National Intelligence and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. The following is the best and most honest account and assessment I can provide to my constituents and the American People without divulging any specific classified information.  PRESIDENT TRUMPS PLAN FOR WITHDRAWAL  On Feb 29 2020 Pres Trump announced he had reached an agreement to withdraw American forces from Afghanistan by May 2021. This deal was a conditions based withdrawal and if certain conditions werent being met the US reserved the right to delay or tear up the deal. These conditions?  The Taliban would agree to  cut all ties with Al-Queda enter into a peaceful power sharing agreement with the Afghani Govt led by Pres Ghani Honor all checkpoints manned by Afghan troops Not to attack or destabilize provincial capitals protect the rights of women & minorities not attack US Troops  Now as you may have guessed the Taliban didnt always live up to their side of the bargain. They probed. They violated. On numerous occasions. And somewhat of a cycle would play out.  1. Taliban violates agreement 2. US hits back hard with Afghan ground forces with strong US air cover. 3. Taliban retreats 4. Americans reach out via back channels 5. Taliban properly disciplined agrees not to repeat  And these (mostly) minor violations would continue with the same result. You see they were probing and testing our resolve. They wanted to see what they could get away with. If they were met with strength? Theyd back off. But If they were met with weakness then you can guess how they would have responded. Well you dont have to guess because in 2021 they met with mush and as we witnessed they grew increasingly emboldened and aggressive.  At this point we need to be fair and absolutely clear. Had President Trump served another term none of us know exactly how this withdrawal would have played out. We dont. And we never will. For sure anyway. But there are some pretty strong clues that point to a very different outcome.  First Pres Trump listened intently to his advisors on this issue and adjusted his own perception and plans accordingly. He was deeply committed to getting all Americans out and if necessary our proven Afghan allies. He was also just as committed to ensuring that the Taliban if they came to power would get nothing nada zilch not one piece of American equipment. I was told repeatedly by folks that were in the room with the President that he wanted and I quote Not even a styrofoam cooler with an American flag on it left behind. He also said more than once Not a single bullet not one. Not a single American bullet is gonna be left.  So how did we get from that to where we are today?  Many in the Biden Administration and some of their media allies are trying to push out the myth that the unraveling of the Afghan Govt and military caught even the intelligence community by surprise. This is an utter and provable lie. When Pres Trump would meet with his intel team he would ask every time if conditions are not met and honored how long do you all think the Afghanis will last? EVERY voice shared the same assessment. Most likely a few weeks. At best a month or two. The President himself often would share that he didnt think theyd last two days. Without agreed upon conditions being a reality a clear disaster awaited.  And theres some strong evidence that points to the fact that this would almost assuredly played out differently under a Trump Administration. From the day the agreement was reached over the next year and a half not one American was lost to anger in Afghanistan. We drew down from 15000 to 2500 troops and there was enviable stability. Today we have twice as many boots on the ground and we have chaos.  For years in Afghanistan we would root out and kill bad guys and now we are begging for mercy from some of these very same thugs. Now the Taliban have more Blackhawk helicopters than the nation of Australia. Toss a $50 M67 grenade into a $20 million Blackhawk and viola no more high tech weaponry in the hands of the Taliban or Iran or China. The obvious best case scenario for the $85 billion worth of equipment left behind would have been for us to take the valuable stuff out with us. But failing that its inexcusable and quite frankly unforgivable that it wasnt destroyed before falling into enemy hands. There are reports that Blackhawks and other highly sensitive and advanced weaponry is already being couriered to Iran and China. And if true which it almost certainly is wed have to expect that China is going to do everything within their power to reverse engineer our cutting edge technology.  Please allow me to be crystal clear. What we have witnessed in the last two months is not a failure of intelligence in any way it is a failure to accept/acknowledge the intelligence and take appropriate action. The Afghanistan catastrophe and the subsequent loss of life equipment and prestige is a failure of leadership.  Joe Biden moved the original May 1st deadline to August 31st. While I agreed then and still do now that the original deadline needed to be moved Aug 31st was not the right time. It was obvious by the Spring the Taliban were acting in bad faith. Other than laying off our troops they werent honoring the terms of the agreement. They were making moves to simply wait us out and then strike against the Afghan government the moment we left. Under just such a scenario we were really left with two choices. Ramp back up and stay put or leave but leave at the beginning of winter evac all but a skeleton crew of American civilians AND have executable plans in place to withdraw any and all Americans that remained and proven Afghan allies and then destroy all sensitive equipment that couldnt be removed. Unfortunately and tragically no such plans were ever drawn up and the deadline wasnt moved.  In Afghanistan fighting is seasonal. Always has been. The climate is unmerciful and the Afghan winter doesnt lend itself to being all that conducive to combat operations. The fighting season begins in the spring and ends in the late fall. In the winter months over the past several decades many Taliban fighters would head over to Pakistan to rest and recoup. If Biden knew the Feb 2020 agreed upon conditions werent being honored (they werent) and if he was still hellbent on leaving (he was) the very least he should have done was set a Dec departure. This way the fledging Ghani Govt and military could have had 4-5 months to get their footing and build confidence in themselves and one another. This would simply have given them the best chance for success. Again no guarantees they would have survived but not giving them this opportunity was criminally negligent.  So where are we now and where do we go from here?  On July 8th Joe Biden said in no uncertain terms he didnt trust the Taliban. I believe If Im not mistaken he reiterated that same sentiment again today. So that begs the question. If thats true Sir why are you reportedly sharing sensitive contact information and the whereabouts of American citizens with THE TALIBAN? If this is proven to be true Id say it rises to the level of an impeachable offense. Further Mr Biden said today that he would retaliate against those who murdered our Marines. How exactly is that going to be accomplished when hes still ordering our military to runaway and leave by this arbitrary Aug 31st deadline?! Our departure would render the closest base from which to launch a strike about 8 flying hours away!  The Aug 31st deadline is arbitrary. Please make no mistake about that. And now Biden has allowed it to become a Taliban red line?! Since when were these thugs allowed to decide American foreign policy?! Sticking to the 31st is akin to an unconditional surrender. We have 13 new gold star families in the homeland somewhere between 1000-4000 Americans still in theater and thousands more proven Afghan allies in harms way $85 billion in equipment left behind and Biden and his double down woke crew is still insisting on leaving in a few days.  Every military and intelligence advisor and expert agrees we CANNOT evacuate all of the Americans that want to leave by Aug 31st. Same with our allies. Cant do it.  A QUICK SIDE BAR ON BAGRAM AIR BASE  25 miles north of Kabul Airport where are troops are now and where the suicide attack today took place is Bagram Air Base. It was the largest base the US operated in Afghanistan. And we gave it up. Why? Because Joe Biden wouldnt allow for enough US forces present to keep it. So on July 1st 2021 without telling our Afghan allies the last remaining American forces slipped away under cover of night. 7 weeks later the Bagram fell to the Taliban.  History is watching. 20 years of trust has evaporated in 2 months. There are geopolitical implications as well and they reach far beyond Afghanistan. This debacle and Joe Bidens lack of leadership is playing directly into the narrative of the Chinese Communists in Beijing and in Putins Kremlin. They assert that America is a nation in decline and our power is waning. They tell anyone who will listen that the Americans show only weakness to their enemies and are treacherous to their friends. The last two months certainly hasnt assuaged our allies fears in this regard. What do you think our friends in Eastern Europe are thinking right now? Do you think many are sleeping easy tonight in Kiev? Or Lithuania? Or Poland? How about Kuwait? Would we have their backs now?! And there are most definitely millions on the island nation of Taiwan tossing and turning this very night.  Joe Biden proclaimed last month that this wouldnt be another Saigon. Well he was right. Its worse. 13 Americans are dead more wounded scores of the innocent slaughtered and chaos reigns. What should we do to gain some semblance of order sanity honor and standing?  Push the timeline back and declare we will leave when our mission is complete. That mission will be complete after we  1. Take back Bagram 2. Fly in Armor and a sufficient force to hold Bagram evacuate ALL remaining Americans & proven allies 3. Expand and then secure permitted around Kabul Airport 3. Smash ISIS-K and kill every last son of a bitch who planned/ordered/carried out murderous attack on our brave Marines 4. Retrieve sensitive equipment & weaponry and destroy any that cant be securely evacd out 5. If the Taliban resistance persists take back Kabul (by most accounts there are only 6000 Taliban holding the city) and expose them for the bullying thugs that they are.  Once our mission has been accomplished then and only then leave.  I call Nancy Pelosi to immediately bring the House back into session. We are a co-equal branch of government and we must demand answers from this administration. All members of Congress should be briefed on the current situation and all questions from members should be answered in a secure classified setting if necessary in full. Committees of jurisdiction namely Armed Services (of which Im a member) Intel Foreign Affairs and Homeland Security should immediately begin oversight hearings. We must get top Administration officials in front of Congress and hear their sworn testimony. We have to get answers so we can ensure that this never happens again. Ever.  Please join me in keeping our brave warriors in your thoughts hearts and prayers. They gave everything and we owe it to them to give our all to complete the mission. Rest In Peace Heroes.

Its been a hard week seeing what's happening in Afghanistan.  Like many of you all I watched videos from the Kabul airport and saw pictures of military planes full of people fleeing. Gut wrenching stuff.  I served in Afghanistan from 2005 to 2006.  At that point Al Qaeda in Afghanistan had been decimated and we were thoroughly into the nation-building part of the war.  I was stationed in a remote desert outpost north of Kandahar with a couple dozen soldiers. Poppies grew against the barricades of our little fort.  We had a company of Afghan soldiers that lived just outside our razor-wire fence in their own area. Part of our job involved training and running missions with them.  Wed do that a few times a week. Wed get into our Humvees with our weapons and head out to a very small village a few hours away.  Most of the missions were humanitarian. Coordinating construction for wells and schools (which we paid for). Veterinarian missions to de-worm goats and sheep. Handing out solar-powered radios (hugely popular went fast).  Our little group of American soldiers tried hard to build goodwill everywhere we went. We were always handing stuff out having tea with the local elders kicking soccer balls around with the kids.  We were attacked by the Taliban several times. Usually with rockets sometimes with small-arms fire. I remember once at night being outside and suddenly seeing small bright lights fly overhead and being confused for a second. Then the rockets started to land and I realized those small lights had been tracer rounds.  But IEDs were the biggest threat. We were constantly on the lookout for freshly turned dirt near the road and drove off-road as much as possible. I was usually the driver on our missions and I still remember what it felt like to drive across a narrow bridge or some other chokepoint where you knew an IED would be unavoidable if it detonated. We all just held our breath and I drove as fast as possible.  Soldiers were hurt and killed including a close friend of mine the week we were set to leave.  And then I boarded a helicopter and went home.  After I left I was never able to get a good sense of how things were actually going. We heard the same cautious optimism from our leaders for years but it was hard to read much into that. There was visible progress and visible failure. President George Bush used to talk about an Afghanistan that could govern and defend itself. How close were we? How many more years would it take?  And now we know. Despite a massive effort we never even came close.  Trumps deal with the Taliban in 2018 created certainty that we would in fact be leaving. As a result the Taliban largely stopped attacking our troops. They were waiting.  We proceeded with our exit because we had already given Afghanistan everything we could. We poured $90 billion into the Afghan military and stayed for an entire generation - at a loss of nearly 2500 American servicemembers.  The Afghan army numbered close to 300000 at least on paper. They had certainly shown a willingness to fight having already lost 66000 soldiers in the last 20 years.  Afghanistan has 34 provinces. On August 6th the Taliban captured their first provincial capital. This wasnt a huge shock because the province was nestled between Iran and Pakistan farther from the national capital of Kabul than any other province. It was the lowest-hanging piece of fruit for the Taliban. That said it was taken with virtually no resistance which in retrospect was a sign of things to come.  In the next two days the Taliban captured four more provincial capitals.  In the next five days another 10 provincial capitals fell.  In the next three days it was over. The national capital of Kabul fell the president fled.  Thats nine days from the first province to the rest.  While a sizable number of elite Afghan soldiers put up a fight - and may now be regrouping in the Panjshir Valley north of Kabul - what we saw from the army regulars was near-instant capitulation. The bulk of the Afghan army wasnt defeated - it evaporated.  Its hard to put ourselves in the shoes of those Afghan soldiers and to understand their calculations - but it isnt hard to see what their ultimate decision was and that was essentially to walk off the battlefield en masse.  Now the mission is evacuation. Americans still in Afghanistan interpreters and their families and others who are at extreme risk - like 250 female judges who were still serving until this week - must be flown out of the country immediately.  Here are three major mistakes that have hindered the evacuation mission:  The first was the previous administrations decision to sharply reduce the processing of Special Immigrant Visas. Thats a program that was created specifically for Afghans and Iraqis who helped us and its supposed to be an expedited process to get them safely out of the country. It involves an administrative review that is arduous and bureaucratic even when its functioning - but Trump blocked almost all requests.  When Biden took over the wait-list had 17000 Afghans on it. That wasnt an oversight that was Trump lumping these people in with his broader anti-immigration message and not caring about the consequences. (Incidentally after seeing recent events he put out a statement saying that Afghans who assisted the U.S. should be allowed to seek refuge.)  That said fixing the SIV process should have been a much higher priority for the current administration. That was our second mistake. Yes the evaporation of the Afghan army was a shock. But we plan for unlikely contingencies all the time. That should have been one. There was no reason not to expedite the process by bringing the applicants to a U.S. territory like Guam and allowing the rest of the application process to occur there. Thats exactly what we did in 1975 when we left Vietnam. The governor of Guam even indicated that the island was prepared to accept them.  That should have happened back in April but it absolutely should have happened once we saw the Taliban making swift gains across the country in early July. Weve hit the gas on the process now and were evacuating several thousand people per day. Thats progress but it shows we could have sped things up much sooner.  Third we should not have given away the Bagram airfield before the evacuation mission was complete. If we were going to need to conduct a rapid large-scale evacuation we were going to need Bagram which was our largest base and the most fortified airfield. We left it in early July and now we have to rely on the airport in Kabul to conduct evacuation operations. Its much harder to defend and more limited in terms of air traffic given that it only has one runway while the airfield at Bagram has two.  Now we have no choice but to conduct our evacuation mission under extreme pressure. Thats a bad situation to be in and a tough mission but its a mission that we have an obligation to carry out. We dont get to call it a day and walk away from these people who helped us many of whom will surely die if we dont make the decision to save them.  We owe them as a nation - but I owe them personally. Every time we ran a mission I was putting my life in the hands of my interpreter. Our interpreter was at greater risk than any of us because the Taliban knew that if you take out the interpreter it makes the whole unit ineffective.  And he never ever let me down. Every mission every moment he was always by my side. I moved he moved. When we were in a village and a group of men suddenly started walking towards our team he would step forward and start speaking as quickly and calmly as he could. And this is the guy were going to cut loose? Unacceptable.  The same goes for that interpreters family. My interpreters wife and children became targets as soon as he ran his first mission with us. They took that risk together as a family so our obligation extends to them as a family.  Getting those folks out is the right thing to do but its also in our national interest. If we dont get them out whats going to happen the next time we need to ask locals in a foreign country to help us? How are those locals going to look at our soldiers when we ask them to trust us?  And to the 16 House Republicans who voted against the bill to speed up the visa applications there is no possible defense for that. To do that deliberately - knowing what it could lead to for those who helped us - is unconscionable.  We're already hearing some generic anti-refugee sentiment from some of these folks. I'd remind them of our history with respect to Vietnam.  After we left Vietnam we had a policy geared specifically to Vietnamese refugees. We helped people who otherwise would have been killed.  We don't regret that decision - we're proud of it.  One of those people who we saved became my next-door neighbor when I was a kid. He was a former officer for the South Vietnamese Army - who probably would have been killed if he hadnt gotten out - and by some amazing act of grace he and his wife landed in Chapel Hill North Carolina.  His son became one of my best friends. We grew up together. I never fully appreciated his familys story until I was in college. He had the opportunity to live a wonderful life because our country decided to keep its commitments to those who had fought with us.  As it turns out we couldnt bring democracy to Afghanistan - but we can decide to keep our commitments to those who fought for it with us.  That is now the mission and we must not fail.  - Jeff Jackson,political,Facebook

"Have you noticed the absence of the obnoxious journalists & reporters since Biden got elected ? I am talking of the bought and paid for democrat operatives acting as news people like Jim Acosta & Jake Tapper & Brian Stelter & the Cuomo boy..........Chris Cuomo  just to name a few. They are absent because they know that everyone knows they are fake journalists. Questioning Biden like they questioned President Trump or rather harassed him with lies and misrepresentations would be too revealing of Biden and his spokespersons & their incompetence and lies & ineptness.They would make Jen Psaki look like the nut she is & the whole Biden administration would be exposed. They would lose favor & perhaps their jobs if they crossed who holds their leash. The democrats have such plants as fake journalists in all of the MSM including the NY Times and WAPO. They also control and dictate to their giant social media servants.These organizations are an arm of the corrupt democrat party. With Trump they were eager to create false scandals and crises but with Biden they cover up his major blunders and incompetence.Just take a look at the Afghanistan debacle and mess. look at the border crisis the inflation and the Covid mess. Look at the prices of food and gas. Look at the constant lies & all the other disasters in about 7 months ! If any of this was under Trump I think he would have been crucified and I mean literally crucified. They have no shame or honor to do a job well done with honesty and integrity. They have become perverted by the democrats & are a major part of the corruption. Once the media was the watchdogs over the politicians but now they are the lapdogs of the democrat party. The few mentioned above are just a few of many more fake journalist in MSNBC ABC NBC CBS  CNN LA Times NY times & WAPO and much more including FOX. I cannot forget to mention the stellar Rachel Maddow and Don Lemon & cute blinking eyes Anderson Cooper. There are too many more to mention but they are obvious to anyone who watches the media ! One of the greatest competent men to become president Donald Trump was trashed and demonized endlessly and a real corrupt demon Joe Biden has been lionized & made into a hero despite almost 50 years of constant failures & lies and deception. With the help of the fake & dishonest journalists and fake media & the corrupt democrat machinery & soulless activists Joe Biden was supposedly the winner of the Presidential elections. If you believe that Joe Biden got 80 million votes sitting in the basement you got to also believe that the famous ""Brooklyn Bridge"" was sold to 80 million people 80 million times.

Oh God the degree of incompetence of Joe Biden is mind boggling. He really thinks that there was no way to get out of Kabul without the chaos and the disaster he created. The Vice President has disappeared and general Milley head of the army seems angry at Americans expecting a better exit strategy !!! It seems that incompetence ineptness unprofessionalism & pure stupidity trickles down from Biden to his VP to the Secretary of State the Pentagon the Intelligence Services and Homeland security and the NSA & some of the army chiefs. That is what you get when you select people strictly based on everything including race & gender & ethnicity but not based on merit & experience and intelligence and capabilitiy. The media should be destroyed for their role in all of this. Biden should be impeached and the people need to rise up and unite to end this obvious destruction of their country. The Chinese could not have wished for a more incapable and incompetent and mentally challenged & clueless person to have to deal with regarding the U.S. ! The Taliban got a complete free pass after 20 years of American sacrifice of blood tears loss of life and money. Now those Chinese will own Afghanistan and its natural wealth & resources and be heroes because they know how to govern to their benefit with astute & wise leaders. I guarantee you that if Trump was in charge none of this would have taken place. How tragic Biden is for America is infinite.,political,Facebook

A Liberal Explains the Cause of High Gas Prices Forget the fact that Joe Biden killed the Keystone Pipeline deal and cost the U.S. thousands of jobs and forget that he put a moratorium on all new oil and gas leases on federal land and offshore waters. Dont think about how he is suffocating domestic oil production with mandates such as establishing comprehensive standards of performance and emission guidelines from existing oil and gas operations by September 2021 and ordering Texas to submit State Implementation Plan for Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) by January 2022. Of course these policies will make us no longer energy independent and U.S. oil imports are expected to rise 2 million barrels per day by 2030 and U.S. gross domestic product will be declining $700 billion during the same span but that is not why gas prices are rising. Neither is fact that U.S. oil production is expected to decline 230000 barrels a day in 2021. Right-wing nut job conspiracy theorists and QAnon will tell you that is reason gas prices are going up. Those people are spreading disinformation! They might even try to tell you how Joe Biden waived sanctions on Russias pipeline while at the same time pulling the plug on our own Keystone pipeline which infuriated one of our strongest allies in Canada. While he did give our Russian enemy the same thing he took away from our neighboring Canadian allies that is not why gas prices are high. And dont think about how he hamstrung domestic oil production then recently turned around and asked OPEC to produce more oil instead of figuring out a way for the U.S. to produce more oil even though he ran on an America first platform. His inconsistent messaging and terrible policies have nothing to do with the high price of gas. That is nothing more than a right-wing conspiracy being spread by unsophisticated xenophobic white supremacists. These people probably want you to think about his rhetoric during the 2020 campaign when he called Saudi Arabia a pariah state with no redeeming social value only to see Saudi Arabia retaliate immediately after Joe Biden took office by committing to unilaterally cut 1 million barrels of oil. People spreading disinformation want you to believe that they did this to pressure Joe Biden into not penalizing Saudi Arabias crown prince Mohammed bin Salam for directly approving the killing of Jamal Khashoggi the Washington Post columnist who was drugged and dismembered in 2018. They probably also want you to believe it worked too and how Joe Biden did nothing to hold Mohammed bin Salam accountable for fear of upsetting U.S. Arabian allies. Some people might even argue that he failed on the humanitarian front by not seeking justice for the killing of an American citizen and he also failed on an economic front as well by allowing himself to be bullied by the Saudis. Even though this is a blatant lie let's just say he did fail on multiple fronts by not taking a clear position on that foreign policy decision. So what? That is not the reason gas prices are going up. In fact none of Joe Bidens terrible policies or bad decisions have anything to do with the price of gas today. Any expert will tell you that it is physically impossible for Joe Biden to cause a rise in the price of gas. Follow the science. All the data suggests that a man who wears aviator shades and eats ice cream could never screw anything up so bad that gas prices could rise 50% in just 8 months. It is metaphysically impossible. Blaming Joe Biden for the rise in gas prices is nothing more than a wild conspiracy theory. The real reason that gas prices are so high today are because of one man and one man alone. DONALD J.

"To all : President Trump was a great American patriot and leader. His presidency was everything but dictatorial. His leadership was compassionate and smart and good for the country despite all the fake propaganda and demonization by the democrats and the fake news media. He governed with love of country and an America First ideology and not of party and partisanship and corruption. He placed the interests of the American people first and foremost. He was smart in dealing with foreign powers friends and foes included and brought respect and dignity to America. He brought back jobs that had been lost forever and created the greatest economy in the history of the country with record employment and growth for all including every minority group. He did this despite the greatest slander misinformation collusion and multiple coup attempts against his Presidency and his character and his administration. He did this despite one of the worst pandemics in modern history and constant barrage of attacks by the democrats and their allies in the fake MSM and despite two hoaxes of an impeachment and Russian collusion hoax.He created a vaccine in record time when everyone of his opponents made fun of him and ridiculed him. operation ""warp speed"" has saved tens of thousands of lives  if not millions in this country and the world. He was falsely called a racist antisemite Hitlerian dictatorial and many other derogatory names all as part of the attempt to cheat him out of a second term which he won by a landslide and millions of more votes than the votes of his first term election.History is not subject to the manipulations and machinations of the corrupt few and time will be the ultimate rightful judge of this man and his love for his country and people. The swamp and the deep state won but the majority of The American people know the truth and will not allow it to continue to rule for long. Many have been fooled and misled but the awakening is here and The People will take over their country from the greedy and the corrupt and powerful. God has always watched over America and its people because despite all its flaws and all its shortcomings it is the most democratic country in the history of mankind and a force for good and benevolence. It is no wonder everyone is trying to come here from all over the globe and whether they come legally or unlawfully they never want to leave.

Hello! I'm Michael and I'm running for Randolph Board of Education. I call my platform the #2040Plan in reference to the year that a child born on Election Day this year will graduate high school and head out into the world. When that day comes what sort of world will they face and how well will we have shaped that child to meet the challenges of tomorrow? I believe the answer to these questions depends on how we as a community address the following issues:   Technology  The pandemic was a crash course for us on just how much we can accomplish with technology. It also exposed how much we still have to invest in both the curriculum and infrastructure to create a fully integrated technology program that will prepare the students of today for the world of tomorrow. I've spent nearly twenty years in the technology industry and over that time have worked with organizations from small businesses to Fortune 50 corporations to build successful technology programs. My goal is to ensure that every student parent and staff member has the tools training and vision necessary to ensure that our children can thrive in the world of 2040.   Culture  Today's world is more diverse and interconnected than ever and tomorrow's world will be even more so. For today's children to thrive we as parents and educators need to do better at shaping children with a more worldly perspective. Our schools need a greater emphasis on language world history international relations and cultural understanding. My goal is to encourage movement toward a curriculum that treats all cultures with respect and teaches children to view their world and their interactions from different points of view. I support an open and honest conversation of current events based on facts and mutual respect and believe that our children can only benefit from learning to see the world with empathy and understanding for experiences outside of their own.   Talent  The continued success of Randolph's educational programs depends on fostering an organizational culture that attracts and retains the very best faculty. Like any other organization our district's greatest assets are its employees. Ensuring that faculty are free to focus on being the best educators they can be is among my top priorities. How we measure performance and academics from both a student and a faculty perspective is paramount to this effort. I will strive to ensure that the contributions of our faculty are identified and properly recognized. In fulfilling these promises I believe we can drive a culture of excellence and innovation that will guarantee our children's future success.   Transparency  School boards exist to represent the community's concerns to the administration and represent the needs of the district to the community. I believe that the board should consider the opinions and seek the community's advice and consent when dealing in matters of district policy and education. This role has never been more critical than it is now in the digital age when communications are more rapid and information flows more freely than ever before. As a board member I will work with my fellow board members to facilitate this process through all authorized means. No decisions should be made in the dark. No board should allow the personal ideologies of its membership to trump its obligation to be servants of the community. This sense of civic responsibility is crucial not only to the proper functioning of the district but also in setting the right example for our children to become good leaders amongst their own generation.  Finally I am poignantly aware that our community has been through a lot lately. I pledge to you that I will work to build bridges provide principled leadership and at all times be ready to listen empathetically. I have great faith that our community is as resilient as they come and that all of us simply want the very best for our children. Though we may not always agree we can never forget that we are a community and that all members of our community deserve respect. I therefore promise to maintain a respectful dialogue throughout this process toward the current Board members other candidates and the community. To at all times focus on helping Randolph heal the divisions that have threatened to tear us apart so that we can return to keeping our eyes on the future of our district and our children.  My door is always open and I encourage a public and transparent campaign among all candidates. Any resident is welcome to a private or public conversation on these or any other issues. I look forward to getting to know so many of you that I've not met yet and to giving my all to help ensure that our children receive the very best educational program we can provide.,political,Facebook

Class is in session. Stand. Pledge. Sit.  Attention Trump Save America Pac donors/would be donors: Trump has not spent even a dime on ANY ballot reviews Donald Trump has been promoting.  FACT Out of the $75 Million in donations the former President has ranked in in 2021 alone donations have thus far gone to Trumps travel Trumps legal fees and Trump's staff. Much of the donations are being held in cash. Currently the Arizona recount via Cyber Ninjas is being paid for via private donations which are not being disclosed.  So when you see a post from Trump or Trumps Save America Pac that say We need you to join the fight to SECURE OUR ELECTIONS! you are just donating to one of the former Presidents most lucrative funds. NONE of this money is actually going to ANY elections previous or moving forward.  Lets look at some other elections facts because the big lie is kinda getting old now and any 12 year old that can do research for a book report could find this information if they chose to.  FACT Republicans OUTPERFORMED Democrats up and down ballot in the 2020 election.  Republicans gained 13 seats in Congress with zero losses by GOP incumbents. Every House Republican in a tossup race won. A record 35 Republican women won election to Congress. Republicans won 59 of 98 state legislative chambersa net gain of two state houses and 141 seats across the country.  FACT There are even Republicans that won in their own election in 2020 that say the election was rigged. For example in Arizona Paul Gosar and Andy Biggs both objected to the certification of the election for Joe Biden based on fraud DESPITE the fact that they won in their own elections. So if the election was rigged against Donald Trump how would Republicans then win their own seats? Paul Gosar and Andy Biggs are not the only ones. Republicans Lauren Boebert Marjorie Taylor Greene and Andrew Clyde all won in Georgia. I could go on. In other words how could Democrats able to rig the election for Joe Biden to win yet they seemingly were unable to rig down ballot elections? Shouldnt these Republicans ask for a recount of their own wins if voting in these states are in question?  And what about Dominion voting machines?  FACT Dominion software was not used in ONLY states that Trump lost and/or states that Trump has filed lawsuits in. The fact of the matter is that this software was used in TWENTY-FOUR STATES.  FACT Dominion software was used in. ONLY SIX STATES that went BLUE for Biden. These include Nevada Arizona Wisconsin Michigan Pennsylvania and Georgia. The remaining EIGHTEEN was won by Donald Trump.  FACT Donald Trump filed lawsuits in the above six states but DID NOT in the ladder eighteen.  So WHY would Dominion software be hacked in some way in just six states when these machines could have all been hacked to vote for Biden? Why JUST these six? And WHY isnt Trump filing lawsuits in ALL 24 STATES? In theory wouldnt you want to file lawsuits in every state that used Dominion as to find out what it was about just these six states machines?  And for that matter how do we know that if fraud occurred some of the dominion software in states that went red could have in the same way have been hacked to go red when they REALLY went blue?  Just totally stupid right?  So lets discuss whats really going on here with this election and just MOVE ON because this debate got stale months ago. Donald Trump lost this election for TWO main reasons.  1. Trump lost voters. These voters either switched to Biden or they did not vote for President and voted for Republicans down ballot. Here is the specific breakdown of 2020 voters per Pew:  *Biden made gains with suburban voters. In 2020 Biden improved upon Clintons vote share with suburban voters: 45% supported Clinton in 2016 vs. 54% for Biden in 2020. This shift was also seen among White voters: Trump narrowly won White suburban voters by 4 points in 2020 (51%-47%); he carried this group by 16 points in 2016 (54%-38%). At the same time Trump grew his vote share among rural voters. In 2016 Trump won 59% of rural voters a number that rose to 65% in 2020.  *Trump made gains among Hispanic voters. Even as Biden held on to a majority of Hispanic voters in 2020 Trump made gains among this group overall. There was a wide educational divide among Hispanic voters: Trump did substantially better with those without a college degree than college-educated Hispanic voters (41% vs. 30%).  *Apart from the small shift among Hispanic voters Joe Bidens electoral coalition looked much like Hillary Clintons with Black Hispanic and Asian voters and those of other races casting about four-in-ten of his votes. Black voters remained overwhelmingly loyal to the Democratic Party voting 92%-8% for Biden. Biden made gains with men while Trump improved among women narrowing the gender gap. The gender gap in the 2020 election was narrower than it had been in 2016 both because of gains that Biden made among men and because of gains Trump made among women. In 2020 men were almost evenly divided between Trump and Biden unlike in 2016 when Trump won men by 11 points. Trump won a slightly larger share of womens votes in 2020 than in 2016 (44% vs. 39%) while Bidens share among women was nearly identical to Clintons (55% vs. 54%).  *Biden improved over Clinton among White non-college voters. White voters without a college degree were critical to Trumps victory in 2016 when he won the group by 64% to 28%. In 2018 Democrats were able to gain some ground with these voters earning 36% of the White non-college vote to Republicans 61%. In 2020 Biden roughly maintained Democrats 2018 share among the group improving upon Clintons 2016 performance by receiving the votes of 33%. But Trumps share of the vote among this group  who represented 42% of the total electorate this year  was nearly identical to his vote share in 2016 (65%). Biden grew his support with some religious groups while Trump held his ground. Both Trump and Biden held onto or gained with large groups within their respective religious coalitions. Trumps strong support among White evangelical Protestants ticked up (77% in 2016 84% in 2020) while Biden got more support among atheists and agnostics than did Clinton in 2016.  *After decades of constituting the majority of voters Baby Boomers and members of the Silent Generation made up less than half of the electorate in 2020 (44%) falling below the 52% they constituted in both 2016 and 2018. Gen Z and Millennial voters favored Biden over Trump by margins of about 20 points while Gen Xers and Boomers were more evenly split in their preferences. Gen Z voters those ages 23 and younger constituted 8% of the electorate while Millennials and Gen Xers made up 47% of 2020 voters.  *A record number of voters reported casting ballots by mail in 2020  including many voters who said it was their first time doing so. Nearly half of 2020 voters (46%) said they had voted by mail or absentee and among that group about four-in-ten said it was their first time casting a ballot this way. Hispanic and White voters were more likely than Black voters to have cast absentee or mail ballots while Black voters were more likely than White or Hispanic voters to have voted early in person. Urban and suburban voters were also more likely than rural voters to have voted absentee or by mail ballot.  2. Republicans opted to not vote because they were told that the election was rigged and that their vote would not count. Donald Trump told his Republican voters for months and months prior to the election that the election would be rigged if he did not win. This is because he had internal polling that showed he was losing the election due to his handling of COVID19. As such Republicans simply did NOT make use of early voting they instead voted on election day. Conversely Democrats overwhelmingly opted to vote by mail.  And here is one last piece of data that might clear up any remaining doubt. Donald Trump did not win in 2016 by the millions and millions of voters that he says he did folks.  FACT Trumps victory was so small in fact that he actually won in 2016 because of 77000 votes in three states Michigan Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Almost three million MORE voters voted for Hillary Clinton. To put this into perspective you could fit all of the people that Trump won the election with into ONE SINGLE SMALL FOOTBALL STADIUM.  Trump isnt spending his money on election fraud claims because he knows there was no election fraud folks.  Extra Credit  Trump has been known to trick people into donating more then they had intended. Although its difficult to pinpoint an exact number of how many people were duped there is a figure that suggests lots of people ended up donating more money than they intended. Trumps campaign refunded 10.7 percent of the money raised on the Republican Partys fundraising platform WinRed. That amounted to around $122 million in online donations in 2020 ALONE.  Trump's own disclaimer notes that Trump may shift campaign-donor money into his private buisnesses.  Thats all.,political,Facebook
New Times Call for New Adaptable and Creative Approaches St Pete Mayoral Race Part 2. By: Jean-Marie Leon  The BayNews9 (#likeBN9) mayoral debate afforded #BodyCams4StPetePD an opportunity to learn about the candidates. Once again here we go with the disclaimer: Our movement is independent and seeks to achieve police accountability with adequate public safety. We hold politicians accountable for their record. Because we value good policing and administration we despise those that use their authority or their office to abuse the public trust. Lets get down to brass tacks. The second segment of the debate is of interest to our movement. We quoted or paraphrased relevant responses followed by my analysis.  First question: Do you believe systemic racism is a problem in the St Petersburg Police Department? Why or Why not?  -Rice: Lets define systemic racism by doing so we can see that we dont need to have racists for systemic racism to exist. The remnants of the racist policies of the past are still present in the justice system today. I am not calling anyone a racist but we have to be honest that certain things that we inherited over the decades. That are here because originally it benefited one group of people over another -Boland: Systemic racism exists but its not a pervasive problem in SPPD. We came a long way with Chief Holloway but theres still more work to do. The worst consequences of a systemic racist policy is the war on drug that led to many black and brown citizens being locked up and robbed of a decent future. We have a lot of great police officers and my plan is to ensure they get all the help they need to continue and improve their public safety work and eventually have a police department that is the model for policing. -Ingram: I believe the most important thing for the police department is accountability. Systemic racism exists on all levels of the US. We need to address it before we experience it. The real question is not whether it exists or not but that there is no home at any levels in our city. -Welch: 30 years ago I wrote an article being profiled in Largo and that is still going on today. I attended 6 meetings about the 18 murders that occurred on the South Side. More conversations are needed. -Blackmon: Systemic racism is not an issue in our police department. SPPD is one of the most diverse police departments in the country. He finished by talking about crime issues in the black communities.  Second question: St Pete has recently experienced an alarming number of shooting deaths what do you contribute this violence to? And how would you address it as mayor?  -Rice: The main factor that contributed to the rise of violent deaths in St Pete were related to the health and economic crisis. We need to provide mental health to those in need by removing the stigma associated with Mental Health and as Mayor I will work with our multiple partners that provide mental health services. -Boland: Some of it are the consequences of the lock down the economic despair the achievement gap the literacy rate is lower in South St Pete but there is also financial illiteracy. At the end of the day it all comes down to the failed war on drug. We need to move away from politics as usual and move forward with new ideas. -Welch: We had a private meeting to discuss the issue. Young people were there and they said there is a sense of hopelessness and a lack of foreseeable path to success. -Blackmon: I sponsored a buyback gun program and we need to provide more opportunities for education because thats why these kids are committing those crimes they dont see a future. With that being said Commissioner Welch was in that post for 20 years and the problem got no better under his leadership in South St. Pete -Welchs response: I created an APAD program that prevents people from being arrested for certain minor crimes. Our juvenile diversion program has the highest level of participation and is one of the most successful in the state. (Well get to APAD in my analysis)  Our Analysis. First thing first Michael Ingram the youngest candidate in the field had the best answer when it came to systemic racism. This fact says a lot about our citys future. We are hopeful that the next generation will get it right. Well done Sir Ingram!  Ken Welch: The most important tool needed to improve our collective situation is a system that can document all interactions with Police Officers after you were profiled 30 years ago. The sense of hopelessness that the black youth feel today is a direct product of these programs that seek to keep our citizens in the justice system instead of ensuring adequate safeguards to prevent it instead. The Adult Pre-Arrest Diversion (APAD) and Diversion bring a lot of resentment when you were wrongly arrested and/or treated.  As promised lets address the APAD program that this candidate has been preaching as a success. On the surface APAD prevents you from being arrested and dealing with the stigma that comes with an arrest. In principle that is a good thing but as with everything in the legal system it was not made to benefit the masses. To all the other candidates running to be mayor shame on you for not doing your research. APAD is the biggest opportunity-limiting for adults and best cost reduction program for the justice system at the expense of the citizens.  We are quoting the county website: [The APAD program was developed to decrease the number of people booked into the Pinellas County Jail and prosecuted within the Pinellas County Criminal Court System. It commenced operation on October 17th 2016. Avoiding the costly expense associated with incarceration and court proceedings was a significant factor that motivated local governmental officials to start the Adult Pre-Arrest Diversion Program. Pinellas officials justify the program in part by contending that it will keep people who commit certain offenses from having a criminal record that could interfere with their future employment acceptance into academic institutions and avoid housing or occupational licensing problems. You should not be misled into believing that records of your admission to the crime and participation in the APAD program do not exist and will therefore be unavailable to the public. To the contrary in order to effectively administer the APAD program the Pinellas County Sheriffs Office is required to maintain a database of participants. Without such a database they would for example be unable to determine how many times you have participated in the APAD program or whether your failure to complete the program in the past makes you automatically disqualified to participate in the future. Currently Florida Statutes Section 943.0585 and 943.059 and Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.692 govern the sealing and expungement of criminal records. No provision of law has been enacted to enable the sealing or expungement of records associated with Pinellas Countys APAD Program. Florida Statute Section 119.01(1) provides that It is the policy of this state that all state county and municipal records are open for personal inspection and copying by any person. Thus although your involvement with law enforcement will not be reflected on an FCIC or NCIC rap sheet a public records request made to the police agency who issued you the notice of referral or to the PCSO who administers the APAD program would reveal information about your case.]  Mr. Welch is taking credit for a program that mostly benefits the justice system while limiting the citizens potential. You see once you accept this deal and claim responsibility in return your record is forever available to the public. It cant be sealed or expunged. If you knew this fact would you have taken the deal specifically if you were mistreated? How many of you brothers and sisters thought after hearing Mr. Welch s claim of APAD I am out of this contact with the police without any damages until they apply for a job apartment or a business license that they rightfully deserve and they are turned down. Anyone can literary make a public record request for all your names and your crimes at any time. The violence we experience in South St Pete is a consequence of so many bad interactions with the police and lack of opportunities as a result. Mr. Welch even said in the referenced debate that the main feedback he received from his private meeting is that the youth feel hopeless without a path to success. Some candidates Rice and Boland running for the office did not need a private meeting to come up to this conclusion. A quick look at his campaign finance donations show the same Trump supporters that are donating to Blackmon are also donating to Mr. Welch in record number. My biggest disappointment with the candidate he was racially profiled 30 years ago and we still are today. What have you done to stop racially motivated arrests? He praised the Sheriff for adopting the same useless bodycam system that SPPD adopted. We wonder why after the Sheriff resisted accountability for decades and all of a sudden he had no issue adopting bodycams. The bodycams system is made for their benefits just like APAD. This is the farce that career politicians play that bothers me. He has been in office for 20 years and has yet to produce a balance approach to public safety crime and punishment and police accountability. Public safety should not be done at the sole expense of minority groups and poor citizens. Just as police accountability should not be done at the expense of good police officers.  Onto the next opportunist: Robert Blackmon is so far the obvious Trumper in the race. He would like you to believe that systemic racism is no longer an issue in SPPD. This is a headscratcher. However when you are financed by the Trump machine red meat is the name of the game. How can this racial issues denier white washer and whataboutism puppet fix our racial divide and heal us? Privilege is writing your own narrative unchallenged so you dont have to acknowledge uncomfortable facts. Systemic racism is still a problem in SPPD may be better but not gone. The latest race riot in St. Pete took place in 1996. Whats next the Courageous 12 of SPPD is a myth. This candidates claim that SPPD is one of the most diverse police departments in the country is false. SPPD does not even come close. The last graduating class as of this writing of 14 SPPD officers 12 were white men. Such chicanery.  Pete Boland: We had not heard of Pete until this debate. We were fortunate that we could seat down and talk about his campaign at one of his establishments. Our first question to him: Why are you running? According to Pete he is running only after candidates he felt should be in the race declined to run. He did not see his republican values reflected in any of the candidates. Pete is a successful businessman who had his own issues with the law and overcame them. Pete will tell you that if he were not white maybe this would not be possible. The candidate is down-to-earth well liked and thumped at the same rhythm as downtown St. Pete. What we like about Pete is his sincerity about the issues and his unpolished language. He is currently the only candidate that is actively and publicly talking about a balanced approach to public safety and police reform. Petes vision for SPPD is a well-paid well-taken-care-of and well-monitored police department. He wants SPPD to be the envy of all police departments in the nation. He reminds our group of Eric Adams approach to policing. Pete speaks the common mans language and we believe the St. Pete republicans are putting their money on the wrong candidate.  Darden Rice: At this point her vision for the city is fully in focus. That vision is not quite well framed when it comes to a concrete plan that she will enact for a balance approach to public safety and police accountability. We believe that she can move in a balance way to bring accountability while ensuring that every good officers are well taking care of and our streets are safe.  In that context we are asking an open question to the candidates that acknowledge the existence of systemic racism in SPPD. Frankly this question should have been framed in that way months ago by our media. It should not be a contrast of Do you believe systemic racism exists in SPPD? vs How will you handle violent crimes in the city? Heres our question lets see who will be brave enough to answer it: The police reform effort created many divisions within police departments city halls neighborhoods and cities. We see a disengagement from law enforcement officers that fed a rise in violent crimes throughout the country. As Mayor how would you balance public safety and police accountability in St. Pete?,political,Facebook

A BLOW FOR IMMIGRATION AND GOVERNMENTAL REFORM  A federal District Court in Houston has struck down the Obama Administrations Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and its companion for parents of those children. Specifically it held that the program was an administrative rule making required to follow the notice and comment process of the federal Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The failure of the Obama Administration to follow this process rendered the program illegal. CNN helpfully included a copy of the Order and Opinion of the court here. The decision is not only a step towards effective immigration reform but also strikes a blow against the power of the administrative state.  The court essentially took up the issues ignored in the US Supreme Courts Regents of the University of California opinion previously discussed here. This decision struck down the attempted rescission of the DACA program by the Trump Administration as itself violating the APA while glossing over the illegalities in the original rulemaking. This new federal court opinion turns the tables and focuses on those infirmities noting that the Supreme Court itself held that DACA was not simply a passive non- enforcement policy. Instead it conferred affirmative immigration relief such as the right to receive a work permit and the right to travel abroad without permission. It did so despite admitting in the original memorandum that only the Congress could confer affirmative immigration relief. The district courts opinion built on Justice Clarence Thomass dissent in the Regents opinion by highlighting the real reason for the program  the inability of successive Presidents to unite the Congress and country around an immigration bill that included effective limits and enforcement as well as the necessary relief for longtime residents.  The district court was mindful of the hardships an immediate cessation of the program would cause to current participants and simply prohibited further expansion of the program for the time being. The Biden Administration has announced that it will appeal the order and urged Congress to pass a bill fixing the problem. The administrations latter position is correct. Both political parties need to look beyond the twin corruptions of identity politics and corporate contributions to pass a comprehensive immigration reform legalizing the status of the Dreamers and creating real enforceable limits on future immigration as I advocated in this post. A truly comprehensive answer to the immigration crisis would be a new beginning for insuring the American Dream for both lifetime citizens and immigrants alike.

#LettersInSupportOfVillanueva  To the Los Angeles Times editor: Villanueva has committed the sin of rebuking a Democrat. How dare he accuse Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti of an inept response to the homelessness crisis? (Except that its true.)  Villanueva ran for office in 2018 at a time of heightened anti-Trump sentiment. Then-Sheriff Jim McDonnell was perceived as collaborating with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement or ICE when the Trump administration was conducting surprise raids in L.A. County.  Villanueva vowed to throw ICE out of county jails if elected. He won the election and has indeed banned inmate transfers to ICE custody.  Villanueva is direct confrontational and all over the map politically. He has publicly celebrated Pride Month but at the other end of the political spectrum he has promised to allow more permits for carrying concealed guns.  He seems to be a maverick rather than an ideological loyalist. If that bothers progressives who expect loyalty to their agenda they had better find someone else.

Good morning everybody! As the deadline for Congressional re-districting closes in this page will be more active to educate our fans about projections to the House and Senate ratings for next years primaries. We know that Texas will have 40 electoral votes (yes FOURTY!) which means two new Congressional districts added to Texas. The seats we see flipping in TX based on Biden's approval rating and his handling of immigration issues are:  TX-15 (Central Hidalgo to Guadalupe county) TX-34 (Southeast Hidalgo to Dewitt county) TX-7 (West Houston and suburbs like River Oaks and Memorial) The GOP needs 4 seats to re-take the house and TX could be key.  Were going to begin talking about the Virginia and New Jersey Governors races. Can a Trump Republican in those states manage to lead a strong coalition to victory or will it take a more moderate candidate to reach across the aisle to connect enough voters? Also we will being running regression models according to Census models to predict voting behaviors and demographic changes. Stay tuned as we follow up with the news!!,political,Facebook

SATIRE: President Trump was the worst dictator in history. He was a terrible dictator ! Dictators control the media in all forms & with Trump it was the exact opposite ! The fake & fraudulent MSM controlled the news & used misinformation & propaganda the entire time he was in office against Trump ! A competent dictator would have shut them down & destroyed them. Not this one. Dictators destroy the opposition & silence them but the exact opposite happened with Trump. The opposition literally tore him apart with lies & hoaxes & even mobilizing rioters & violent anarchists to destroy his presidency. Dictators use force to crush such anarchy but Trump never even thought of doing that ! They looted and destroyed private & public property for months in a row. Dictators always stay in power by cheating in the polls & voting systems & rigging elections. The exact opposite happened with Trump they rigged & stole the election from him. This failed & incompetent  dictator  was cheated lied about bombarded with fake news & hoaxes targeted by top government agencies like the FBI & the CIA & the DOJ to name a few. This terrible dictator was fraudulently & innocently impeached twice ! Pelosi & team make great dictators. If you want to be a good dictator learn from her ! She even knows how to use a pandemic for power. Real professional dictators are a threat to anyone that opposes them but in this case the threatened was Trump. This dictator was so incompetent as a dictator that social media banned & silenced him not the other way around. They silenced almost 100 million followers of his with zero resistance .A true & tried dictator controls the media the police the armed forces the means of communication the courts and all branches of government. A true dictator destroys all opposition & critics & criticism. But no not Trump ! He knew nothing about dictatorship ! A true & loyal dictator  loyal to dictators & dictatorship would have annihilated these social media opposition dictators. Finally dictators come in with the use of force & if they ever leave its by the use of force or death. Trump failed in that category too because he was  elected. He left because the other side cheated him by force & destruction. There are many other dictator requirements & qualities for a good dictator that Trump lacked ! However One last dictator quality worth mentioning that Trump lacked: Dictators come usually very poor & without much wealth & become enormously rich in office. Richer than most people in their country.  Trump is the only dictator in history who came in rich but left less rich !

A copy of the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights hang in the waiting room of my office. All attorneys seeking admission to the New Jersey State Bar must sign an oath to support the Constitution of the United States and the State of New Jersey. As one of the original 13 colonies New Jersey representatives signed the Declaration which was adopted on July 4th 1776 and reads as follows:  When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights that among these are Life Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.  That to secure these rights Governments are instituted among Men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed  That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it and to institute new Government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to affect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence indeed will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such Government and to provide new Guards for their future security.  Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. . . .  The Declaration than goes on to list the grievances suffered by the colonies at the hands of the King of England which drove them to seek independence. The signers pledged their lives fortunes and Sacred Honor to support the Declaration relying on the protection of Divine Providence.  Why did the founders use the term all men are created equal given that slavery was legal in the colonies as it has been throughout the world during various stages of history? Racial activists such as Nikole Hannah-Jones and Ibram X. Kendi contend that the white men who drafted the Declaration did not believe their own words and that America was built on a lie. What they fail to recognize is that the founders established equality and freedom as pillars for the country to strive towards in signing the Declaration. These white men maligned by Jones and Kendi risked being charged with treason for which the penalty was death to establish an independent nation founded on the very principles which led to the abolition of slavery.  From the settlement of the first colony America has been a beacon of hope initially for Pilgrims who sought to escape religious persecution to the present day in which immigrants flock here to seek economic opportunity. Thomas Jefferson denounced slavery in the original draft of the Declaration of Independence indicating that it was a morally repugnant practice brought to the new world by King George. The text regarding slavery was removed to gain the approval of the southern colonies without which the United States would never have been formed. However Jeffersons use of the phrase all men are created equal served as a powerful springboard to ultimately abolishing human bondage in this country.  Like the human beings which inhabit it America is imperfect struggling to reach its goals sometimes succeeding occasionally failing but always striving to be better. Approximately three-quarters of a million Americans died in a Civil War less than 100 years after signing of the Declaration of Independence to end the horror of slavery. After the Civil War African Americans continued to suffer from oppression particularly in the then Democrat-controlled South under Jim Crow laws which segregated the races and enshrined discrimination. Progress could not be stopped though. Whites and blacks served together in the military fighting two World Wars. They marched and bled together in the 1960s to force the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The aptly named Supreme Court decision of Loving vs. Virginia was issued in 1967 striking down state laws which banned interracial marriages. The 1970s marked the start of the post-civil rights movement era during which African Americans made great strides in academia business and politics. In 1983 Martin Luther King Day was declared the first new federal holiday since the 1940s by President Reagan. During his tenure from 1993 - 2001 President Clinton focused on issues of equality and issued an apology to the families of 399 black men impacted by the Tuskegee syphilis experiment in which the public health service failed to inform them of their diagnosis or provide them with treatment for syphilis to study the long-term effects of the disease. President George W. Bush appointed more people of color to top-tier cabinet roles than any other president naming General Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice to lead the State Department among other cabinet members. Americans of all races creeds and colors came together in solidarity after the tragedy of 9-11. In 2008 we elected our first black President Barack Obama who was re-elected to a second term in 2012. In 2018 President Trump signed a prison reform law which had been lobbied for by civil rights leaders for years. One year later President Trump pledged that the federal government would permanently provide funding of more than $250 million annually to the nations historically black universities. In short our county has made incredible progress towards the goal of upholding equality and liberty for all.  Opportunists such as Jones and Kendi ignore the enormous advancements made in race relations over the past 150 years and seek to demonize America in the present day for long-ago outlawed crimes against humanity. According to the Center for Global Justice there are as many as forty million people still living in various forms of bondage today including domestic servitude forced labor child labor debt bondage forced marriage human trafficking and descent-based slavery in other parts of the world. Yet it is only America which continues to be labeled by some as systemically racist.  Why focus on America when the evil of slavery still exists in the world? Because the United States is a shining example of the success of capitalism which has raised more people out of abject poverty than any other political or economic system. Given the high standards of living in the United States Americans have never developed a strong sense of class consciousness. Most citizens believe in the American dream: that one can transcend their origins through hard work. It was thus difficult for Marxist intellectuals to agitate for a workers revolution here. Now neo-Marxists are taking another crack at it by implementing critical theories which uses several intersectional groups rather than economic class as a method of dividing citizens for the purpose of deconstructing classical liberal Western institutions and replacing them with an atheist Marxist value system.  Critical race theory known as CRT is an insidious legal hypothesis which has been festering and growing in our universities since the early 1980s. It instructs people to view the world entirely through a lens of race. Under CRT it is unacceptable to be color-blind  the most important characteristic of an individual is their skin color under this theory and individuals are seen as members of either the oppressed or oppressor class. It also suggests that people of color lack agency to forge their own destiny cruelly undermining their confidence by labeling them as perpetual victims.  The adherents of CRT do not hide their true goal. One of the promoters of this mindset Ibram X. Kendi openly states In order to truly be antiracist you also have to truly be anti-capitalist. The aim of CRT not simply to teach a complete and accurate history of the injustices which occurred in the United States. Rather the goal is to divide us as a country to facilitate the tearing down our core institutions including capitalism to create an unattainable utopian vision of absolute equity.  CRT is not the only critical theory gaining in popularity  it is part of the larger Critical Social Justice movement which divides society into different groups based upon race gender ethnicity sexual preference and disability. According to Critical Social Justice straight white people (men in particular) are oppressors who must be shunned. Purveyors of the critical theories believe in the collective guilt of all members of the supposed oppressor class regardless of their individual innocence and encourage separate spaces for people of color. In other words these theories make generalizations based upon immutable characteristics  exactly the type of discrimination the civil rights movement sought to stamp out. Such segregation and collective guilt violate the basic principles of justice and equality enshrined in the Constitution and undermines our strength as one nation.  It is undeniable that there are still ignorant people in the world who are racists sexists and homophobic. Such discrimination was outlawed long ago and we must continue to fight against it wherever it rears its ugly head. Civil rights attorneys around the country are prepared to file lawsuits against on behalf of victims and to overturn any laws or policies which discriminate based on an immutable characteristic. However doing battle against specific instances of injustice is a far different proposition than dividing all of society by hierarchies of intersectional groups for the purpose of tearing down our institutions.  The Critical Social Justice movement uses the buzz word equity in the curriculum it has been pushing on corporations and educational institutions. The term seems to be an innocuous and even laudable goal for society. However it requires a deeper analysis to understand why it is not. The American founding fathers specifically used the term equality rather than equity in the Declaration and Constitution. While the words sound similar their meanings are very different. Equality under the law refers to the protection of the rights of the individual. By contrast those who seek equity are concerned with collective groups of people and believe that justice is only achieved when every group has attained the same outcome as opposed to being provided the same opportunity. Regardless of their skin color religion gender or sexual orientation all individuals have unique skill sets intelligence levels natural talents upbringings social financial advantages/disadvantages and aspirations. Absolute equity of outcome is thus virtually impossible to track. It is even harder to achieve.  Since absolute equity can never occur naturally it may only be attained by sheer force  taking from one individual and giving it to another. It is therefore the antithesis of the traditional American notion of equality and freedom -- and will necessarily result in totalitarianism. The Marxist goal of equity attributes malice to all members of the supposed oppressor class with or without evidence and requires active discrimination based on skin color and/or sexual orientation to alleviate unproven discrimination. Massive government power would thus be necessary to achieve equity through race-based redistribution of wealth active discrimination suppression of free speech of those who disagree and omnipotent bureaucratic authority to carry it out.  The American experiment started with the principal that all men were endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights meaning that our rights emanate from God by virtue of our membership in the human race. Our rights to life liberty and happiness are thus not granted by any government. In Federalist paper no. 51 James Madison pointed out that if men were angels no government would be necessary. Since the potential for evil runs through every human heart it is necessary to establish law administered by government to protect citizens from one another and secure our rights. However we must always guard against the government gaining too much power especially in the hands of unelected bureaucrats who are not accountable to the people. If those who believe in the Marxist goal of equity continue to accrue power in our government I fear that citizens who believe in individual rights and responsibilities will seek to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their security. Let us hope that this drastic step is unnecessary so that America may continue being that bright shining city on the hill providing freedom and prosperity to all.

"Twitter thread from David Rothkopf (@djrothkopf) expresses the frustration that I feel. Do you agree?  ""Donald Trump sold out the country to our greatest enemy raped or abused two dozen women defrauded the federal government for years serially obstructed justice violated his oath and orchestrated a coup attempt. And we're still dealing with marginal charges against his staff.  Hundreds of thousands of Americans died and tens of millions suffered because of the criminal malfeasance of this man in managing a pandemic the most costly and damaging set of decisions ever by a US president and we are debating the tax implications of his CFO's car.  No American president has ever been more corrupt committed more crimes committed crimes of such a serious degree caused suffering among so many Americans because of his crimes and we're wondering about the tax consequences of how his accountant got his apartment.  That is among the most galling aspects of Trump's life. Not only has he so regularly & egregiously violated the law but he has gotten away with it all of it & he is still doing so. There are kids in jail for stealing loaves of bread and this career criminal lives in luxury.

Typical of career corrupt politicians. Congressman Palazzo has been touting his term limit bill since he went to Congress. If he abided by the bill he has submitted numerous times his term would be up in 2022. Like most politicians they only say things to get elected. If he was honorable he would retire after his twelfth year. We know that like most career corrupt politicians he won't because he can't give up the power and money.  Press Releases Palazzo Re-Introduces Term Limits Bill f t # e Washington January 5 2017 | 0 comments Washington DC  Congressman Steven Palazzo (MS-4) re-introduced his legislation today H. J. Res. 17 that would impose term limits on Members of the House and Senate. The bill would limit members of Congress to twelve years of service six terms in the House or two terms in the Senate.  I personally believe our nation would be much better off if there were no career politicians. That is why I have introduced a term limits bill for the last three Congresses that forces politicians to go back home and live under the same laws they created knowing they will likely do less damage to our country and work more to improve the lives of hardworking Americans.  President-elect Trump and I are in complete agreement on the fact that we should have term limits in place. However my legislation allows lawmakers in both chambers to serve twelve years in order to ensure the balance of powers among the two institutions as specified in our Constitution. ,political,Facebook

I know damn well this will make absolutely no difference to all of you deluded people who hold onto the totally false allegations that Trump won the election but his most loyal cabinet member just came out against it.

"Class is in session. Stand. Pledge. Sit. Topic: Critical race theory.  I have had quite a few people messaging me to ask questions about what critical race theory (CRT) is. As you know I have been taking a bit of a break but I wanted to go ahead and research the topic so I could report back and actually have the facts.  What is critical race theory?  Critical race theory quite simply is the study of how racism is embedded in American laws and institutions. Specifically its core idea is that racism is a social construct that is not only the product of individuals and their own biases but it is also something that is embedded in legal systems and policies. It includes the study of political power social organization and language.  Where did race theory come from?  Critical race theory was a framework for legal analysis in the ladder part of the 1970s and into the early part of the 1980s created by legal scholars Derrick Bell Kimberle (yes with an e) Crenshaw and Richard Delgado.  In the early 1980s students of color at Harvard Law School organized protests regarding Harvard's lack of racial diversity in the curriculum among students and in the faculty. These students supported Professor Derrick Bell who left Harvard Law in 1980 and then became the dean at University of Oregon School of Law. During his time at Harvard Bell had developed new courses that studied American law through a racial lens. Harvard students of color wanted faculty of color to teach the new courses in his absence. Bell resigned his position at Harvard because of what he viewed as the university's discriminatory practices.  Can you give me an example?  Sure. In the 1930s for instance government officials literally drew lines around certain areas deemed to be poor financial ricks most often specifically for the racial composition of its inhabitants. Banks would often times refuse to offer mortgages to the African Americans in these areas. Today these policies still exist via policies like single family zoning that prevents the building of affordable housing in advantages neighborhoods that majority white.  This academic understanding of critical race theory differs from representation in recent popular books and especially from its portrayal by criticsoften though not exclusively conservative Republicans. Critics charge that the theory leads to negative dynamics such as a focus on group identity over universal shared traits; divides people into oppressed and oppressor groups; and urges intolerance (Sawchuk 2021).  Give me another example.  Absolutely! Take the landmark case Brown v. Board of Education for example in which the Supreme Court ruled in 1954 that separate is not equal and that state laws protecting segregated public schools are unconstitutional. While the ruling gave Black children the right to attend schools that had long prohibited them it also resulted in some white families enrolling their children in private schools moving to the suburbs or redrawing school district boundaries in an effort to resist integration.  What does this have to do with our schools?  Scholars who study CRT in education examine how policies and practices in K-12 education are a contributor to persistent racial inequalities in matters such as education and advocate ways to change them. Topics of study include racially segregated schools underfunding of majority black and latino school districts barriers to gifted programs and selective admission high schools. Many educators support culturally relevant teaching and other strategies to make schools feel safe and supporting for African American students and other underserved populations. However these educators do not necessarily identify these activities as CRT related.  Critical race theory is NOT taught in K-12 schools instead it is taught in law schools.  Can you just lay it on the table for me?  Sure. A recent poll by the advocacy group Parents Defending Education claimed some schools were teaching that white people are inherently privileged while Black and other people of color are inherently oppressed and victimized; that achieving racial justice and equality between racial groups requires discriminating against people based on their whiteness; and that the United States was founded on racism. Thus much of the current debate appears to spring not from the academic texts but from fear among critics that studentsespecially white studentswill be exposed to supposedly damaging or self-demoralizing ideas.  Why Are People Talking About Critical Race Theory and the 1619 Project Right Now?  The term critical race theory began gaining traction in the mainstream two years ago  or notoriety depending on people's outlook  after The New York Times published the 1619 Project a compilation of essays commentaries and poems that brought the idea of critical race theory out of academia for the first time by asking readers to center the consequences of slavery and the contributions of Black Americans in the country's national narrative.  The project's orchestrator Nikole Hannah-Jones won a Pulitzer Prize for the moving personal essay she wrote  the introduction to the package  about her father a veteran and why he flew an American flag in their front yard and was proud to be American when what she saw as a little girl was a country that used and then abandoned him.  While the project was widely hailed it also irked many people who argued that it put ideology before historical accuracy as well as a handful of prominent academic scholars who challenged some of the package's guiding principles including that colonists fought the Revolutionary War in order to preserve slavery and that slavery was a uniquely American enterprise.  Political conservatives in particular found the darker portrayal of America's origins and its shortcomings galling saying that it undercut patriotism and had a divisive effect. Former President Donald Trump found it especially insulting. ""Critical race theory the 1619 Project and the crusade against American history is toxic propaganda ideological poison that if not removed will dissolve the civic bonds that tie us together will destroy our country"" he said about it at the time. Months following the 1619 Project's publication Trump convened the ""1776 Commission"" to counter the narrative and develop a ""patriotic"" curriculum that schools can use to teach U.S. history. The commission published a 41-page report two days before the end of the Trump administration which concluded among other things that progressivism is at odds with American values and recommended that schools teach positive stories about the country's founders (Camera 2021).  I heard this is something called a wedge issue. What is that?  A wedge issue is a political or social issue often of a controversial or divisive nature which splits apart a demographic or population group. Wedge issues can be advertised or publicly aired in an attempt to strengthen the unity of a population with the goal of enticing polarized individuals to give support to an opponent or to withdraw their support entirely out of disillusionment. The use of wedge issues gives rise to wedge politics. Wedge issues are also known as hot button or third rail issues.  Who came up with this?  This issue has been developed primarily by a man named Christopher Rufo. Rufo is an American conservative activist and the director of several documentary films. ... He is known for his activism against CRT which he says ""has pervaded every aspect of the federal government"" poses ""an existential threat to the United States"" and is anti-American.  Why is he making such an issue out of this?  Because it is divisive. Rufo says the goal is to have the public read something crazy in the newspaper and immediately think critical race theory. We have to codify the term and reccodify it to annex the entire range of cultural constructions that are unpopular with America. We will eventually turn it toxic as we put all of the various cultural under that brand category.  That is what this is all about ladies and gentleman.

I want to talk a little bit about election security and Voter Id. More dangerous ground as what I am about to say is likely to annoy both sides. First of all I do not think President Trump lost the last election due to voter fraud. I think his behavior (not his policies) just alienated too many independent voters he needed to repeat his win from 2016. I have researched and researched for any sign of proof of enough fraud to affect this election and have not found any. Add to that Sydney Powells claim that no one would reasonably believe her claim of voting machine fraud that it was only political speech and I just do not see any proof. I am not from Missouri but am very much a show me kind of guy. I want to see the proof and make my own decisions over people telling me what to believe.  Secondly the potential for fraud and abuse in our elections are very much real and we need to be proactive to address it and yes one of these actions means voter IDs. If anything this last election has shown how vulnerable our election system is to doubt being created. These are things that our adversaries will use in the future through misinformation campaigns and psychological operations to create doubt in our constitutional republic system of democracy and to further divide Americans. If we are too busy fighting ourselves we cannot take care of ourselves and our country.  For whatever reason close to half of the country has lost faith in the security of our election system I think restoring that faith is well worth the cost and should be treated like any other threat to our nation.  With all of this being said I do not see either the Republicans or the Democrats being serious about fixing this issue they are both using it to their advantage at the expense of our country. I base this on a simple observation.  From the Republican side if they were really concerned about voter IDs they would take the democratic claim of disenfranchisement and address it. Any security measure we take will cost money. If the Government will require an ID to secure an election then the Government should pay for it and provide it once. If a ID is stolen it could be replaced with a police report to show it was actually stolen. Grants can be established to help pay to get the required documentation (or we could just make it simple with a $100 credit per dependent on next years taxes). Lets say the total cost would average $100 per person. With somewhere over 330 million people you would be looking at $33 billion dollars. Sorry world securing our elections is more important then your aid packages (2019 we sent over $39 billion in foreign aid). For most of us that already have a government issued ID the cost would be much lower than $100.  From the Democrat side they have long had the practice of throwing money at any little problem if they were truly worried about disenfranchisement they would have come up with my recommendation above a long time ago and told the Republicans to put their money where their mouth is. With the mammoth infrastructure bill President Biden is pushing you really think they would not have found $33 billion to put in there if this were a real concern of theirs?  Election security is just another issue the establishments are using to fire up their bases at the potential risk to our country. Voter IDs are just one piece of the picture when it comes to election security but it seems to be the one everyone is talking about.  I will leave you with one last set of figures. $33 billion for Voter Ids or $10 billion to Jeff Bezos so he can get awarded a contract he actually lost? You decide American Voter Security or Corporate welfare.,political,Facebook
"Kamala Harris was interviewed this week on her trip to Guatemala. During the interview she blatantly lied when asked if she'd been to the border saying ""we've been to the border"".

We can understand why you haven't been to Europe Kamala you weren't tapped by the President to lead the response to the European border crisis. What we can't understand is how you were tapped to address the crisis at our southern border more than 75 days ago and you STILL haven't visited it.

Dear Senator Joe Manchin III   I recently had a heart-breaking conversation with my father that has caused me to reach out to you. Hes been practicing as an emergency medical physician for more than forty years an impressive feat for a Black man raised in the era of Jim Crow. The recent renewed efforts to silence Black Americans caused him to reach this conclusion:  Son it looks like Jim Crow is coming back and well have to find a way to live with it.  The resignation in his voice revealed a deep sense of dismay for his country and fear for his grandchildrens future. The last time I heard him speak with such unbearable sadness was at my mothers funeral in 1998. He is a moderate democrat much like yourself and while his experience of America differs greatly from your own he would agree with your words below:  The right to vote is fundamental to our American democracy and protecting that right should not be about party or politics.  In this regard you and I have a common understanding: every American has a constitutional right to participate in this democracy. However determining the necessary actions of protecting these rights is where we differ. While one might feel that a bipartisan compromise is the only way to preserve our nation one cannot bargain with politicians who actively work to suppress the historically disenfranchised to protect the Republican influence of their respective states.  In late May you said that you needed ten good people (Republicans) for you to vote in favor of the For the People Voting Rights Act. Though you were not specific one could assume that you were referring to those who voted for President Trumps impeachment.  Rep. Peter Meijer R-Mich.; Rep. David Valadao R-Calif.; Rep. Dan Newhouse R-Wash.; Rep. John Katko R-N.Y.; Rep. Adam Kinzinger R-Ill.; Rep. Jamie Herrera Beutler R-Wash.;Rep. Tom Rice R-S.C.; Fred Upton R-Mich.; Rep. Anthony Gonzalez R-Ohio; Liz Cheney R-Wyo.  While it certainly took courage to vote against their party leader I cannot share in your optimism. Throughout the United States most notably in the southern states voter suppression laws are being passed and considered by Republican legislature determined to silence non-white and impoverished voices. In particular Michigan Wyoming and Ohio - the resident states of three aforementioned good people - are all considering further ways to restrict access to registration and polling places. Even the recently censured Representative Liz Cheney has demonstrated support for some of these restrictive practices.  Whats further troubling is the lacking specificity in your critique of the For the People Voting Rights Act. Although you oppose the partisan appearance of the act you do not cite anything that is wrong with the bill itself. After reviewing your website and media appearances I could not find a critique of the elements in the bill.  The For the People Voting Rights Act would modernize voter registration increase secure access to the ballot box ensure flexibility for those who must vote early or absentee and increase the participation of Americans in our democracy. However rather than point out flaws or debate the nature of these elements your main point of contention is that not enough Republicans agree. I am left to assume that you know the bill is the right thing for the country but will only support it if there is bipartisan support.  I point to your vote in favor of the January 6th Commission. Despite not having ten brave Republicans you voted in favor of the commission and made the following statement:  Choosing to put politics and political elections above the health of our Democracy is unconscionable. And the betrayal of the oath we each take is something they will have to live with.  These should be the words of a man who does what is right even when he does not have the support from his peers.  Senator Manchin America cannot wait for ten good Republicans. Since 2020 legislatures in 47 states have been presented with 361 bills with restrictive voter provisions. Many of the good Republicans youre waiting on have supported these restrictive bills fought the 2020 census or questioned the integrity of the previous election.  Refusing to support this voting rights bill will force many Americans to choose between work and exercising their vote; limit the number of available polling places; deny funding to upgrade electoral commissions and systems; and further the silence of poor and minority Americans  These actions to target and silence non-white Americans are not unfamiliar nor are the legislative tools used. While you believe the filibuster is integral for compromise it has long been wielded as a whip to silence Black representation. John C. Calhoun used the filibuster so effectively to protect slavery that his bigoted predecessors did not hesitate to use it against the Dyer Anti-lynching BIll (1922); the Civil Rights Act of 1957; and again in 1964.  To put it concisely Senator one cannot compromise with a party that believes in the lie of a stolen election. One should not compromise for the sake of appearing bipartisan for that would be sacrificing the voting rights of Americans to placate a false concern of election integrity. That is not compromise that is appeasement for the only beneficiaries in this illusion of compromise are Republicans seeking the favor of a shadow president and not the American people.

Former presidents have a history of taking on a cause to help the country. FORMER President Donald J Trump has a unique opportunity to do something that would help get our country past the devastation and economic problems caused by the pandemic. A significant number of Americans many of them Trump supporters are hesitant to get the vaccines that would get our country to herd immunity. Trump has shown through his bragging about the vaccines and the fact he and Melanie both got vaccinated that he does not share much of the anti vaccine sentiment as many of his followers. If he would enthusiastically encourage his followers to get vaccinated through PSAs and rallies we could maybe reach herd immunity in a few months. Because this might alienate some of his base he would also be showing political courage as well making America great again.,political,Facebook

In fact a correlation has been shown by some studies but not others. The article linked below says its too soon to tell if Vitamin D can help to prevent COVID: there's no firm evidence that vitamin D supplements curb people's risk of infection or serious Covid-19 illness.

Many Green Card Holders got that status by marrying US citizens. Many have US citizen children. None of them are here illegally. This guys bill were it to become law would block even those Green Card Holders from receiving federal help of any kind. It should also be noted that actual illegal immigrants are already prohibited from receiving most welfare benefits except for WIC & a few emergency relief programs.

Cults among us checklist!  1. They micromanage your life. You are not allowed to make decisions without their approval. 2. Their word trumps your personal relationship with God and your ability to hear Him for yourself. 3. They make it seem like they are the only ones with a certain revelation or movement of God. 4. They decreasingly minister elsewhere and invest most of their energy in building their own platform. This is because... 5. They say everyone wont receive them. In actuality everyone will not receive their lack of character/fruit of the Spirit. 6. They demand you sacrifice for them. Money time excessive services/events/lives. You dont give as you feel led you give as they demand. 7. They publicly humiliate you. Anyone who makes a mistake or does anything that doesnt jive with how they do things is fair game. 8. They encourage people to spy and tattle/report on the words and actions of other members. This includes monitoring people whove left the ministry. 9. Its more like a police state or plantation than a ministry. 10. There is an unhealthy and excessive emphasis on honour. The problem is the way they understand honour is actually a form of idolatry. 11. There is an unhealthy and excessive emphasis on submission. And the submission is to them not to God. (See #1 and #2.) 12. Any one who disagrees with them or has a difference of opinion is wrong immature disrespectful unsubmissive rebellious etc. 13. Anyone who calls out an offense or unjust act by the leadership is identified as having a spirit of offense and is spiritually immature. This is because... 14. The founders of the ministry can do no wrong. Their voice is in place of God; they speak for God and if you dont agree then youre not operating in the Spirit of God. 15. Their rules trump the rules of your household. You are supposed to obey and submit to them OVER your spouse as well as any other mentors leaders peers and parents you may have. 16. Any peer or elder who has something to say against them is identified as being jealous or envious of what they believe they have. 17. Any person of lesser rank who has something to say against them is identified as being rebellious rogue or jezebelic. They are also not considered worth listening to because their rank is lesser than the leaders. 18. Only God can check them. This is difficult because it would seem that the god in their head agrees with and approves of everything they say/do. (See #14.) 19. They treat people like trash and call it the anointing. They are controlling/domineering and petty and call it apostolic order. They are mean nasty and manipulative and call it prophetic. 20. They are nice to and spend time with people who can further their platform/agenda give them large amounts of money or make them look good. Not average people or supporters. 21. They have a revolving door of peers associates and subordinates. They are not authentically kind or generous so they can not maintain authentic relationships. (See #4 and #5.) 22. There is supernatural demonstration but little-to-no fruit of the Spirit. 23. They have a ride-or-die loyal following. Even if the people question the leadership they dont dare voice it because... 24. The people are controlled by a spirit of fear. Because the fear of the Lord is equated to the fear of man (the ministry leadership) people are afraid to speak out or leave because they think their calling will be deterred. They think their calling purpose promotion prosperity and miracles are tied to that ministry. Theyve also seen and or participated in the public humiliation of anyone who has spoken up and dont want it to happen to them as well. 25. Anyone who leaves the ministry or speaks against them/their actions has their character assassinated. This is classic jezebelic form: destroying a persons character in order to discredit their voice or ministry. 26. The ministry will release word curses and evil judgments against those who leave their ministry. This is will be particularly prominent if the ministry is in any way threatened by person who left. This is a form of spiritual witchcraft. 27. Anyone who leaves the ministry will be iced out by the ministry and most of their followers. 28. People who leave the ministry have to detox and go through deliverance to break the unhealthy soul ties that were formed and the abuse that was experienced. 29. People who leave the ministry have to tip toe and walk on egg shells around people in the ministry and people who left because they dont know if its safe to talk to them. 30. They control what you can and cannot post as well as what you can and cannot like on social media. 31. They control any spiritual/ministerial influences you listen to. If its not approved by the ministry then according to them you shouldnt listen to it. They want to be the dominant influence in your life above all else - even God. 32.

Recently a friend of mine was defending Liz Cheney and criticizing Trump and those that support Trump which is certainly his right to do.  For me Lizs diagnosis is simply: Liz is suffering from TDS and cannot focus on winning back the house. Personally I support president Trump because he points out weakness which is the primary problem with Republican leaders is the most pro-life president in my lifetime is not using politics for financial gain as many do and although rude and obnoxious at times always puts America and the little guy first. Additionally no other national leader has ever had the courage to demand school choice for every child in America which is critical for those like me who are only concerned for those that will follow us.  For me it is always policy over personality and honesty over slick political rhetoric. I respect who you support whether Liz or anyone else but for the future of mine and everyones children I hope the disruptor in chief trump decides to run again and God willing wins again.,political,Facebook
NOT SIMPLY IRONIC TWISTS OF HISTORY  When Jimmy Carter was President the economic situation was dark four long years. When Carter lost reelection to Ronald Reagan within 100 days of Regans leadership as President the circumstances were getting brighter with each passing day.  When Donald Trump was President the economic situation was bright four long years. When Trump lost reelection to Joe Biden within 100 days of Bidens leadership as President the circumstances have been getting darker with each passing day.  These might seem like ironic twists of history but they arent. They are clear evidence that one approach to leadership and understanding of economic policy works while the other doesnt. One is like spinach to Popeye. The other like kryptonite to Superman.  -Rev. Mark Creech,political,Facebook

Ahora es ms fcil comprar y poseer un arma en Texas que votar. Su derecho a votar ahora est siendo atacado a travs de restricciones que ahora le dicen cmo y cundo puede uno votar. Esto es INACEPTABLE! Est bien que compre un arma en nuestro estado de Texas sin ninguna verificacin de antecedentes pero si va a votar es posible que lo rechacen para fuera. Esta es la estrategia que nuestro lideres han decidido implementar para impedir el voto de la gente de Texas. Obviamente nuestros lderes en Texas son republicanos y estn de acuerdo con reprimir el voto porque DONALD TRUMP PERDI! Esto se ha verificado una y otra vez en procedimientos judiciales tanto federales como estatales en todo el pas.  Es necesario que nos organicemos y establezcamos una presencia en sus comunidades. Les ruego que traten a ponerse en contacto con alguien de una organizacin democrtica en sus comunidades y me dejen saber si hay una presencia donde se encuentran para que podamos ir a ese condado y empezarlos si no hay.

It is now easier to buy and own a gun in Texas than it is to Vote. Your right to vote is now under attack through restrictions that now tell you how and when you can vote. UNACCEPTABLE! It is okay for you to purchase a gun in our state without a background check but if you go vote you may be turned away. This is the strategy that our current leadership has decided to implement to hinder the vote for the people of Texas. Let's state the obvious our top leaders in Texas are Republicans and they are okay with suppressing the vote because DONALD TRUMP LOST! IT'S OVER! This has been verified over and over in both federal and state court proceedings all across the country.  It is vital that we organize and establish a presence in your communities. I urge you to reach out to your communities and let me know if there is a presence where you are so that we can address it. I have been traveling through all 254 counties in Texas and I try to call and send several emails to Democratic organizations in rural counties across Texas and our presence feels nearly obsolete.  Texas grew in population by nearly 5 million since 2010 most of this increase being Hispanics and minorities. This added 2 more congressional seats for Texas. WE HAVE THE POWER TO FLIP TEXAS.

Liz Cheney is possibly the bravest politician in America. She is sacrificing her powerful leadership position to stand up for what is right in denouncing the Big Lie that Trump really won the election. The fact that 70% of the voters in her party believe that lie makes it obvious her party no longer stands for the same values as she does. It is time politicians in the middle separate from the Republicans and Democrats to form a centrist party. Mitt Romney Joe Manchin and many more elected officials could create a strong third party. To the naysayers that say a third party can never make it I have a history lesson for you. In 1860 the US elected a president from a third party founded just 6 years earlier. That party was the Republican Party and that president was Abraham Lincoln.,political,Facebook
The Left likes to attack fossil fuels with false statements. It started in the 1970s with foolish scare tactics that we were running out of oil. To the contrary oil and gas is still one of the cheapest and most widespread forms of energy available namely due to American ingenuity and the policies of the Trump Administration. We as a nation are an exporter of oil a fact which still seems to be inconceivable to those who oppose sound energy policy.  But facts do not seem to matter to the Left. Neither the enormous availability of fossil fuels nor the fact that oil and gas produces good-paying jobs nor the fact that oil and gas is necessary to our functioning as a society seem to matter. It is time to stand up to the harmful measures this Administration plans to implement and say NO to their efforts to take us backwards.,political,Facebook

"U.S. AND RUSSIA  Rising tension between the U.S and Russia should be a cause for concern among all Americans. Although recently the tensions between the nuclear armed powers have slightly eased due to the Russian pullback of troops along the Ukrainian border the general trajectory of the relationship points toward eventual conflict. Only ""the people"" can restrain the movement towards war. To enable this restraint it is perhaps helpful to view U.S.-Russia relations from the Russian perspective. Let me qualify the following by stating that I am not an expert on U.S.-Russia relations; but from a layperson's perspective this is what I see.  Russia has been pushed around by the West since its dissolution in December of 1991. At that time it's state dominated command economy was collapsing and there began a movement towards a free market capitalist system first gradually during the late 1980's under the Soviet leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev then very rapidly under Russia's first democratically elected President Boris Yeltsin.  During the economic collapse of the early 1990's western nation's offered aid to Russia largely through the G7--a group of advanced industrialized nations--and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) contingent on the dismantling of the Russian state dominated economic system. The transformation from the old to the new system within Russia was highly controversial with President Boris Yeltsin pushing for reform while Russia's parliamentary body consisting largely of communist and ultranationalist resisted the rapid transformation. This deeply divided the Nation.  It would be hard to overestimate the hardship this transformation imposed on the Russian people. Widespread homelessness child and adult prostitution increased rates of alcoholism decreased life expectancy all accompanied the transformation to the western style economic model. From 1991-1998 during the western aided transformation Russia's GDP fell nearly 40%. During the 1996 presidential election the G7 and the IMF pumped billions of dollars into the Russian economy in order to salvage a Yeltsin victory from a stiff challenge by a communist opponent: election interference by any measure.  The transformation left deep scars on the Russian people and depending on one's view of the transformation generated resentment against the West. Many among the older generation the intelligentsia and workers longed for a return to Soviet times. Conspiracy theories abound which suggest the West deliberately undermined the Russian state. One argument states that current President Putin's hybrid authoritarian democratic political model where the U.S. currently seems to be headed was an effort to establish order out of the chaos of the 1990's. The U.S. condemns Putin's trend towards authoritarianism but little such condemnation existed in 1993 when U.S. President Clinton supported the free market oriented Yeltsin's unconstitutional dissolution of the Russian parliament which had resisted the transformation to the capitalist model. It is of course possible that Russia would have suffered equal economic hardship had Russia persisted on its state dominated path but this matters little as people were suffering and the suffering was due to the then current transformation process.  During West-East negotiations over the reunification of Germany during 1990 Russian concerns about NATO expansion eastward towards the Russian border were allayed when U.S. Secretary of State James Baker assured the Russians that NATO would not expand ""one inch eastward"" towards the Russian border. By the end of the 1990's decade NATO expanded: eastward to include three former Soviet Republics; since then it has expanded eastward to include eleven more states most former Soviet Republics three of which: Estonia Latvia and Lithuania lie directly on a Russian border. NATO has a working relationship with both Georgia and Ukraine both former Soviet Republics which also lie on the Russian border and both of which are working towards NATO membership. Russians find NATO expansion to its borders as threatening and in breach of Western promises to not expand ""one inch eastward"" towards the Russian border.  Russia's 2014 forceful annexation of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula transferred to Ukraine by Russia during 1954 under former Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev can be seen as an effort to protect both the Russian border as well as the Russian Black Sea fleet partially housed on the Crimean peninsula. Further both Ukraine and Georgia have experienced western friendly coups both with some level of U.S. support.  Most recently in response to continued tensions between Ukraine and Russia the U.S. had threatened to float two naval warships into the Black Sea which would be the equivalent of Russian warships sailing into the Gulf of Mexico. How do you think that might work out?  The former great power undoubtedly feels threatened and humiliated by the above turn of events. Russia views itself as a world power which has been undermined by the neoliberal economic order. Russian bashing among U.S. politicians generally works well across the full political spectrum although somewhat less so among conservatives since Trump; and the U.S. libertarian movement generally opposes international entanglement and war.  There is no effort here to suggest Russia is holier than its western counterparts. Hierarchy is hierarchy and it knows no other way than domination and submission. If the tables were turned perhaps the Russians would act in the same manner. This assuredly is the view of the hierarchical actors who play this nonsensical game. Just as assuredly however there are people in Russia as in the U.S. who desire peace. It is hard for the peacemakers to rise to power when there is so much turmoil in the world. To even speak of peace is often viewed as naive. If in the U.S a significant peace movement were to evolve this would allow room for the Russians to do the same. If not we are doomed to ""solutions"" by war. There seems to be no shortage of those who belong to the war movement.  To protest the U.S. movement towards war is not an unpatriotic act. It is perhaps the highest act of patriotism. Young people who often join the military in an effort to fulfill a deep sense of idealism should not be subject to the loss of life and limb in order to fulfill the political and ideological ambitions of a cynical ruling elite. To love one's nation is to embrace the potential of its youth not to sacrifice its youth to the gods of material and political ambitions. It is time for the insanity to end.",political,Facebook

Starting tomorrow Midlothian Texas will begin early voting for May 1st special election. This election will include replacing the late Congressman Ron Wright in the US Congress for the Texas 6th District as well as local bond elections city council positions and school board positions. I have briefly researched the 23 congressional candidates and have narrowed down to five that I would consider endorsing. This page is dedicated to creating a centrists political party that primarily wants to eliminate federal deficit spending and eventually pay down our national debt as well as develop compromises to solve our problems by forcing the two predominant parties to work together. For the sake of fairness I have selected two Republicans and two Democrats that I like as well as the one Libertarian. Here are my thoughts on the candidates. Republicans Michael Wood calls himself a conservative Republican and does not seem to be a centrist but there are things I really like about him. He is a Purple Heart veteran and I admire him for that. He states his goal is to repair the Republican Party from the damage Donald Trump has inflicted upon it and restore it to a respected party. This alone shows he has great courage and wants to separate himself from the far right. John Anthony Castro does not call himself a centrists but is a fiscal conservative. He also has innovative ideas for solving some of Americas problems. Democrats Patrick Moses is retired from a 32 year career in Federal Law Enforcement. He has stated his desire to reach across the aisle so this gives him centrist creeds. Jana Lynn Sanchez does not state any centrists ideals but she grew up and lives in the area. Her position on issues are typical Democrat positions but does not seem to carry socialist values. Libertarian Phil Gray has a plan to help pay down the debt through immigration reform similar to some Independence Party plans. I do like Libertarian ideas on reforming drug laws but I do have a problem with a lot of Libertarians wanting to pull back American influence from around the world.  I did not research the city council and school board candidates so I will not comment on those races. I do have an opinion on the bond elections though. Midlothian City services do seem to have outgrown the current City Hall so I endorse the bonds for a new facility that includes a city library. As an avid lap swimmer I also endorse building a rec center with indoor and outdoor pools. I am not sure about contracting the YMCA to operate it though. Are we taxpayers paying to build a YMCA facility? I once used YMCA pools for lap swimming until they forced adult swimmers into a single lane to make room for profitable swim lessons for children. I endorse the bond proposal for new roads also. I cannot endorse the bond proposal for a new police station. This has nothing to do with the defund police movement. In my day job I visit police facilities for a number of city departments in various sized cities. I once worked in the Midlothian police station and remember thinking that it was rather large for a city this size. I know our city is growing and the department may eventually outgrow the current facility but I think it has room for growth inside its current facility with some possible remodeling. One amenity this city does not seem to be investing in is parks. I have been recently working in Flour Mound and was impressed by all of the green space there. There is quite a bit of wooded land in Midlothian I think the city should be trying to acquire for future parks. Many cities in North Texas have beautiful parks and trails and parkland is considered high when ranking a citys quality of life and I would hate to see Midlothian not keep up with our neighbors.,political,Facebook

Sunday 28 March 2021  GOP Lawmakers Seek Greater Control  By Anthony Izaguirre  The Associated Press  Partisan takeovers of election boards. Threats to assess fines against county election officials and to overturn results. Even bans on giving water to voters while they stand in line.  In addition to their nationwide efforts to limit access to the ballot Republican lawmakers in some states are moving to gain greater control over the local mechanics of elections from voter registration all the way to certifying results.  The bills which have become law in Georgia and Iowa resurrect elements of former President Donald Trumps extraordinary campaign to subvert his loss when his backers openly floated the notion of having legislatures override the will of the voters and launched legal challenges against measures that made it easier to vote during the pandemic.  Its an overreach of power said Aunna Dennis executive director of the Georgia chapter of the voting advocacy group Common Cause. Theyre definitely trying to do an upheaval of our election system.  In a step widely interpreted as a way to check Georgias Democratic strongholds Republican Gov. Brian Kemp signed a bill Thursday to give the GOP-dominated Legislature greater influence over a state board that regulates elecwell tions and empowers it to remove local election officials deemed to be underperforming.  Other states are moving in similar directions. In Iowa after left-leaning counties sent voters absentee ballot applications in 2020 a recently signed law would bar election workers from sending the forms out unless requested. It threatens to fine officials for violating rules. A South Carolina proposal would give lawmakers new oversight of the members appointed to the currently independent State Election Commission.  In Arizona a Republican proposal that has since died would have allowed the Legislature to overturn election results and appoint its own Electoral College representatives. The Brennan Center for Justice a public policy group that supports expanded voter access tallied more than 250 restrictive proposals in the states many of them intended to roll back voting methods that were expanded because of the pandemic. That includes early and mail voting options both of which were popular among voters who sought to avoid virus transmission at crowded polling places.  Republicans have said the bills are meant to shore up public confidence in elections although members of the GOP have been the leading voices spreading baseless claims that the 2020 election was fraudulent.  There is universal agreement among experts that the election in which Republicans performed in congressional and state legislative races was free of widespread problems.  Georgias new law is among the most consequential for future elections. The measure will allow the Legislature to select the leader of the state election board and make the elected secretary of state a nonvoting member of the panel essentially sidelining the chief election officer who was picked by voters. The board could then remove local election officials and replace them.  This bill is a tragedy for democracy and it is built on the lie of voter fraud Lauren Groh Wargo chief executive of the group Fair Fight Action which advocates for greater voter participation said on a call with reporters. It means that radical right-wing legislators if they dont like how elections are being run in Quitman or Lowndes or Fulton or Dougherty counties they can wholesale replace those election administrators and put folks from the other side of the state in charge.  The new law also forbids local officials from taking financial grants to help run their elections narrows the window in which voters can request an absentee ballot and requires an ID to vote absentee by mail. It limits where ballot drop boxes can be placed and when they can be accessed. Giving food or water to voters waiting in line to cast ballots is forbidden. Georgia confirmed President Joe Bidens victory with three statewide counts of nearly 5 million ballots and there was no evidence of problems. They are tweaking the laws however they can to make it harder and to put up barriers for voters to stumble on Georgia state Sen. Jen Jordan a Democrat from Atlanta said at an event sponsored by the progressive group The NewDEAL.  The GOP also is cracking down on methods that counties used to increase participation and make voting easier during the pandemic. Republicans in Texas which has some of the most stringent election laws in the country are moving to ban curbside voting a method used in the last election by liberal- leaning Harris County which includes Houston.  Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds a Republican this month signed a GOP bill that closes voting sites at 8 p.m. rather than 9 p.m. shortens the window for early voting by nine days imposes new restrictions on mail and absentee voting and threatens civil fines and criminal charges against local officials who depart from state election law or guidance.  This is a total takeover of elections by the state said Linn County Auditor Joel Miller who was sued by the Trump campaign for mailing absentee ballot applications with some information already filled out to registered voters.tHat  Copyright (c) The Denver Post March 28 2021 edition.,political,Facebook
FROM MOVEMENT TO MOVEMENT: But will there be change?  We are firmly in the transition away from the Trump era to the Biden era or so it seems. The Biden movement is a flashback to a former time: the growth era of a capitalist cycle which if it does not provide everyone's needs at least inspires belief in the possibility of meeting those needs. This is enough for most people. But in the U.S. we are in the dying stages of the capitalist order. Hope has dissipated competition has divided us into the haves and the have-nots.  Both the Biden movement and the Trump movement are reactionary movements: both wish to return us to a former place. The losing movement the Trump movement perhaps provides a glimpse of what lies ahead. It is afterall the child the outgrowth of the former idealized version of the capitalist myth which Joe Biden represents.  Joe Biden likes to speak of possibilities. Possibilities define his view of America. Foundational to this view is that these possibilities are rooted in the capitalist economic order. That somehow possibilities are not achievable in a state sector that somehow talent ambition ingenuity can only thrive when dollar bill's are waived in front of the participants this is the capitalist way.  Yet the same talent ambition and ingenuity exists without the lure of the dollar. Capitalism however has convinced us the fulfillment of these traits is only achievable when abundantly awarded through wealth and income. History however has taught us otherwise. Greatness is achievable through beliefs and incentives other than money. We need to look no further than the teacher the soldier the athlete the artist the nurse the social worker: most of whom are inspired by something other than money. These aspirants are inspired by other ideals and greatness is often achieved among them.  Biden's inaugural address was based on the ideal of cooperation. It was moving it was hopeful it is what many of us socialist have called for for many years: a cooperative world which seeks to meet the needs of all people. And herein lies the problem. While Biden calls for cooperation undoubtedly a sincere expression of his desires the Nation is wedded to an economic order based not on cooperation but on competition. Competition is foundational to the capitalist order; it is structural embedded in the financial framework of the private firm it is glorified it creates winners and losers.  Cooperation and possibilities are noble traits and inspirations but they are undermined by a capitalist ideology which glorifies competition and wealth. Cooperation which Biden seeks conflicts with the capitalist order. It is a great contradiction which we will need to adress otherwise the future will not look much differ than the present.,political,Facebook

Sometimes the jerk chicken does have so much pepper in it that is like jerk pepper with lil chicken. The first time that I eat jerk chicken me tongue get numb-numb with pain. Me eye start watering and I get heart palpitations. I start see dark and me mouth start dribble so hot this jerk chicken was. Like I said is jerk pepper with some chicken in it. Dem Jamaicans is think that they is some a de biggest cooks in de place. Yuh know wuh ah sehing?  Lemme wash me mouth pon dem Trinis lil bit too. Them can cook a passable pouri even though them make a mistake and call it a roti. Somebody needs to tell them that de thing name pouri and not no roti. Yes I said it and Ill say it again it name pouri and nah no roti. They can make a passable pouri. They make a slightly passable roti too even though them mek a mistake with that too and call it a buss-up-shut. It passable I give them that you know you have to give Jack his jacket. One thing about Trinidadians too is that THEY think that they are some of the biggest cooks in de place too. Yuh know wuh ah sehing wid dat too?  The only other Caribbean country that I does hear deh beating dem own cooking drum is Barbados. They have a confused fish that does not know that it is a fish and think that it is a bird. It always jumping out of the water and trying to fly. So as not to hurt its delicate sensibilities dem Bajans does call it a flying fish. Somebody needs to tell dem Bajans that yuh is either a fish or yuhj is a bird. Yuh cyant be both budday. De fish got a set a bones and does deh boring up yuh gums. Heaven forbid yuh swallow a fish bone. Is ning-ning yuh gun see ning-ning. Ah jus mekking laugh de fish does actually taste nice man. Dem does cook it up with cornmeal cou-cou as their national dish. Is dem national dish so I cant bad talk it too much you know how?  Now I is a man dat does bad talk Guyanese fuh one-one thing that them does do tuh yuh know. A good example is talking wrang English. I ent mean Creolese yuh know. Creloese is Guyanese national speak. People is doan know wuh we deh sehing when we start talk Creolese um does twass dem up. What I am talking about is trying to impress people with your command of the English language when you know good and well yuh ent got no dam good command of the English language. People would respect you more if you were to talk to them in your native Creolese rather that to start spouting a set of nonsense with green verbs here incorrect pronunciation there unfortunate sentence construction and misapplied syntax and diction. Another thing that I does bad talk Guyanese men for is the big set a slippers dem does deh wearing. Everywhere yuh look a Guyanese man or boy got on a damn slippers. Big man lil boy it ent mek no difference everybody wearing slippers. Whats up with the slippers budday? Since when slippers became the national footwear of choice for Guyanese men??? When I went home to Guyana the other day I deh feeling shame-shame because I was the only man that ent deh wearing a set a slippers. I felt like a foreigner for wearing a track boots and not the ubiquitous slippers that seem to be standard wear or standard fare for Guyanese men.  Arright leh we talk food now. Guyanese ah proud a we food bad-bad. Hear nah when I used to live in GT I used to wuk for the Guyana Public Communication Agency. Ah think dem does call it GINA now. A part a me wuk was to set up meetings between drainage and irrigation engineers from international aid agencies and their intended beneficiaries. (farmers) When these engineers draw up new drainage and irrigation plans for a particular area I used to go into the community and speak with farmers and invite them to meet with the engineers in the said villages. Was big meeting going on with a set a food that I had to organize with the villagers for the engineers and everybody to eat up and suh after the meeting when there were informal conversations going on. Well hear nah I organized a particular meeting at Ruby on de West Coast food deh dora-dora. Well let me tell allyuh I had the best curry chicken I EVER eat. Yall hear meh? Now Guyanese in general know how fuh cook a good curry chicken. Even if yuh cyant cook nuttin else yuh cud cook curry chicken. I know a man who ent know how fuh boil hot water good yuh know but de man cud cook curry chicken. Rice easy fuh cook right? Well I know people who cyant cook rice widout burning it up but (wait for it wait for it) dem know how fuh cook curry chicken. I know a girl she married bout four year wid husband and bout three children but she does gaff fuh call she mother fuh ask she how fuh boil egg. Meh ent lying yuh know.  Even she self know how fuh cook curry chicken.  Yuh could get a good curry chicken without even trying trying all over the place. Everybody just 4know how to cook a good curry chicken. So when yuh see I seh that I will never forget this particular curry chicken till I dead yuh gaff fuh know how good dis curry chicken was. Yuh just watch this chicken and um falling off de bone. This is the kind a curry chicken that yuh does gaff fuh shy way yuh spoon and eat um with yuh hand um so good. Dem had a man walking round with a big-big bowl wid white rice sharing it out. This rice white-white and loose-loose. De man I did really interested in was de man walking round wid an even bigger bowl dat look like a young 45 gallon drum. This young drum had de chicken curry in um and de man did sharing it out as he walked around. I talking dis story and is dribble I deh hey dribbling still. Yuh know how when a beautiful woman dress up nice-nice wid a coco-cola bottle shape and she sashay into a room and how both man and woman eye does deh following she? (men dribbling and woman vex-vex that somebody look better than them) Heheh. Well is jus suh everybody eye deh following de man wid de curry bowl de man walking round proud-proud wid a big smile pon he face. Me like curry bad man. Ayuh doan even get me started pon seven curry. I proper like pope Indian wedding fuh dat. Hehehe.  Couple Caribbean country got a dish that they call Oil Down I know that Grenada Trinidad and Jamaica all have a version of this dish. Jamaicans does also call provision food (as in Leh ah get a food deh nah? or Weh ah cud get a good food fuh buy?) Everybody in the world know that this dish really name Met-tem-gee every country which do not call it by this name is calling it the wrong name. Yall tell them I she suh. Met-tem-gee bad fuh days (as we used to say as kids) Dash in some fat fluffy duff in dat bad boy and is the next thing to heaven. Some people does add lil salt fish or smoke fish in it too. Of course yuh gaff fuh put in couple whole young ochro too. Dem other countries dont know what they are doing. They should send some cooks to Guyana to learn how to cook it. Dem does try though bless their little hearts.  Man we got nuff nuff dishes that we would cook in Guyana that are outstanding. Chow Mein is another one. Other countries does call it noodles of course you know that they are calling it the wrong name right? Even Chinese come to Guyana and setup cook shop and they learn how to season their chow mein/noodles and fry rice the Guyana way. Guyanese Chinese fry rice taste better than every other fry rice that I have ever eaten. I have eaten fry rice in at least eight countries and none of them taste like a Guyanese Chinee fry rice. Even the Chinese that have probably been cooking fried rice for centuries in China change up their recipe when they came to Guyana. They Guyanize the fry rice baptize it and no other fry rice could match it.  Guyanese have a way of taking other countries dishes and turning around and cooking it better than them. Spaghetti and meatballs is one such food. I hated spaghetti and meatballs when I tasted it in the USA. Now I generally do not like to make pronouncements on anything or any issue after my first engagement with it. I would have to try it at least twice before I make a pronouncement or come to a conclusion. My reasoning is that the person or institution that cooked the dish might have been having an off day the day that I ate their offering. If it tasted the same way after eating it twice then to me that is probably the way that you/they cook it normally. Spaghetti and meatballs was solidly on my Not to do list until I tasted the spaghetti and meatballs that a Guyanese cooked. Budday!!! It tasted like a completely different dish budday to the extent that it should have been baptized and given a different name.  Have you ever eaten a grocery store burger patty in a homemade beef or turkey burger? Um ent got no taste meh boy (or meh girl as the case may be) If you do not Guyanize that burger meat before you grill it and try to make a homemade burger you are going to hate it too. Do I have a witness in here? Hear dis ting nah I went to Toronto Canada for a Caribana carnival celebration. We duck in by an Indian lady house and she did grilling some burgers in she back yard. Ow meh Lawd I had to ask de woman is wuh kinda cow dis burger come from. It could not have come from a regular cow and taste this good. This woman put she fingers she hand she foot or something in this burger meat. Budday I have never before nor have I ever since tasted ANY burger commercial or otherwise that tasted anywhere near this Indian woman burger. This lady Guyanized this burger and spoil burgers forever for me from any/everybody else. Was a Guyanese woman dat! Guyanese can cook bad-bad.  We gun gaff de odda half next time.  --A J Massay,political,Facebook
"America is being destroyed ! No not by the Russians not even by the Chinese or Iranians who would love to see America destroyed. Many foreign enemies would want the decline and destruction of America. This time the barbarians of destruction are from within. The Chinese are investing trillions of dollars all around the globe and almost every country including those in Europe and taking over economically and with immigration while American democrats and lefties are bent on destroying America. China is building new ports new infrastructure and new cities in China and abroad and America is eliminating borders and legal immigration. America is arguing for males to compete in female athletics and gender neutral bathrooms. The whole world is dependent on China for almost all products including medicines that are vital. Never in history have people who have it so good and lived in complete freedom and equality and opportunity tried to destroy the closest country to a utopia. It is the era of America last for the Americans in power. Trump was the last president to put or tried to put America first. The country that is systemically racist has more blacks and brown people and foreign born wanting to come and live in it ! Everybody wants to come here and those who live here and who criticize and hate this country won't leave ! More jews  more muslims more Asians more Latinos and more Europeans want to come here than any other place in the world. Even more Chinese and Russians and Iranians would come here if they could. The socialist democrats here are tearing the country apart from within. They attack the police border control agents small businesses white people the hard working religion traditional families traditions legal immigrants who respect the process and everything of conservative value. Now they attack free speech the right to bear arms and the integrity of voting. What is most perplexing is why ! why are they so anti-American and self hating and hating of others with a different opinion. No one seems to ask which country has been better to be in ? America is being destroyed and with it western culture will be eliminated soon. The ""news"" has become propaganda and misinformation.Big tech social media platforms have also become partisan and centers of censorship of conservatism and traditions ! If we do not stop this by becoming more active and spending time and effort to save our country the last best hope for mankind will be destroyed.Ask those who left their countries of birth and came here. There are millions of such people from Russia and the old USSR Cuba China Venezuela Iran Korea Vietnam Africa The Middle East India Europe and the rest of the world ! Even Australia and Scandinavian countries !! America with all its faults was the greatest country in history but it is truly being broken down.By enemies from within with help from outside now.

Voter suppression is not a democratic endeavor!  Unfortunately GOP controlled states are trying or have passed new laws to that end since the 2020 election.  So the Senate's minority rule feature the fillbuster must be swept from the high chamber to restore simple majority voting to allow passage of this legislation.  The right-wingers will say that they are protecting the vote. NO! What they seek in essence is to restrict voting rights by making voting unnecessarily difficult.  By this design they intend to retain power contrary to democratic principles. DA2020s (Share if you agree!)  //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////  Trumps false narrative about election fraud has prompted lawmakers in 43 states to file bills to limit ballot access.  US voting rights  Landmark US bill to stop voter suppression passes first hurdle in House Voting legislation which also targets gerrymandering and campaign finance needs 60 votes in Senate to become law  Associated Press  Thu 4 Mar 2021 01.18 EST  House Democrats have passed sweeping voting and ethics legislation over unanimous Republican opposition advancing to the Senate what would be the largest overhaul of the US election law in at least a generation.  House Resolution 1 which touches on virtually every aspect of the electoral process was approved 220-210. It would restrict partisan gerrymandering of congressional districts strike down hurdles to voting and bring transparency to a murky campaign finance system that allows wealthy donors to anonymously bankroll political causes.  The bill would be one of the largest expansions of the right to vote in America since the passage of the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act. It requires states to offer early voting as well as same-day automatic and online voter registration. It mandates that states allow anyone to vote by mail if they wish (16 states currently require an excuse) and would impose new limits on how states can remove people from the voter rolls also sometimes referred to as voter purging.  The bill also would limit the manipulation of the physical boundaries electoral districts for partisan gain or gerrymandering a process Republicans used at unprecedented levels a decade ago. States would have to follow fairness criteria when drawing districts require states to set up independent commissions to the lines.  The right to vote is sacred and fundamental  it is the right from which all of our other rights as Americans spring. This landmark legislation is urgently needed to protect that right to safeguard the integrity of our elections and to repair and strengthen our democracy Joe Biden said in a statement on Thursday morning.  The bill is a powerful counterweight to voting rights restrictions advancing in Republican-controlled statehouses across the country in the wake of Donald Trumps repeated false claims of a stolen 2020 election. Yet it faces an uncertain fate in the Democratic-controlled Senate where it has little chance of passing without changes to procedural rules that now allow Republicans to block it.  That rule the filibuster requires 60 votes for legislation to advance. Because Democrats are unlikely to find 10 Republican senators to sign on to the bill there are loud calls to get rid of the rule. But not all Democrats in the senate support ending the filibuster. The fight over whether to keep the rule looms as a major one for the Democrats in the senate; calls to eliminate the filibuster have only grown louder with the sweeping voting restrictions Republicans are passing across the country.  The stakes in the outcome are huge cutting to the foundational idea that one person equals one vote and carrying with it the potential to shape election outcomes for years to come. It also offers a test of how hard President Joe Biden and his party are willing to fight for their priorities as well as those of their voters.  US House passes most ambitious police reform effort in decades This bill will put a stop at the voter suppression that were seeing debated right now said Nikema Williams a new congresswoman who represents the Georgia district that deceased voting rights champion John Lewis held for years. This bill is the Good Trouble he fought for his entire life.  To Republicans however it would give license to unwanted federal interference in states authority to conduct their own elections  ultimately benefiting Democrats through higher turnout most notably among minorities.  Democrats want to use their razor-thin majority not to pass bills to earn voters trust but to ensure they dont lose more seats in the next election House minority leader Kevin McCarthy said from the House floor on Tuesday.  The measure has been a priority for Democrats since they won their House majority in 2018. But it has taken on added urgency in the wake of Trumps false claims which incited the deadly storming of the US Capitol in January.  Courts and even Trumps last attorney general William Barr found his claims about the election to be without merit. But spurred on by those lies state lawmakers across the US have filed more than 200 bills in 43 states that would limit ballot access according to a tally kept by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University.  Trump's fraud claims undermine democracy ex-US election security chief says In Iowa the legislature voted to cut absentee and in-person early voting while preventing local elections officials from setting up additional locations to make early voting easier. In Georgia the House on Monday voted for legislation requiring identification to vote by mail that would also allow counties to cancel early in-person voting on Sundays when many Black voters cast ballots after church.  On Tuesday the supreme court appeared ready to uphold voting restrictions in Arizona which could make it harder to challenge state election laws in the future.  When asked why proponents sought to uphold the Arizona laws which limit who can turn in absentee ballots and enable ballots to be thrown out if they are cast in the wrong precinct a lawyer for the states Republican party said: Because it puts us at a competitive disadvantage relative to Democrats said attorney Michael Carvin.

Is this the least inclusive most racist and exclusive country in the world ? You would think so if you listen to the democrats. Its all doom And gloom. Everything is terrible here. They are always correcting crises that they create or do not exist in the first place. Nancy Pelosi thinks its hard to vote so lets eliminate any requirements to vote. Just let anyone vote with no documents or ID and let them mail in their ballots. Let everyone coming to the border come in too otherwise its inhumane. There is no crisis at the border. Its all a game called catch and release Lets vote trillions of dollars of  relief for the people except it does not go for Covid or the people. Who is going to pay for the insurmountable debt ? The real crises such as keeping schools closed and shutting down businesses and rioting and burning and looting and occupying the Capital is not a crisis. The law has become threatening riots if the court does not rule a certain way. Its called  no justice no peace ! Hundreds of thousands of jobless homeless drug addicts and criminals but we want transgender men to compete in womens sports. If not that is a major crisis ! China is taking over the world and soon going to dominate the globe but we think women are not treated equally here. I wonder which country it is where people are better off? Is it those countries where everyone is trying to leave to come here ? That seems to be the whole world. Gas and oil are a huge crisis like climate change and global warming. Remember only 9 years left for the weather apocalypse! Trump is gone so now they need lots of imaginary crises and problemsto fix. God forbid if they came up with a real new idea or solution for the country. They make up for it with distraction and deflection and noble battles to fight against  windmills and other ghost enemies.,political,Facebook

"Remember awhile back when Trump played up the emergency at the Southern border for political gain? That's what Democrats are doing right now about the ""acute"" threat from domestic terrorism in their efforts to grow the police and surveillance state.  It's not that there is no risk.

Debt Forgiveness is a Christian Value  I am a bankruptcy attorney and see it pretty much every week: Client consider filing for bankruptcy they know it would help them it is the best option but they feel bad about it procrastinate and delay. When considering bankruptcy it is correct there is an obligation to creditors to repay the debt but even more importantly there is also an obligation to yourself and your family.  Family and you must be have a safe financial basis. Whom does it help if one continues to pay creditors live from pay check to pay check and then does not have the money to pay for the car repair or other emergencies that might come up? People often put the interest of creditors above their own.  Sometimes I tell clients about Donald Trump who filed bankruptcy four times. He is rich because he makes good financial decisions. If there is not enough money to pay off the debt within a reasonable time bankruptcy is a valid option and often the only option to get a fresh start.  Making the minimum payment on a $5000 credit card balance will take over 12 years. Most of the payments will go to interest. During that time more credit might be needed the balance possibly goes up instead of down a cycle that is difficult to stop.  It is vital to get people out of the debt circle: Getting more pay day loans to pay other loans off. Getting a second mortgage to pay off credit cards. Taking out money from retirement and so on. It is not only important to the individual to her health and well being but also important to the society.  If too many people are in debt and depend on the mercy of creditors it is not good for the society. A healthy society lives form a stable middle class. This has always been like this even 2000 years ago to Roman times.  It was so important to the society that it was written in the Bible. In Deuteronomy 15 it says: At the end of every seven years you must cancel debts. 2 This is how it is to be done: Every creditor shall cancel any loan they have made...  It has always been important to the society that people get a break and deserve a fresh start. This is a Christian value. The Lord wants people to be free debt free at least every 7 years. There is no reason to feel bad or being ashamed about filing for bankruptcy. It's is not an option it is a right.  If you are thinking about filing and have been wondering how it works we offer a free no obligation consultation in which the attorney answers all questions and explains the process.

When Race Identity Trumps Your Hungry Belly  By Helena R Edwards  What does poor Whites in West Virginia and poor Blacks in Alabama have in common? Poverty. They both want to be able to put a roof over the heads of their families clothes on their backs food in their bellies and for their children to get an education so that they would grow up and become adults who have life a little easier than how they currently have it. The Wild and Wonderful Whites of West Virginia is a documentary that is featured on Amazon Prime. I recommend viewing of it for those who seek understanding. These folks seem to be descendants of Scott Irish and they racially identify as whites but their lives are far from privileged. They have more in common with Lalees Kin - another documentary on YouTube about a family who identifies as Black in Alabama. This documentary highlights the legacy of cotton on the family.  When a poor white family who is trying to survive on public assistance somewhere in Appalachia or upstate New York hears other people talk about White Privilege they become irate. For them life is a living hell. They hardly can make ends meet. Their children are on opiates attempting to medicate the hardships of their experiences and yet some people have the audacity to say that they have white privilege. What makes it more infuriating for them is when they turn on their only television set and see a parade of Black faces on CNN who are doing far better than them. So in their world Affirmative Action is putting Blacks ahead of them while they are stuck in the Appalachian dirt poor white and unprivileged.  This is the poor Appalachian white individuals reality. How can you convince him that he or she is wrong? You certainly cant win the argument that the Black faces paraded on CNN arent doing better than he or she is and you certainly cannot argue that whiteness has given him or her an advantage in his or her current state. So as a result of his or her reality and the narrative that is pushed he or she becomes angry at the Blacks whom he or she deems are given an unfair advantage.  This poor White Appalachian angry mans or womans eyes are not focused at the top - on the rulers of the country. He or she isnt measuring the booty of the one percent. He or she is only focusing on the scarce resources that is distributed between the 99 percent that are also experiencing pressure from the rulers on top. Its like two employees who apply for a position at work. One employee was given the job. The employee who didnt get the job is angry with the employee who got the job rather than the bosses who gave the job to the other employee. The employee who didnt get the job cant afford to be angry with the bosses because he risks losing the current job he has so he takes his anger out on his competition. This is a dynamic in distribution of scarce resources.  Robert Kennedy Jr. seemed to have understood the dynamics of scarce resources and those of poverty. He was working to unite poor people in Appalachia with poor people from the cotton fields in Alabama but he was deemed a threat by those who dont want to increase the amount of resources to be distributed to the 99 percent. Donald Trump also seems to understand these dynamics and he too was working to increase the resources of the poor Appalachian and the poor Alabaman but race became his Achilles Heel. The people who want to keep the poor people divided since 1676 when the Bacon Rebellion highlighted the threat to them when slaves and indentured servants come together used race once more as they did in 1676 to permanently bridge the gap between the haves and the have nots.  Donald Trump is a better human being than Bill Clinton Barack Obama George W. Bush Joe Biden and the lot of these Presidents put together. His administration treated the opiate afflicted as humans in funding treatment for their rehabilitation. Bill Clinton George W. Bush and the Black Messiah Barack Obama failed in doing the same for those afflicted with the crack cocaine epidemic. On the contrary Joe Biden Bill Clinton and Kamala Harris all sent these crack afflicted individuals to jail and Biden and Clinton rendered them homeless as they were barred from public housing.  Barack Obama pretended to consume water from Flint Michigan that was lead infected as a way of convincing the Black people in Flint that this poisonous water was safe for them to drink. Donald Trump might not be cultured or might not be blessed with Miss Manners social graces but he regarded the poor and the drug afflicted as humans rather than trash. But the poor Black people couldnt see that Donald Trump was working to lift them out of poverty. They became blinded by the rhetoric from race theory. Unfortunately race theory in America has become so ingrained that some poor people will choose starvation rather than give up their racial identities.,political,Facebook

PRISON FOOD for the MIND  2020 THE Directors Cut  It would only be fitting that ''THE YEAR 2020'' be the opening synopsis of discussion it goes without saying that 2020 in one form or another has left a undeniable imprint on humanity. Mind body heart and spirit has been touched and scarred and in many case's wounds mentally emotionally and physically will never heal. 2020 was a year unlike any mankind has ever witnessed even as I state the obvious the strange thing is it still feels like a understatement. What made 2020 so unforgettable goes without saying but I'll say it anyway the Big Bad and Ugly Corona Virus better know as Covid19. Covid did the unthinkable your race religion and economic status was of no consequence to this juggernaut of a virus saint's and sinners world wide on seven continent's were not immune to the possibility of ones own mortality. For the first time in my life I witnessed a situation that Everyone the emphasis is on Everyone has had to adjust to this new world order. Rich poor good bad beautiful ugly tall short incarcerated not incarcerated educated uneducated liberal conservative Democrat Republican independent blackbrownyellowredwhite and old and young alike and everyone in between are in the cross hair's of a common enemy.  This destroyer of men women and children has extinguished thousands of life's in epic proportions never before seen in modern day history. This notorious ''villain'' Covid19 has bullied the entire world into a matrix of uncertainty. Never before in mankind's illustrious history dating back to the start of civilization has every country's government and all it citizens world wide in all seven continent's shared a level playing field regarding a singular or numerous circumstance be it wealth power oil democracy or healthcare. The list goes on and on nonstop etcetera etceteraetcetera illustrating massive inequities of resources between the wealthiest countries and the poorest countries. Covid19 ''knocked out'' all that history and accomplished what ''fairness'' never succeeded in. What might that be you may ponder........ What might that be you may ask? The answer is simple their were no ''favorites'' or ''underdogs'' when dealing with this plague every country started at ground zero. Meaning superpower countries third world countries and all countries stretched across seven continent's were in the same starting position with equal opportunity to live or die.The best analogy to follow this train of thought is to imagine that every country in the entire world has a automobile that will be entered into a worldwide race envision NASCAR style racing at the Daytona 500 with a caveat of provisions to make interesting.  In a vast majority of the populations worldly mind based off logic and perception one would assume the richest country on earth would win this '''race''. One might expect the United States to enter the race with the fastest technically advanced racing machine the world has ever witnessed. In betting circles the U.S would be a 2 to 1 favorite to win the race. And on the other hand many people would assume a poor county like Wuhan would stand little to no chance of winning this race and would be a long shot and 40 to 1 underdog. The thing about overwhelming favorites is they rarely live up to the hype and the thing about underdog's is they are usually underestimated which motivates them to ascend to greater heights and become victorious. Covid19 is real it's not a game it's not a sport in any literal stretch of the imagination. Metaphorically speaking I used NASCAR as a analogy because in many way's when the citizens of the world were notified that a alien infection known as Cornoavirus entered the atmosphere and was extremely contagious the nations of the world started a ''race'' with life or death implications. As I aforementioned in the chapter every nation in the world and it's citizens started in the same starting position and wealth and power would not cloak countries and it's citizens in immunity against death and destruction anymore then it would poverty stricken and powerless countries.  As of January the first 2021 a new year is upon us. And a entire year has passed since the race against Covid-19 and it's deadly aftermath. The United States of America the richest and most powerful country in the world has seen more deaths of it citizens then any country in the world. More then 350000 plus people in the U.S.A. have become victims of this virus and lost their life's. How did we get to this point ? How has the richest and most powerful country allowed this to happen ? How has United States of America become the pandemic epicenter of the world ? When did America become some American's worst Nightmare realized ? To answer these questions first we must dissect our brains from the very beginning. Close your eye's and let your mind drift back to any given day in January 2020. Can you remember the first time you wore a mask and tried to apply 6 feet social distance to your daily life ? How did you feel about having to wear a mask and having to practice social distancing in public places ? I know many Americans were skeptical and believed that mask and social distancing was a over reaction by state and government official's due to the pandemic that was occurring in China at the time. Many Americans decided to disregard mask and social distancing guidelines and ordinances altogether. Are you one of those American people ? Be honest we're you one of millions of people that deified science and logic and continued a reckless and blatant disregard of human life ?  For some the self reflection questionnaire may come across in a harsh judgemental and accusatory tone but this not my intention. My intention is not to point finger's and lay blame. My intention is not to transport those who answered yes to the question's down a road trip of guilt trip. My questions are valid and important exercise if we are to understand how America became the Biggest ''Loser''. I'm sure my terminology of the word loser attached to America will entice my fair share of detractors who will argue toothed and nail that America is ''winning'' this war against Covid; The population of people in America who fall in this category of thinking share at least one common thread of unity ninety nine percent of these people are Donald Trump supporters and loyalists. In this moment you may be asking yourself where is he going with this and why is it is relevant to know if someone is a Trump supporter in regards to Covid-19. If we are to fully grasps and understand how the richest and most powerful country in the world has 350000 plus casualties we must devour and digest all the ingredients and factor's of humanity that has the nation on brink of no return !  One plus One equals Two Two plus Two equals Four Donald Trump plus Donald Trump equals Division. These mathematics are examples of universal truth. None will dispute my first two examples of truth but about 74000000 people give or take will dispute vehemently how I derived at my third example of truth. To these Trumpeter's I would say numbers don't lie. To these Trumpeter's I would say your mind and conscious are deaf and blind if you can not and will not acknowledge truth. I'm sure Trumpeter's at this very moment are shaking their head's still not convinced. For the sake of argument I will very graciously patiently and meticulously ''show my work'' like a high school math test.....Donald Trump is a demigod to his supporter's and voter's. Donald Trump is divisive and decisive in his agenda to divide the nation into Three section's White America Black America and Hispanic America. Donald Trump succeeded in dividing the country socially with blatant racial rhetoric inspired speeches tweets and propaganda. Donald Trump's toolbox of tool's helped him accomplish division in this country are the same exact tool's that founded this ''Great'' country 500 years ago. Racism Hate Lie's Fear and minimizing the life and liberty of people of color. ''Make America Great Again'' a slogan designed to promote hate and Racism. Donald Trump plus Donald Trump equals division.  Wow is what I'm thinking at this very moment......... Life imitates art is a expression I've heard before in passing but never thought twice about but now I understand the sentiment. Dear Reader's let me explain these surreal emotions I am experiencing.The previous page I wrote about how Donald Trump plus Donald Trump equals division from there I unleashed a logical spiel about why I believed this to be a unquestioned truth. Coincidentally I began writing the previous page at literally 6:13 a.m. on January 6 2021 the same day the Senate in Washington D.C. convened to vote yay or nay to certificate the electoral college vote regarding the presidential election. Who knew that January 6 2021 would be a historical infamous shameful and none to surprising day in the illustrious ''Great'' American history. For four years Donald Trump has used every trick up his sleeve to corrupt the hearts minds and the will of the American people. It is said that every action has a reaction; It is said that what you put in a relationship is what you get out a relationship; Hate racism stereotypes and intolerance is what he ''fed'' the American people and seems as if sixty percent of white American gobbled up the propaganda with a ravenous appetite and craved and begged unapologetically for seconds................and as it stands currently their hunger is insatiable and will never be satisfied............Donald Trump action's fractured the Spirit of America and divided the Soul's.  by American X,political,Facebook

I want you to imagine this situation. With what happened in capitol the other day and with the kind of issues now in the media on the Trump administration the many laws being broken everyday and then the notion that Christians and Christian leaders and prophets are standing behind him cheering him on. What if these acts begin to prove to the government and the rest of the world that Christianity is the cause of such anarchy? What if? Just what if.  If this happens could it lead them to begin to find a way to ban Christianity because of the intolerance they see us exhibiting and the discrimination meted out to non-believers?  If this happens would we be the ones arming them with what they need to begin to shut Christianity down as stated in the Bible? Maybe the Antichrist would then arise in order to unite the people because of what the world thinks we are doingthat we arent peaceful and loving people.  So instead of being part of the problem I stand with Christ who said Love each other and in so doing prove that you are my disciples. He also said Love your enemies. 1 Peter 2:12 says Be careful to live properly among your unbelieving neighbors. Here he didnt say to overthrow your unbelieving neighbors. He said live properly among them.  In 1 Peter 3:15-16 he explained this by saying Instead you must worship Christ as Lord of your life. And if someone asks about your hope as a believer always be ready to explain it. But do this in a gentle and respectful way. Keep your conscience clear. Then if people speak against you they will be ashamed when they see what a good life you live because you belong to Christ.  That verse says we should explain our hope in a gentle and respectful manner. We are supposed to live by example of love gentleness peace and holiness. But instead most Christians live worse than non-believers and yet we think its the law that would help them to accept Christianity when we ourselves cant even keep it? I personally dont think putting in a president or government that will enforce laws against abortion and gay is the answer. In fact Im starting to think that all the antiChrist has to do is just say Im pro-life and anti gay and he would have the vote of the Christian leaders who would disregard everything else. Remember Jesus said that if possible they will be deceived. So we need to be a little bit more spiritual.  My dear friends 2020 was a year of pruning. I pray we have been pruned. I also pray we will not aid in making Christianity the mockery of the crowd. Let us first take out the log in our own eyes.,political,Facebook
"BEFORE EMBRACING AMERICA-FIRST AGENDA DAVID PERDUE WAS AN OUTSOURCING EXPERT  (Share if you believe that Georgians should know the sad truth about their Senator DA2020)  Mr. Perdue who faces one of two runoff elections in Georgia that will determine control of the Senate built a business record that shifted manufacturing and jobs overseas.  By Stephanie Saul Richard Fausset and Michael LaForgia  Jan. 1 2021 Updated 1:24 p.m. ET  The biographical video from Senator David Perdues first campaign in 2014 celebrated a narrative arc that many fellow Georgians either related to or have aspired to: the story of a humble boy from rural America whose hard work catapulted him into a global business career navigating free markets and faraway lands all the while gathering stores of wisdom and wealth.  The embrace of global commerce has been a hallmark of modern Georgia showcased in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics dissected by the novelist Tom Wolfe and promoted by among others Mr. Perdues Nafta-loving cousin Sonny Perdue governor from 2003 to 2011. Three years later in his maiden run for office David Perdue would boast of his international experience as a consultant and chief executive while speaking to a gathering of Republicans in Bibb County close to his middle Georgia hometown.  Theres only one candidate in this race thats ever lived outside the United States Mr. Perdue said. How can you bring value to a debate about the economy unless you have any understanding about the free-enterprise system and what it takes to compete in the global economy?  Now facing one of a pair of Jan. 5 runoff elections in Georgia that will determine control of the Senate Mr. Perdue has continued to make his global business experience the essence of his brand. But that has highlighted the contradictions that emerge  in his career and in his character but also in his party and his region  as he embraces the populist America-first strains of Trumpism.  The man who has lately voiced support for some of President Trumps signature tariffs built his career as an unapologetic free-trading practitioner of the outsourcing arts. As a top executive at companies including Reebok Sara Lee and Dollar General he was often deeply involved in the shift of manufacturing and jobs to low-wage factories in China and other Asian countries.  A review of that business record shows a man who achieved significant successes making millions managing complex periods of corporate growth and change and creating domestic jobs particularly at Dollar General. But there were also disappointments like the failed trucking business he ran with Sonny Perdue and his fruitless effort to rescue a company called Pillowtex that brought heartbreak to a North Carolina mill town. And while the senator often speaks of having led the Reebok turnaround as president of the companys flagship brand in the early 2000s he moved on from the company after a rival who today questions Mr. Perdues contribution to the turnaround was installed above him.  The man who spent much of his life broadening his horizons took to the stage at a Trump rally in Macon before Election Day and mocked Senator Kamala Harriss first name mispronouncing it with an exaggerated stumble that to critics amounted to crude racism. His campaign has called it an innocent mispronunciation.  The man who dons a faded denim jacket to reinforce his connection to everyday Georgians has a record of aloofness with an aversion to holding town hall meetings and a thin skin for tough questions. Now he has chosen a further withdrawal declining to participate in additional debates after one in which his Democratic opponent Jon Ossoff called him a crook for his prolific stock-trading while in the Senate.  Mr. Perdue did not respond to requests to be interviewed for this article. In response to written questions his campaign issued a statement that said in part Throughout his four decades working in the real world before being elected to the Senate David Perdue led American companies that saved and created tens of thousands of American jobs.  As when he first ran for office six years ago Mr. Perdue who is 71 regularly invokes those decades in business to style himself the ultimate Washington outsider though it was his cousin the former governor who gave him his entree to politics and helped nurture his ascent.  Taking aim at his 33-year-old opponent who runs a London-based documentary film company and has never held public office Mr. Perdues campaign has fixed on a $1000 payment from a Hong Kong media company to charge that Mr. Ossoff had a two-year working relationship with the Chinese Communist Party.  In its statement to The New York Times most of which dwelled on Mr. Ossoff the Perdue campaign called it ridiculous to compare the senators leadership in American companies with Jon Ossoffs foreign-owned company with shady ties to the Chinese government. (Mr. Ossoffs spokeswoman dismissed that claim as one of the most laughable smear campaigns in Georgia history.)  Mr. Perdues campaigns biographical video meanwhile has been refreshed for 2020. Edited out is a section that showed the senator posing with his wife on Chinas Great Wall.  From a Watermelon Patch to the World Mr. Perdue grew up in Warner Robins a small city about 100 miles south of Atlanta home to Robins Air Force Base. Airmen coming and going from foreign deployments connected the city to the wider world.  But life could still move to rural rhythms. Mr. Perdue traces his roots back to nearby Bonaire a farming community where Perdues settled in the early 1800s. Mr. Perdue recalls picking watermelons on a family-owned farm alongside Sonny who would become Mr. Trumps agriculture secretary in 2017.  While farming was a family pursuit Mr. Perdues parents followed a different path  education. David Perdue Sr. eventually became county schools superintendent.  Mr. Perdue would later go on to extol his fathers leadership in desegregating the countys schools but the historical record provides a different picture revealing the school system employed delay tactics until the N.A.A.C.P. sued and a court ordered it to comply.  The future senator graduated from high school in 1968 two years before the schools were fully integrated. Standout student varsity athlete and class president he was awarded a coveted appointment to the Air Force Academy.  David has those personal traits that cause him to be recognized as a person of worth his high school principal Milton Sutherlin wrote in a recommendation letter. His character is that always of a gentleman and he holds high those Christian ideals that speak well of his home training his school and his community.  But while the Air Force would prove a good fit for his cousin Sonny who served three years and was promoted to the rank of captain it was not so for David. He received Bs and Cs in a brief stint at the academy and by early 1969 let it be known that he wanted out.  I have realized that I have made a mistake and I do not want this type of career he wrote in January 1969 to Jack Brinkley the congressman who had sponsored him. His plan was to attend the Georgia Institute of Technology and try to play basketball.  His basketball career never materialized but Mr. Perdue would earn undergraduate and masters degrees at Georgia Tech. And over the next three decades he would position himself on the winning side of a seismic economic shift sweeping the South.  A Global Man of the New South Increasingly and inexorably the regions apparel and textile industry was turning to foreign contractors to manufacture its products. The disruption which meant thousands of layoffs for low-skilled workers in Southern mill towns was Mr. Perdues ticket to the world. He became an expert in outsourcing.  I spent most of my career doing that he would later say in a deposition.  His apprenticeship in outsourcing began while he was still in school. In 1972 he joined Kurt Salmon Associates a consulting company that had earned its reputation sending bright young engineers into Southern clothing factories to solve technical problems and boost efficiency. The company had a large Atlanta office and by the 1970s was aspiring to a more-global footprint.  The city was too. Born as a regional railroad hub Atlanta had begun adding international flights to its growing airport creating yet more opportunities for a metropolis that had already rocketed past its Southern rivals fueled by relentless civic boosterism and a reputation for racial moderation.  William Sand an engineer who worked in the Atlanta office with Mr. Perdue recalled that in the 1970s as Southern factories were beginning to close new ones were opening in Mexico and Asia. Kurt Salmon he said became experts at helping companies source product from overseas.  Mr. Perdue left in 1984 and worked at a few other places before ending up at Sara Lee which was best known for its baked goods but was also an apparel manufacturer. He was hired in 1992 to open a headquarters in Hong Kong where he lived for two years establishing operations throughout Asia from the ground up he would later say.  The ripple effects reached home. In 1994 the company eliminated thousands of jobs including 230 at its Spring City Knitting plant in Cartersville Ga. Most of the workers were women who earned $4.25 an hour sewing garments.  By that time Mr. Perdue was globe-trotting with yet another company Haggar Clothing which had chosen him to lead its international operation with one aim  increasing foreign sourcing. Within three years he had done just that boosting international production from 60 percent to 75 percent. As company plants were closed in the United States workers in Mexico performed the job for $1.50 an hour.  By 1998 Mr. Perdue was headed to Reebok which ultimately promoted him to lead its main division as it forged licensing deals with the National Football League and the National Basketball Association. Major league teams with their star power and marquee players burnished Reeboks cachet leading to its acquisition by Adidas in 2005. The manufacturing of most of the companys products was outsourced primarily to China and elsewhere in Asia.  The 2014 video produced by Mr. Perdues Senate campaign  in which he discusses licensing agreements  portrays him as the architect of Reeboks turnaround. Even in the wake of improvements in the companys business though Reeboks chairman Paul Fireman passed over Mr. Perdue for promotion to the companys No. 2 job.  In December 2001 the company announced that Mr. Perdue who as head of the Reebok brand had reported directly to Mr. Fireman would instead report to Jay Margolis who had formerly headed other brands for the company but was suddenly named chief operating officer.  Paul Fireman decided he wanted one guy to run it all from a C.O.O. point of view said Kenneth Watchmaker Reeboks chief financial officer until 2006. Thats where the two of them competed and Jay got the nod and David left after a period of time.  Mr. Margolis says that he and Mr. Fireman actually pushed out Mr. Perdue who has characterized his departure from Reebok as voluntary. I look back on David. He couldnt make decisions. He was so indecisive he couldnt move the product forward Mr. Margolis said.  As for the licensing deals Mr. Margolis said those were the brainchild of Mr. Fireman.  Mr. Fireman reached by phone said I dont remember firing him. He added: Im not challenging Jays recollection; I just dont remember myself.  Mr. Fireman did not address a question about the extent to which Mr. Perdue was involved in turning around the brands. A long time has passed since then he said. David was a good solid employee for the four or five years he was with me at a high level Mr. Fireman said. And I knew him as a good person.  Within months of Mr. Margoliss promotion Mr. Perdue was in discussions with a headhunter seeking an executive with the know-how and experience to turn around Pillowtex a troubled sheet and towel manufacturer with well-known brands in its portfolio including Cannon Fieldcrest and Royal Velvet.  Leaving behind what he would later describe as $5 million worth of in-the-money unvested Reebok stock options Mr. Perdue agreed in spring 2002 to take the job as chief executive of Pillowtex.  The company was just emerging from bankruptcy and thousands of workers at its home base in Kannapolis N.C. viewed Mr. Perdue as a potential savior according to Scott Shimizu a former executive vice president. Looking back though Mr. Shimizu said he believed Mr. Perdues inaction led to the companys demise.  The company needed to sell off assets quickly and outsource production to survive  with the possibility of retaining part of its United States work force  but Mr. Shimizu says Mr. Perdue took few steps to do either.  He didnt really help us said Mr. Shimizu. We were waiting for him to bring the Ten Commandments to us. They never came.  Mr. Perdue would later say he had been misled about the depth of the companys financial problems including a badly underfunded pension plan. He became embroiled in a dispute with Pillowtex over its failure to live up to the compensation agreement he had negotiated.  The company imploded and about 7650 people lost their jobs most of them in North Carolina. The Charlotte Observer called it the largest mass layoff in state history. The hard feelings toward Mr. Perdue were rife in Kannapolis and in 2014 his Democratic Senate opponent Michelle Nunn would release an ad set there highlighting the bitterness.  Mr. Perdue who had been at Pillowtex less than a year soon found a new opportunity that would also touch large numbers of working-class people: at Dollar General. The company boasts that 25 percent of its products retail for less than $1.  As chief executive Mr. Perdue oversaw the opening of a Hong Kong office in 2004 increasing the global sourcing that helps to provide the low everyday price our customers count on according to a company announcement. Among the global sources were manufacturers in China records show.  Low wages were another way the company controlled costs. Store managers sued the company complaining that they were not paid overtime even though they took on nonmanagerial duties unloading trucks and stocking shelves after hours. Some of their claims as well as legal complaints from female workers who said they were inequitably compensated resulted in payouts.  Dollar General flourished under Mr. Perdues leadership adding more than 2000 stores and expanding the use of coolers to stock more grocery items. Former colleagues who visited Mr. Perdue at the companys Tennessee headquarters said it was apparent he was preparing Dollar General for acquisition. In 2007 Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company announced it would purchase Dollar General for about $7 billion. It was later reported that Mr. Perdue walked away with a $42 million payout.  The Perdue family had lived in Nashvilles tony Belle Meade section but it was time to head back to Georgia where Mr. Perdue would ultimately settle on Sea Island a wealthy sanctuary on the southern coast.  The Outsider In 2010 as Sonny Perdue was finishing his second term as governor he named his cousin David to the board of the Georgia Ports Authority.  About a year later records show the cousins formed a company called Perdue Partners which in December 2012 acquired Benton Express an Atlanta-based trucking company that had operated as a regional family business for nearly 80 years. They renamed it Benton Global and pledged to reinvigorate the business by drawing on overseas connections and especially David Perdues ties to Asia according to press reports and interviews with former employees.  The Perdues installed two loyalists of the former governor in top management positions and oversaw the purchase of new tractor-trailers. But the promised new international business never materialized and the company already suffering from flagging revenues struggled to pay its bills. It closed abruptly in 2015 leaving more than 500 truck drivers clerks and terminal workers unemployed.  As a member of the ports authority board Mr. Perdue voted repeatedly on infrastructure improvements that might have benefited his trucking business The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. A spokesman for Mr. Perdue said at the time that none of the votes posed a conflict of interest or aided Mr. Perdue financially.  In 2013 Georgias senior senator Saxby Chambliss announced that he would not stand for re-election the next year. In David Perdues telling he drove to see his cousin and tried to convince him to run. Well he told me he didnt feel led to do so but then he said I should consider running Mr. Perdue later recalled in an interview.  When Mr. Perdue decided to run he recruited top aides from his cousins campaign staff. Davids team was Sonnys team said Jack Kingston a longtime Republican congressman who also sought the vacant seat. Sonny Perdue he said was very instrumental in his cousins campaign.  For all that David Perdue branded himself the outsider the man with the real-world business savvy needed to effect change. The Republican primary was crowded with well-known and seasoned politicians and Mr. Perdue attacked them for their seasoning portraying them in ads as ineffectual mewling babies.  ""We were hoping that we could find an Achilles heel  hes lazy hes going to say something stupid Mr. Kingston said of the campaign. We found him to be pretty disciplined and hard-working. I have to give him good marks.  After defeating Mr. Kingston in a primary runoff Mr. Perdue went on to face Ms. Nunn an executive at a nonprofit whose father Sam Nunn was a former Democratic senator from Georgia. Though both candidates benefited from famous family names Ms. Nunn thought she might gain the upper hand by focusing on the negative effects of Mr. Perdues embrace of globalism.  A month before the election a transcript surfaced of a nine-year-old deposition in which Mr. Perdue said he had spent most of my career outsourcing. Questioned by reporters Mr. Perdue replied that he was proud of that record. This is a part of American business part of any business he said adding People do that all day.  Ms. Nunn pressed the point in her ads and on the debate stage. But she was the underdog and 2014 proved to be a bad year for Democrats burdened by a lack of enthusiasm for President Barack Obama and his signature legislation the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Perdue blasted Mr. Obamas handling of the Ebola virus crisis and vowed to repeal Obamacare. He practically waltzed to victory.  The outsider arrived on Capitol Hill pushing a term-limit plan and railing against career politicians to the annoyance of his fellow Georgia Republican Senator Johnny Isakson according to two people familiar with the views of Mr. Isakson who had spent many years in politics and was gearing up for a third Senate run.  The record Mr. Perdue built was reliably conservative. He submitted a far-fetched  and critics said regressive  proposal to replace income taxes with sales taxes on goods and services. He proposed limits on the ability of immigrants to sponsor family members instead giving priority to college-educated young people with high-paying jobs.  In the beginning he also spoke and voted as one would expect a free trader to do. In 2015 he voted to give Mr. Obama enhanced powers to negotiate big trade agreements including the Trans-Pacific Partnership the most substantial trade accord since the North American Free Trade Agreement of the 1990s.  But Mr. Perdue was also early to see the potential in Mr. Trump who offered a kind of mirror reflection of Mr. Perdues own political persona as chief executive change agent. The two men reportedly met at Trump Tower during Mr. Perdues 2014 run. And after Mr. Trumps inauguration the senator could be unrestrained in his praise at one point comparing the new president to Winston Churchill. This guy I think is a historic person of destiny at a time and place in America when weve got to make a right-hand turn here Mr. Perdue said.  Mr. Perdue and his fellow Republicans quickly had to grapple with the presidents determination to break the partys mold on global trade. Three days into his tenure Mr. Trump tore up the Trans-Pacific Partnership calling it a rape of our country.  Although Mr. Perdues campaign has said that he consistently supported the presidents America-first trade policies the senator spoke out in 2017 against a Trump-backed plan to impose a border adjustment tax that would have raised taxes on companies that import goods into the United States. A year later he criticized the presidents plan to impose steep tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum calling for a more targeted strategy.  But by late 2019 as Mr. Perdues re-election bid on a ticket with Mr. Trump loomed he seemed more amenable to the presidents approach.  The tariffs are creating the opportunity for people to come to the table he said according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. For the first time in five decades we are standing up to the Chinese and other trading partners around the world and all we want is equal access and a level playing field.  The crosscurrents on trade could be tricky and suddenly Mr. Perdues globalist background made him susceptible to attacks from fellow conservatives. In September 2019 Lou Dobbs the powerful pro-Trump TV personality reported that Mr. Perdue and another senator were visiting Beijing where Mr. Dobbs warned they may well be undercutting U.S. and China trade negotiations and progress made by the president. Mr. Dobbs noted Mr. Perdues outsourcing record.  A day later Mr. Dobbs issued a correction noting that Mr. Trump had approved the trip.  The China Problem In 2016 Mr. Perdue had preached Republican unity as the divisive Mr. Trump began gaining ground in the G.O.P. primary. But the senator helped spark a civil war among Georgia Republicans in 2020 when he and his Georgia runoff-mate Senator Kelly Loeffler demanded the resignation of the states top elections official a Republican calling the election he oversaw an embarrassment.  More recently the senators supported a failed Texas lawsuit that would have blocked the election result in Georgia where President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. beat Mr. Trump by about 12000 votes and in three other states Mr. Trump lost.  The battle over Mr. Perdues Senate seat has been no less fierce. Mr. Ossoffs crook attack in a televised debate in October was based on disclosures that Mr. Perdue the Senates most prolific stock trader made a number of well-timed trades including in companies that could be affected by his committees votes. An investigation of some of Mr. Perdues stock dealings by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission ended without prosecution and Mr. Perdue has used those facts to argue that he has done nothing wrong.  Mr. Ossoff has revived criticism of Mr. Perdues outsourcing record. And the senator has also had to fend off charges of bigotry for both his mockery of Ms. Harriss name and an online campaign ad that showed a photo of Mr. Ossoff who is Jewish with a lengthened nose. Mr. Perdues campaign has called the image in the ad an accident caused by a filter applied by an outside vendor handling the graphic design.  For his part Mr. Perdues closing attack is in keeping with Republicans emerging argument that Democrats like Mr. Ossoff are too weak and in some cases too compromised to stand up to the threat of Chinese global dominance.  Mr. Ossoff Mr. Perdue contends is a radical left-winger with a grave China problem. He cites as proof a $1000 agreement that allowed a large media company in Hong Kong PCCW to rebroadcast a documentary Mr. Ossoffs company produced about the Islamic State.  Previous reports have characterized one of PCCWs investors China Unicom as a state-owned Chinese company a point Mr. Perdue has used in an effort to tie Mr. Ossoff to the Chinese Communist Party.  For two years he worked with the C.C.P. the senator said in a Fox News interview.  Mr. Perdue has said little about his own China ties.  In 1991 the year before he headed to Hong Kong to build Sara Lees Asian outsourcing operation from the ground up the company proudly announced a new foothold in Asia  a deal in Fuzhou China.  The joint venture Fujian Sara Lee Consumer Products manufactured toothpaste shampoo and other personal care products. It was partially owned by the Chinese government according to a report in The Chicago Tribune announcing the venture.  As the Fujian arrangement continued Mr. Perdue busied himself with building Sara Lees first centralized sourcing operation in Asia including in mainland China he said in a deposition in 2005. That involved lining up suppliers and overseeing quality control and human rights practices for the company which manufactured Hanes clothing among other things.  No American firm could have established such an operation in China at that time without dealing extensively with the government or the Communist Party industry experts said.  You dont just wander into China without central government and local party officials wanting to know what youre doing said Michael Posner a professor at New York Universitys Stern School of Business and a top human rights official during the Obama administration. Its a very controlled environment. And anybody there who is dealing with factories would have had to deal with that. (While some of its products remain on the market Sara Lee has since disbanded.)  This week The Times asked Mr. Perdues campaign if he had any other business involving the Chinese government.  The campaign declined to answer.  Kate Kelly and Jannat Batra contributed reporting. Susan Beachy Kitty Bennett and Sheelagh McNeill contributed research.  More on the Georgia Senate Races Democrats Georgia Hopes Rest on Jon Ossoff 33.

STOP ROMANTICIZING DIVIDED GOVERNMENT IF MCCONNELL IS MAJORITY LEADER THERE WILL BE NO PROGESS.  (Share if you agree DA2020!)  Opinion by Catherine Rampell Columnist  November 9 2020 at 6:27 p.m. EST This column has been updated.  With Joe Biden now president-elect and partisan control of the Senate hanging in the balance pundits are already romanticizing divided government  a Democratic president alongside a Republican-controlled legislative chamber.  It sounds inherently moderate wax some commentators; its a good moment because in order to get something done people are going to have to cooperate and compromise claim others. In this telling divided government is paradoxically just what the country needs to heal our divisions.  Its a nice thought.  Unfortunately a single man stands in the way of this fantasy. And its not the guy in the White House. Its the current Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.)  to whom Senate custom gives nearly unilateral power to block most initiatives from ever getting a vote compromises or efforts toward common ground be damned. Over and over McConnell has already exercised this power.  Its true that today as when President Trump was elected four years ago Democrats and Republicans already agree on oodles of issues. Or at least the exhausted middle majority of Americans and the middle chunk legislators do. Or most Democrats plus some peeled-off Republicans. Or vice versa.  You get the idea. There are indeed obvious solutions to be had and clinched by the middle 50 votes within the Senate if only lawmakers had the courage to cooperate.  For instance lawmakers could finally pass a permanent legislative fix for the Obama-era Deferred Action for Early Childhood Arrivals program which provides partial protections to unauthorized immigrants brought here as children. Large majorities of voters in both parties support these immigrants known as dreamers and a bipartisan agreement giving them a path to citizenship almost materialized two years ago. (Until Trump blew up the efforts of course.)  Resolving other immigration issues remains thorny. But making life better for dreamers is low-hanging bipartisan fruit.  Or there are pocketbook issues important to American families.  In an interview Sunday Republican Sen. Mitt Romney (Utah) spoke about his desire to work with the president-elect and Democrats on an expansion of the child tax credit. Romney already co-sponsors alongside Democratic Sen. Michael F. Bennet (Colo.) a bill to make this credit fully refundable and thus available to the poorest households. Other Republicans and conservatives have supported variants of the idea partly because it can help traditional families with one nonworking parent (usually mom); and nearly every sitting Democratic senator co-sponsors related legislation.  Again an easy win-win. Expanding a similar tax break that rewards work (the Earned Income Tax Credit) likewise has a demonstrated record of appeal among both parties.  Other opportunities for bipartisan kumbaya moments include: more funding for community health centers (which help the poor everywhere but particularly in rural redder states). Or paid parental leave (which both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have endorsed albeit with different funding mechanisms). Or covid-19 aid to small businesses.  Or most any effort to rebuild international relationships that have been shredded over the past four years to much hand-wringing from members of both parties.  Voters seem to like the idea of divided government on the premise that it incentivizes such shared victories. This is part of the pitch Republicans are making about the two U.S. Senate seats in Georgia facing runoff elections which will decide which party ultimately controls the upper chamber next year: If Republicans hold the seats the GOP argues they can not only check Democrats most radical impulses but also deliver the moderate outcomes forced through mutually beneficial cooperation that voters crave.  But if past is prologue such promised cooperation is likely to be a con. At least if McConnell continues running the show as he almost certainly would if those Georgia seats remain Republican.  Recall that back in the day Barack Obama also ran on a platform of healing our divides and bringing political harmony to a polarized Washington. Republicans led by McConnell refuted this promise simply by obstructing nearly every Obama initiative on offer regardless of public support. This forced Obama to implement his agenda through executive action wherever possible which led to GOP accusations of executive-branch tyranny. (Those same Republicans somehow stayed mum when Trump exercised even more executive power including when his party controlled both houses of Congress.)  Any opportunities for finding common ground  and for Biden to prove his political healing powers  will be blocked if McConnell again prevents such legislation from even getting a vote. Which he is likely to do at least if he still believes his top priority is to make a Democratic occupant of the White House a one-term president. His support Thursday for Trump to continue fighting the election results doesnt bode well.  Maybe McConnell will ultimately be less obstructive. Were told that he and Biden are old friends after all. But Charlie Brown and the football-wielding Lucy are sometimes said to be pals too.   1996-2020 The Washington Post,political,Facebook

There's a video from earlier today of a person shouting slurs and harassing demonstrators in downtown Sonora. It's not an isolated incident. At the Trump rally someone threw eggs at attendees. Just a few days ago high schoolers were confronted by adults not with an appreciation for participating but disdain.  That type of behavior has no place here and I don't believe the actions of those lone individuals reflects on any substantial portion of this community  but it is representative unfortunately of what portions of our politics have become.  Yelling name-calling humiliating the other side. A few loud voices taking up all the oxygen. Win at all costs. We're good they're evil. We're American they're un-American. It's ripping us apart. It's the biggest reason the country is struggling to come together with solutions. Extreme partisanship is eating away at the foundation of everything we are.  This isn't a left or a right thing.  We as a community and a people need to come together and see our shared values. Politics isn't 'destroying the other side' or mocking them into submission. It's the process for electing leaders to make decisions for all of us and it's important. It's messy it's hard it's loud it's emotional but it's important.  Important enough to fight for the rights to demonstrate speak and assemble freely (without fear of attack coercion or harassment) to hold competitive elections and engage voters . . . these are good healthy things. That's people showing they care about what's happening.  We need a little more love and respect in that process and the level-headed voices and leaders on all sides to stand against it.  I stand against it and if you feel the same share it,political,Facebook
FBI Case #272D-BA-3065729. After an FBI agent opens up a case he then has to write a report every 3 months until the case is prosecuted. So its a real pain to the agent if he doesnt believe he has the evidence to prosecute. In the last debate Trump called Joe Biden the big guy and Biden said there wasnt any corruption with him or his family. The FBI opened up a case on Hunter Biden and the numbers mean it has to do with money laundering (272D) on an international basis. So whats the case about? Go back in time before 2014 and you find that a Minister in Ukraine essentially stole mega-millions of natural gas leases. The government then changed much like when the Obama/Biden administration was replaced by the Trump/Pence administration. As time progressed a prosecutor started asking questions about these natural gas leases of Burisma. Joe Biden travels to the Ukraine and that follows with Hunter Biden & Devon Archer being put on Burismas board and being paid tens of thousands each month. This is then followed by Joe Biden going to the Ukraine and saying if the new administration doesnt fire the prosecutor who is looking into Burisma & Hunter Ukraine wont get the billion dollars in loan guarantees from the US Government. Since payments to Hunter go through several Countries including Latvia this is an international money laundering scheme. Emails indicate that 10% of the money was to go to the big guy which was confirmed to be Joe Biden. Other Democrats are also involved including David Leiter former chief of staff for John Kerry and Chris Heinz Kerrys stepson. Many more ties are exposed. How do we know this is true and not a smear? Hunter Biden has thousands of emails on his laptops. They were damaged and he took them in to be repaired. As part of the contract the repairman took ownership after 90 days unless he was paid. So after the 90 days with repeated attempts to contact Hunter he took ownership. He looked at what was on the laptop and became concerned. He made 4 copies and then gave the laptop in 2019 to the FBI. After no apparent action by the FBI he sent copies to some members of Congress and indirectly to Rudy Giuliani. Rudy had it verified by comparing dates and events to know documents. Rudy gave a copy to the Nations oldest newspaper the New York Post. They independently verified the information and then published 2 articles on what they found. They also mentioned there were many photos of Hunter with an underage girl. Then Hunters attorney attempted to get the laptop back again proving the laptop belonged to Hunter. Meanwhile a former business partner of Hunter named Cooper was in jail lamenting how he was convicted and Hunter and Devon were not. So he contacted Peter Sweitzer and authorized him to take possession of tens of thousands of his emails. Peter found incriminating evidence that corroborated the Post articles. Finally another member of the Biden re-election campaign Bobulinski has come forward and is also corroborating the NY Post evidence. There is a lot more to it and much can be found at under Dans episode 1375. So in summary in the last debate Joe Biden said there was no corruption involving him or his family. He says this while details of corruptions are emerging from the open floodgates. FBI case #272D-BA-3065729 opened emails flood from Hunter Bidens laptop are confirmed by several sources no one denies their authenticity; all pointing to a pay-for-play corrupt Biden family.

"A ""MUST READ"" For Voters!  Key Excerpts from the Statement of former Trump Defense Secretary  Gen. James Mattis'  By CNN Updated Jun 3 2020  (CNN) - Former Secretary of Defense James Mattis castigated President Donald Trump as ""the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people"" in a forceful rebuke of his former boss as nationwide protests have intensified over the death of George Floyd.  ...  Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American peopledoes not even pretend to try. Instead he tries to divide us. We are witnessing the consequences of three years of this deliberate effort. We are witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership. We can unite without him drawing on the strengths inherent in our civil society. This will not be easy as the past few days have shown but we owe it to our fellow citizens; to past generations that bled to defend our promise; and to our children.  We can come through this trying time stronger and with a renewed sense of purpose and respect for one another. The pandemic has shown us that it is not only our troops who are willing to offer the ultimate sacrifice for the safety of the community. Americans in hospitals grocery stores post offices and elsewhere have put their lives on the line in order to serve their fellow citizens and their country. We know that we are better than the abuse of executive authority that we witnessed in Lafayette Square. We must reject and hold accountable those in office who would make a mockery of our Constitution. At the same time we must remember Lincoln's ""better angels"" and listen to them as we work to unite.  Only by adopting a new pathwhich means in truth returning to the original path of our founding idealswill we again be a country admired and respected at home and abroad.

TRUMPSTERS! TAKE HEED!  On Nov 3 we are turning around the The Ship of State! DA 2020 (share if you agree)!  We will no longer tolerate Trumps attacks on the Rule of Law! Yes he claims this mantle for his campaign but in fact his administration flaunts the nations laws at every turn. It began with soliciting aid from a foreign country in the 2016 election Russia if you are listening. continued in repeated violations of the U.S. Constitutions emoluments clause foreign visitors at Trumps DC hotel Secret Service agents staying a Mar-a-Lago at inflated charges at his Scottish Golf Course Turnberry and at another in Ireland. Most recently in using the White House as a campaign backdrop in clear violation of the Hatch Act.  Speaking of lawlessness how many Trump officials or supporters have been indicted convicted etc. Paul Manafort Gen. Michael Flynn Rep. Chris Collins R-NY Duncan Hunter R-CA convicted pedophile George Nader donors Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman and of course Michael Cohen and his un-indicted co-conspirator Donald Trump. You get the picture!  Speaking of such diseases as Trump and his Administration lets examine Covid-19. (He confused it through his Covfefe 17 dementia.) Rather than listen to medical experts he listened to Shawn Hannity seriously Shawn Hannity. Hannity called it a Democratic hoax so being servile to Fox News on February 26 2020 Trump claimed 'that we had maybe 15 cases in the country and that they would all be gone soon.' News Flash! Not gone still here with thousands needlessly dead dead and gone gone forever.  Trump did not lead he followed he followed Hannity. He did not invoke the Defense Production Act to provide ventilators or personal protection he simply claimed that he was not responsible and foisted the virus upon the nations governors. It is what it is!  This is not what real leaders do real leaders step up to the plate they grab a bat they take a firm stance and they take a swing at whatever threatens the nation and the citizens they take an oath to protect. Trump merely bunted because it is all that he was willing or capable of doing. Mighty Casey might have stuck out swinging at Covid 19 but Trump cowardly tried a squeeze play and failed to advance the nations response to the virus. Death death death and massive unemployment and hardship this is the legacy of Trump!  Here we could detail the many additional failings of Trumps Presidency more foul smelling episodes from the Twilight Zone:   Coddling dictators Putin and Kim  Abandoning and demeaning our Allies  Undermining environmental protections  Withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accords  Withdrawing from the Iran Nuclear Agreement  Suppressing voting rights & Undermining Vote by Mail  Refusing to respond to lawful subpoenas for witnesses and tax returns  Kids in Cages  Showing no empathy for black lives  Coddling and encouraging white supremacists  On and  On and  On!  But now we learn consistent with his personality his narcissism his demeaning of John McCain and from multiple sources that our war dead and wounded are Loser and Suckers!  We think not you vile cretin you Agent Orange stain upon the tenants of American democracy.  We are empowered by our vote to reclaim Lincolns better Angels of our Nature; we will not suffer another moment more than necessary at your little hands at your little mind nor through your deaf dumb and blind supporters!  Rather Joe Biden the Joe We Know will fill the void of the past four years with experience intelligence empathy compassion equally capable administrators (not self-serving criminals) and take a swing at all that ails the nation yes including rioters and looters as set forth in his platform.,political,Facebook

Trump claims that he is the ""No. 1 Environmental President"" TRUTH IS his record on environmental protections is abysmal! He has rolled back nearly every environmental protection of the previous administration including allowing fine coal particle wastes to be dumped into ""the Waters of the United States"". (I am a former coal geologist.)  Trump has been claiming that he is the best president for Black Americans since Abraham Lincoln TRUTH IS ""He has said Black People were 'too stupid' to vote for him"" according to his former attorney Michael Cohen.  Trump believes that high stock market values are signs of a healthy economy TRUTH IS stocks are of minimal direct and substantial benefit to the majority of Americans!  Trump claims that he wanted to downplay Covid 19 to not alarm people TRUTH IS he didn't want to alarm stock investors. (Liz Harvey-Ainscough)  Trump thinks that his handling of the Covid 19 pandemic has been excellent TRUTH IS he has done more to kill Americans than protect or provide care to Americans. Not at ~195000!  Trump announced on the eve of the RNC convention that the NIH had approved the use of convalescent plasma as a treatment for Covid 19 TRUTH IS he demanded of Director Dr. Francis Collins ""Get it done by Friday"" two days prior.  Trump thinks the way to address racial inequality is to crack down on protesters TRUTH IS his lack of emphaty and compassion has exacerbated the tensions.  Trump thinks that Americans that gave their lives in service to the nation are ""Losers"" and ""Suckers"" TRUTH IS they deserve the honor and respect of a greatful nation for selfless acts of service and the sacrifice of shortened lives.  Trump believes that women are objects of pleasure or scorn TRUTH IS women have achieved great things are capable of greater things when unbridled and have long earned respect in their many endeavors.  Trump claims to be attracted to beautiful womenTRUTH IS he is more than just attracted to them he has been accused of unwanted ""predatory"" sexual advances even rape by over 24 women (James Anderson). He even admitted sexual assault on the famous ""Access Holywood"" tape.  Trump alledges that Vote by Mail is fraudulent it isn't TRUTH IS he will incite civil war through his supporters if he loses. (PJ White)  Trump lauds positive employment numbers as evidence of economic rebound TRUTH IS millions remain out of work with unemployment over 8% as a direct result of his miss handling of Covid 19.  Trump supporters claim that he is the greatest president of their lifetimes possibly ever TRUTH IS he will be recognized in American history as the one responsible for the collapse of the American democratic model if re-elected.  Trump held a Bible (upside down) on the Washington Mall TRUTH IS he doesn't read the Bible.  Trump is admired by evangelical Christians TRUTH IS he is a serial adulterer profane pro-choice and slept with a porn star when his wife Melania was home with his youngest child Barron.  Trump claimed in 2016 that if he were elected he would too busy to play golf TRUTH IS his golf trips have cost taxpayers millions more than the annual salary he ""donates""!  Trump claims to be a billionaire TRUTH IS he promised but never made good on his promise to release his tax returns.  Trump claims to be an ultra successful business man TRUTH IS daddy gave him his start but he didn't pay contractors sued over or under inflated assets to acquire loans or to minimize taxes. When that failed he filed bankruptcies.  Trump formed the Trump Foundation a charity TRUTH IS he used it to buy a painting of himself pay civil penalties at Mara-a-Lago stole from kids with cancer and eventually the Foundation was shutdown by the State of New York.  Trump claims that illegal immigrants are rapists and murderers TRUTH IS Dreamers those brought here by parents at early ages have known no other country and are an integral part of our economy our caregivers and are value assets to the nation.  Trump is promoting ""heavily edited recordings"" ""disclosed by an Ukrainian lawmaker whom US officials described ... as an 'active Russian agent' who has sought to spread online misinformation about [Joe] Biden that he interfered with an Ukrainian prosecutor to protect his son Hunter Biden and Burisma TRUTH IS V.P. Biden ""was representing the official position of the Obama administration Western allies and many in Ukraine who perceived the prosecutor to be soft on corruption."" The Russians are supporting Trump! AGAIN!  Now this! Trump says if he is reelected that he will ""negotiate"" a third term ""because he deserves it"" TRUTH IS the US Constitution unequivocally limits a person to two terms in the office.  TRUTH IS Joe Biden the Joe We Know is a better alternative. Joe will acknowledge that he is not perfect and has his shortcomings. But the Joe We Know is a man of humility compassion empathy experience insight and free of braggadocio narcissism neither an instigator of hate speech nor a bully. None of the good and all of the bad can be said of Trump and so much more!  TRUTH IS Joe Biden the Joe We Know understands the heartbreak of lost lives understands the economic plight of Americans in this age of pandemic understands what is needed to fight the virus and to return America to a better future. (Simply go to his campaign website it is in black and white.) In contrast the GOP didn't even bother formulating a new convention platform.

February 1 2017 In a rollback of an Obama-era protection Donald Trumps White House withdrew the Mercury Effluent Rule which regulated the safe use and disposal of mercury in American dental offices. The Natural Resource Defense Council estimated the repeal would discharge five tons of the neurotoxic substance into water supplies each year. Even trace amounts of mercury can harm brain function and damage the human nervous system particularly in pregnant women and infants.  65.  February 1 2017  Trump and House Republicans rolled back an Obama-era regulation that required oil companies to provide purchasing information! when buying minerals from foreign governments. Concerned that oil companies would purchase oil from corrupt and violent foreign administrations the SEC had originally said Obamas regulation would combat government corruption through transparency and accountability. The repeal had long been on the oil lobbys wish list and will save oil industry giants about half a billion dollars per year in compliance costs.  66.  February 2 2017  Donald Trump vowed to dismantle the Johnson Amendment a law which restricted churches and other religious institutions from taking a public political stance while retaining tax-exempt status. When following through on his promised repeal proved legislatively difficult Trump signed an executive order encouraging leniency on enforcement of the amendment.  67.  February 3 2017  Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai rolled back an agreement with nine internet service providers that had encouraged ISPs to provide affordable internet access to low-income communities. This reversed the decision of Pais Obama-era predecessor Tom Wheeler and will remove a $9.25 per month credit for low-income households to purchase internet service.  68.  February 4 2017  Donald Trump posted a report to his Facebook page saying Kuwait would institute a travel ban on many Muslim-majority countries. The report was not truthful; Kuwait did no such thing. The Assistant Foreign Minister of Kuwait responded to Trumps false Facebook post: The State of Kuwait believes that granting of visa [sic] is a sovereign matter and is not linked to terrorism or violence or nationality or faith.  69.  February 4 2017  Donald Trump questioned the legitimacy of the federal judge who had blocked his travel ban calling Judge James Robart a so-called judge whose dissenting opinion had taken law-enforcement away from our country. Justice Robart had received a unanimous endorsement of well-qualified from the American Bar Association before his appointment to the bench by George W. Bush.  70.  February 7 2017  The Republican-led House Administration Committee voted to eliminate the Elections Assistance Commission which was the only federal agency charged with ensuring voting machines could not be hacked. Chairman of the committee Rep. Gregg Harper R-Mississippi stated the committee had outlived its usefulness to the nation. Only weeks prior to the EACs dissolution Donald Trump claimed hacks of voting machines allowed 3 million of people to vote illegally in the 2016 election. No evidence exists to support this claim.  71.  February 7 2017  In another rollback of Obama-era policies the House voted to eliminate two regulations on American education: the Teacher-Preparation Rule which ensured new teachers would enter classrooms fully qualified to teach; in addition to the School Accountability Act which evaluated the quality of service American schools provided to their students and distributed funds accordingly. Civil rights advocates have explained that the latter rule was vital to providing education budget for low-income schools and its removal could thereby harm funding for poorer areas of the country.  72.  February 7 2017  Donald Trump stated the murder rate in America had reached a 47-year peak. This was not true. While there had been a slight increase in murders from 2014 to 2015 the murder rate for both years was still more than 40 percent lower than it had been 47 years ago. In 1970 there were nearly 8 murders per 100000 people in America; in 2015 the latest year with full data collected by the FBI that number had fallen to 4.9 murders per 100000 people.  73.  February 7 2017  Donald Trump told a sheriff in Rockwell County Texas to destroy the career of a state senator who had opposed civil asset forfeiture. This controversial law enforcement practice allows police officers to seize cash and assets they believe may be related to a crime even if the property owners were never arrested or convicted of that crime.  74.  February 7 2017  Vice President Mike Pence cast a tie-breaking vote to confirm Donald Trumps appointment of Betsy DeVos as education secretary. At the time of her appointment to lead the Department of Education DeVos had no government experience and no experience working in public schools.  75.  February 8 2017  Despite extreme opposition the Senate confirmed Jeff Sessions as attorney general. Throughout his career as a lawyer and Alabama Senator Sessions had opposed assurances for the voting rights of minorities favored heavy criminal punishments for low-level drug offenders and routinely attacked civil rights.  76.  February 8 2017  President Trump used Twitter to lash out at Nordstrom for its decision to stop carrying his daughters retail brand. He tweeted about the company My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly.  77. February 9 2017  Donald Trump attacked Senator John McCain on Twitter. McCain had raised objections to the Yemen raid wherein one American soldier was killed and five others were wounded. Trump tweeted about McCain Only emboldens the enemy! Hes been losing so long he doesnt know how to win anymore. McCain was a prisoner of war in the Vietnam War enduring torture and solitary confinement after his plane was shot down in North Vietnam.  78.  February 9 2017  When meeting with senators Donald Trump addressed Democrats by saying that Pocahontas is now the face of your party. The racial epithet referenced Elizabeth Warren who has claimed Native American ancestry.  79.  February 9 2017  Three times in one week White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer referred to recent terrorist attacks in Atlanta which never actually happened. The City of Atlanta has not had a terrorist attack in 21 years in 1997 when Christian extremist Eric Robert Rudolph bombed Centennial Olympic Park. After misspeaking for the third time Sean Spicer acknowledged his mistake and explained that he meant to reference the nightclub attack in Orlando Florida in June 2016.  80.  February 9 2017  Senior White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted Ivanka Trumps retail brand while speaking on television in her official capacity as an aide to President Trump. Go buy Ivankas stuff is what I would tell you Conway said on Fox and Friends Im going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today everybody. Sales for Ivankas brand skyrocketed that day almost tripling after Conways appearance. Jason Chaffetz the Republican Chairman of the House Oversight Committee joined ranking Democrats in jointly issuing a letter to the Office of Government Ethics calling for a review of Conways comments. In response to inquiries on disciplinary action for Conway Press Secretary Sean Spicers stated she had been counseled on her behavior.  81.  February 9  2017  Before a day of golf with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe Donald Trump tweeted that refugees were flooding in from the seven suspect countries his travel ban had outlawed and that these refugees were SO DANGEROUS. In January Fox News reported that no terrorist attacks had been perpetrated by refugees from countries on Trumps list.  82.  February 9 2017  Donald Trump knew about Michael Flynns contact with a Russian ambassador for weeks before Flynns resignation as a national security adviser. Reportedly the Justice Department warned Trump about their concerns with Flynn on January 26 2017; Michael Flynns forced resignation did not arrive until February 13 more than three weeks later.  83.  February 11 2017  Donald Trump claimed without evidence that 3 million illegal votes went to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. Politifact and Snopes have both debunked the claimwith Snopes saying the 3 million non-citizens may just as well have been plucked out of thin air. The number appeared to originate from an InfoWars article which sought to explain why Donald Trump lost the popular vote by 2.9 million votes.  84.  February 12 2017  In a televised interview with George Stephanopoulos senior White House policy adviser Stephen Miller reaffirmed Donald Trumps unsubstantiated suspicion of voter fraud in the presidential election. When challenged for evidence by Stephanopoulos Miller replied This morning on this show is not the venue for me to lay out all the evidence. But I can tell you this voter fraud is a serious problem in this country. Miller never subsequently offered any evidence for his claim.  85.  February 12 2017  In a tweet from their official account the Department of Education misspelled the name of W.E.B. Du Bois. In a follow-up tweet apologizing for the error the Department of Education misspelled the word apologies.  86. - February 12 2017  In the wake of Donald Trumps travel ban some international travelers faced increased scrutiny at airports and in some cases were asked to deliver digital information to Border Protection. Sidd Bikkannavar a natural-born U.S. citizen and scientist at NASA was detained at an airport in Texas upon his return from Chile and pressured into unlocking his cell phone for search. Haisam Elsharkawi an American citizen and electronics salesman from Anaheim California surrendered his cell phone after persistent pressure from border control. He said in an interview that border control told him they would confiscate the phone if he did not comply. Elsharkawi said I opened the doors of hell when I asked for a lawyer. They just started attacking me verbally. Why do you need a lawyer? Are you a criminal? What are you hiding?  87.  February 12 2017  After receiving news that North Korea had fired a ballistic missile (the first during Donald Trumps presidency) Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe strategized during dinner in the main dining room at Trumps Mar-a-Lago resort in full view of other diners.  88.  February 13 2017  Less than one month after Trump took office Michael Flynn resigned as national security adviser. His resignation followed the public revelation that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about his contact with Russians. Contrary to what Michael Flynn had told Pence Flynn had discussed Russian sanctions in a December meeting with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.  89.  February 14 2017  Kellyanne Conway told the press that Michael Flynns resignation had been voluntary. Just hours later Sean Spicer said Whether or not he actually misled the vice president was the issue and that was ultimately what led to the president asking for and accepting the resignation of General Flynn.  90.  February 14 2017  The day after Michael Flynn resigned FBI Director James Comey reported Donald Trump requested a private meeting] [BP2] to talk about Mike Flynn. Trump told Comey that Flynn had misled Mike Pence about his conversations with Russian representatives but that Flynn was a good guy. Trump said he hoped Comey could let this go.  91.  February 14 2017  In the wake of Michael Flynns resignation for lying to senior officials and interacting with Russian representatives after the election Donald Trump tweeted The real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington? Will these leaks be happening as I deal with N.Korea etc?  92.  February 14 2017  The House Ways and Means Committee rejected a Democratic proposal requesting Donald Trump release his tax returns Under federal tax law the chairman of the committee can request tax information from the treasury. Chairman of the committee Republican Kevin Brady declined to exercise that power in Trumps case citing invasion of taxpayers privacy rights.  93.  February 15 2017  Vice President Mike Pence falsely stated that no member of the Trump campaign including national security adviser Michael Flynn had contact with Russian officials. Pence publicly defended Flynns phone calls to Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak claiming Flynn did not discuss sanctions against Russia (Flynn later confessed to the FBI that he had). Pence did not realize that Flynn had misled him until two weeks after he made his public assertion well after Donald Trump had become aware of Flynns Russian contacts.  94.  February 16 2017  Donald Trump asked April Ryan an African American reporter and White House correspondent if she would arrange a meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus. After Ryan asked a question about Trump meeting with the Caucus he said Do you want to set up the meeting? Are they friends of yours?  95.  February 16 2017  Staff at the United States Department of Agriculture were given a list of blacklisted terms which the agency would no longer use in their scientific research. The memo instructed scientists to replace climate change with weather extremes and reduce greenhouse gases with build soil organic matter increase nutrient use efficiency. Explaining the decision in an email the Deputy Chief of Programs wrote It has become clear one of the previous administrations priority is not consistent with that of the incoming administration. Namely that priority is climate change. Please visit with your staff and make them aware of this shift in perspective within the executive branch.  96.  February 16 2017  Using the Congressional Review Act Donald Trump repealed the so-called stream protection rule which kept coal companies from dumping mining debris into rivers. Barack Obama first implemented the regulation after a growing body of evidence suggested the debris could contain toxic materials such as selenium mercury and arsenic. Trumps repeal has been on the wish list for the coal industry since the rules publication in December of 2016.  97.  February 16 2017  In the first two months of 2017 Republican lawmakers scheduled only 88 town hall meetings with their constituents. In 2015 by comparison Republicans held 222 town halls during the same two-month period.  98.  February 17 2017  In what has become a regular attack on free press Donald Trump tweeted The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes @NBCNews @ABC @CBS @CNN) is not my enemy it is the enemy of the American People!  99.  February 18 2017  The Department of Homeland Security drafted a proposal to mobilize the National Guard in an effort to arrest undocumented immigrants. While the DHS never implemented the proposal and the White House denied it had existed in the first place (despite the 11-page memo leaking to the Associated Press) Washington lawmakers saw the draft as an indication that the Trump administration was willing to consider military force as a means of rounding up undocumented immigrants.  100.  February 19 2017  The Trump administration asked the Council of Economic Advisers to predict a 3.5% surge in economic production over the next decade. Compared to the 1.8% projected by the Federal Reserve this calculation could be dangerously optimistic. The risk explained the president of the Committee Responsible for Federal Budget is that rosy economic scenarios allow us to borrow trillions of additional dollars in the next couple of years doing real damage.  101.  February 20 2017  Donald Trump signed an executive order that instructed the Bureau of Land Management to lift a moratorium on new coal mining leases for federal land. A full 40 percent of the coal mined in America comes from federal property. In one such state-owned region the Powder River Basin of Wyoming and Montana private companies produced coal that accounts for 10 percent of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. The Obama administration introduced the original moratorium on new mining leases to curb the environmental consequences of coal. Without renewal the current leases would have allowed mining to continue as is for another 20 years; now with Trumps decision to permit renewed leases that timeframe may extend much further into the future.  102.  February 22 2017  The Trump International Hotel in Washington D.C. received an estimated $40000-$60000 for hosting an event held by the Embassy of Kuwait. This violates the foreign emoluments clause of the Constitution which forbids government officials from accepting any present Emolument Office or Title of any kind whatever from any King Prince or foreign State. Trump never divested from his companies and thus has continued to benefit from payments to the Trump Organization.  103.  Feburary 22 2017  Donald Trump signed an executive order halting an Obama-era directive that allowed transgender students to use the school bathroom corresponding to their gender identity. Civil rights groups said the executive order would reinforce a culture of discrimination and could further endanger transgender students.  104.  February 23 2017  Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the Justice Department would renew its contracts with for-profit prisons. This reversed an Obama-era decision to phase out federal use of private correctional facilities. In decades past privately-run facilities were used to address the U.S.s overflowing public prisons which saw the number of incarcerated people skyrocket 800 percent between 1980 and 2013. After Barack Obama introduced a series of significant prison reforms in 2013 (most significantly a directive to lower sentences for non-violent offenders) the Justice Department anticipated less demand for corporate-run prisons as the number of prisoners was expected to dwindle significantly. Because the Trump administration announced a new crackdown on crime Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the Justice Department would need to renew contracts with the private institutions in order to meet the future needs of the federal correctional system.  105.  February 24 2017  After Donald Trumps speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference where he declared certain media outlets to be FAKE NEWS White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer temporarily barred the New York Times CNN and Politico from the daily White House press briefing. While reporters from these publications were not permitted into the briefing the Trump administration allowed entrance for correspondents from Fox News and Breitbart News.  106.  February 24 2017  After Donald Trumps election Republican lawmakers in 18 states proposed new legislation intended to curb mass protests. Among these were increased consequences for protests blocking roadways new punishments for any demonstrators wearing a mask and in Arizona a law which would allow the state to seize the assets of any person attending a protest which later turned violent.  107.  February 25 2017  Donald Trump announced he would not attend the White House Correspondents Dinner. Without further explanation Trump tweeted I will not be attending the White House Correspondents Association Dinner this year. Please wish everyone well and have a great evening! The last president to skip the dinner was Ronald Reagan in 1981 who at the time had been recovering from an assassination attempt.  108.  February 26 2017  The Trump Organization claimed it had made good on its promise to donate all profits earned from foreign governments to the U.S. Treasury. However it provided no evidence of how much it donated or how that amount was calculated. Since his company has accepted payments from foreign governments (see numbers 41 42 63 102 135 210 277 319) Donald Trump may have violated the Constitutions Emoluments Clause which prohibits any U.S. official from receiving gifts or compensation from another nations government. By all recent evidence Trump has neither divested from his companies nor set up a blind trust for his assets.  109.  February 27 2017  In his first budget proposal Donald Trump boosted defense and security spending by $54 billion. He proposed slashing the budget for non-defense spending in areas like education science poverty programs and environmental protection by almost the same amount.  110.  February 27 2017  The Justice Department dropped its long-standing claim that a Texas voter I.D. law discriminated against black and Latino voters. The announcement ended a 6-year period of opposition against the I.D. law indicating the DoJs new priorities under Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the Trump administration. Sessions has a history of favoring controversial views surrounding voter identity once going so far as to say the Voting Rights Actthe landmark piece of federal legislation which protected equal voting rights for minority Americanswas an intrusive act. The new Texas voter I.D. law has long garnered criticism for imposing hurdles which disproportionately affect minority voters. In August of 2017 a federal judge granted a permanent injunction against the I.D. law ruling that lawmakers had created it with discriminatory intent.  111.  February 28 2017  To stop a long string of press leaks Donald Trump approved a rule allowing White House senior staff to examine the cell phones of anyone working in the White House. According to Politico senior staffers invited aides to an emergency meeting wherein the junior staffers had to relinquish all mobile devices for search. Press Secretary Sean Spicer led the charge on the operation informing junior staffers that apps such as Signal and Confideencrypted messaging appswould violate the Presidential Records Act. Spicer warned staffers against speaking to the press about the emergency meetings; the story was almost immediately leaked to the press.

My opponent is now attempting to go down the trump law and order path. It has many allegations based on flimsy notions.  Once again I am far ahead of Len Turcotte. Two weeks ago I offered to anyone in Barrington the final report on the Governors commission on policing in NH. I did this because I respect the citizens judgment after they read the report - which I have. I support the results of this nonpartisan review. Legislation being considered for the next session is directly lifted from those recommendations.  I dont manage from a rigid ideology. I voted in a way to protect sanctuary cities because I am against the current practice of ICE putting kids in cages and separating them from their parents. This is a part of a much larger discussion which I am happy to have with Mr. Turcotte if he decides to leave his foxhole and have a full on open debate.,political,Facebook

"I want to challenge the people who say they will vote for Donald Trump because he is Pro-Life. No. Hes Not.  225230 Americans have already died due to Covid19. That doesnt sound like Pro-Life. And just yesterday: ""We are not going to control the pandemic"" Meadows (Mark Meadows White House Chief Of Staff) told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" Sunday. And yet other countries are controlling Covid19.

Like many of you I am personally against abortion with exceptions for rape incest the health of the mother or the inability of the fetus to survive outside the womb. And just as a reminder there is no such thing as a VOLUNTARY late-term abortion. It Doesnt happen. There are only heart-breaking emergency medical procedures by mothers and fathers who have already decorated their nurseries. They make the very tough decision to terminate the pregnancies due to the mothers life being in danger or the inability of the fetus to survive outside the womb. It is plain and simple a tragedy absolutely not a VOLUNTARY late-term abortion as some misleading Republicans are saying.  Please join me in voting Donald Trump out of office. Im also voting against our Senator Mitch McConnell and Congressman Andy Barr who also claim to be Pro-Life. I hold them responsible for all the Covid19 deaths as well. #VoteToSaveAmericanLives #VoteBidenHarris #VoteAmyMcGrath #VoteJoshHicks Thank you.",political,Facebook

If you have a Mail-In Absentee Ballot and you havent mailed it in I recommend using a Dropbox . Trump has compromised the Postal Service and they are struggling because of the A*****e Postmaster General he put in.  If you plan to vote  in person go early. You will be safer than on Election Day November 3rd itself. There are already long lines. Take a chair  Take water  Take coffee  Take a snack  Take a good book  or several .

"During the Civil War President Abraham Lincoln encouraged a return ""... to the better angels of our nature."" Once again we find the nation in need of a return to ""better""; this would be a means to that end! DA2020  Opinion  This Should Be Bidens Bumper Sticker:  ""RESPECT SCIENCE RESPECT NATURE RESPECT EACH OTHER""  He will need a simple clear message to counter Trumps Make America Great Again trope.  Thomas L. Friedman By Thomas L. Friedman Opinion Columnist The New York Times  June 30 2020  I almost  but not quite  feel sorry for Donald Trump. Hes with two invisible enemies at once  the coronavirus and Joe Biden  and both remain highly elusive the pathogen by nature and the politician by design.  Biden who made a rare public appearance on Tuesday has been wise to stay out of sight. Trump is now in a full-on race to the bottom with himself pushing uglier and uglier positions that appeal to smaller and smaller segments of the American public. Why get in his way?  Of course eventually Biden will debate the incumbent and will need a simple clear message to counter Trumps tired Make America Great Again trope.  I have an idea for Bidens bumper sticker.  As I think about what kind of president Biden wants to be and what kind of president America needs him to be the slogan that comes to mind was suggested to me by the environmental innovator Hal Harvey. Harvey didnt know he was suggesting it; he just happened to sign off a recent email to me by writing: Respect science respect nature respect each other.  I thought  wow thats a perfect message for Biden and for all of us. It summarizes so simply the most important values Americans feel that weve lost in recent years and hope to regain from a post-Trump presidency.  Biden should highlight his commitment to all three values in every speech and interview he gives. They draw such a clear simple and easy to remember contrast with Trump.  Start with respecting science. Trumps obvious disdain for truth-telling is annoying when he exaggerates his crowd sizes his hand sizes the size of his bank account or the size of his election victory.  But his disdain for science has become fatal as were seeing in this widening pandemic. Trump has gone from offering quack remedies like disinfectant ultraviolet light and hydroxychloroquine to mocking people including Biden for adopting the easiest and most scientifically proven method for limiting the spread of the coronavirus: wearing a face mask.  The pro-Trump governor of Arizona where the virus is now spiraling out of control at one point actually barred local officials from mandating that residents wear masks. Thats as crazy as when Trump declared If we stop testing right now wed have very few cases if any.  Think about that: Stop testing. Then well have no knowledge. Then well have no numbers. Then well have no virus. Why didnt I think of that?  Stop testing people for drunken driving and then well have no more drunken drivers. Stop arresting people for shootings and then the crime rate will go down.  Attention fellow Americans this impugning of scientific methods this embrace of conspiracy theories this undermining of truth and data by our president and vice president  this is not happening in other countries. This is not happening in Germany France China South Korea Denmark Canada Israel or Japan. This is a form of American exceptionalism that we never imagined possible.  Were not leading. Were not following. Were lost.  This is Dark Ages stuff remarked Harvey founder of Energy Innovation. A prime difference between the Enlightenment and the Dark Ages is respect for knowledge respect for science. The whole idea of progress requires objectively looking at problems finding and testing solutions and then spreading and using the best of them. Thats how we grow thats how we learn thats how we prosper.  Indeed it is amazing to think that in the year 2020 Biden could actually run for president with an ad that says: I believe in the Enlightenment Newtonian physics and the Age of Reason. The other guy doesnt.  As for respecting nature that has two meanings. The first is to respect the power of nature which Trump has utterly failed to do. She doesnt negotiate. You cannot seduce her or sue her. She does whatever chemistry biology and physics dictate. Full stop. Which means in a pandemic that she will just keep infecting people  relentlessly mercilessly silently and exponentially  until she runs out of people to infect or a vaccine or exposure makes enough of us immune. She also doesnt keep score. Shell make you sick and then blow down your house with a tornado.  Trumps lack of respect for nature may be a political asset for him with his base but its been a disaster for the country. He has built no coordinated national strategy against a virus that demands coordination  because the virus evolved to exploit any cracks in your personal or communal immune system and it pays no heed to the Oklahoma-Texas borderline.  Respect for nature also means understanding that we live on a hard rock called planet Earth with a thin cover of oceans and topsoil enveloped by a thin layer of atmosphere. Abuse that soil junk up those oceans with plastics distort that atmospheric blanket and we will likely (further) destroy the perfect Garden of Eden that has been the basis of all human civilization.  And remember as bad as this pandemic is its just training wheels for the big irreversible atmospheric pandemic: climate change.  The latest evidence? See National Geographic online: An extended heat wave that has been baking the Russian Arctic for months drove the temperature in Verkhoyansk Russia  north of the Arctic Circle  to 100.4 degrees F on June 20 the official first day of summer in the Northern Hemisphere. Thats 100 degrees in the Arctic!  Respect each other? Thats not so easy in the midst of our other pandemic  a pandemic of incivility. You cannot exaggerate the impact on the whole civic culture of having a president who has elevated name-calling denigration and lying to a central feature of his presidency amplified by the White House.  We have social networks whose business model is to elevate and spread the most enraged voices from the far right and the far left and generally bring out the worst in people. Almost every day now some public figure or just everyday American has to apologize for some inane or hurtful tweet.  But this pandemic of incivility is fed by many sources. We have white police officers who feel such a sense of impunity that one of them kept his knee on a Black mans neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds while people were recording him on their phones.  We have a level of inequality that is so endemic that your ZIP code is now a better predictor of life expectancy than your genetic code. Respecting each other means ensuring each others equal access to the American dream  and right now Black Hispanic and white Americans are climbing very different housing education and health care ladders which simply has to be fixed.  And we have a mad gun culture that has way too many young men thinking respect can come from the barrel of a gun. Minneapolis has witnessed over 100 people shot since the death of George Floyd on May 25  a lot of it gang-related.  We have so many important issues to discuss among ourselves right now but for that discussion to be productive we cant just go from justifiable outrage straight to firings public shamings or disbanding police departments  without pausing for respectful dialogue and moral distinctions.  I dont know what is sufficient to get more people respecting one another but I know two things that are necessary. One is a president who every day models respect rather than denigration. Thats Bidens job.  The other is getting people out of Facebook and into each others faces again  not to shout or denounce but to listen. Its important what you learn when you listen. Its even more important what you say when you listen. Listening is a sign of respect. And it is amazing what people will let you say to them if they first think that you respect them. Thats our job.  Respect science respect nature respect each other. Biden 2020.  Its the only way to make America great again.  The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

"Here is todays economic lesson.  Businesses absorb additional costs (such as higher taxes) in 2 ways. 1. Lower costs (usually payroll) or 2. Raise revenue (prices of goods). This also reduces profit margins which slow investment and growth (new jobs).  But how does this hurt the tax payer and not the rich like the democrats keep promising?  Joe Biden says he wants to tax the rich those making over $400000 a year and raise taxes on corporations. Allow me to explain why this will cost you more money than it will cost the corporations and how this is a ploy to get tax payers to pay for more government programs while the democrats can pretend they are not going to tax the people.  (Borrowed example)  Let's say Walmart makes a Billion Dollars a year and Joe decides to take away 10% of that income $100 million. Walmart will pass that cost on to the consumer you and me! However because of the ""New"" tax structure they will need to raise prices about 12% to recover that hundred million Biden took. Not only will you pay higher prices but you will also pay additional sales tax because the retail price is higher. So that 10% old Joe took from the corporations will cost YOU between 12% and 15% depending on where you live. Oh by the way same thing for a $15 minimum wage; business passes those costs on to the consumer as well.  Now you might say well the rich will pay the higher price too and you are right but here is the catch. The average working person spends 98% of his or her income while the wealthy spend roughly 60% of their income.  Taxing corporations shift the tax burden to the middle and lower class but in a sneaky roundabout way. The Liberals know this they are just hoping that you are too uneducated to think for yourself!  In the end the cost of all goods and service will increase and the middle and lower classes will bear the burden!  Don't be fooled by promises of free stuff or more government benefits; there is no such thing as a free lunch. The folks WILL pay for it all in the end. There is no such thing as Government Money the money that the government has was confiscated from We the People!  (End of borrowed example)  There is a reason every American was benefiting from the Trump economy prior to the pandemic. A truly free market without government intervention or taxation grows from the bottom up and benefits the working class more than any other economic strategy.  Get out and vote!",political,Facebook
"Following is a first-hand account of what preceded Trump's photo op at St. Johns Church Washington D.C. on June 1 2020.  It is not hyperbolic to say that 1st Amendment rights were violated on his orders:  This is from GREG GONSALVES to The Reverend GINA GERBASI:  He was on the church grounds handing out water help medics. THIS IS WHAT TRUMP ORDERED TO BE DONE TO PEACEFUL PROTESTORS. Clergy medics & volunteers on the church patio. They were driven off church property without warning & were also gassed. No one bothered to ask permission to use the church.  @GiniGerbasi a priest at St John's Episcopal Church Georgetown Washington DC: Friends I am ok but I am frankly shaken. I was at St. John's Lafayette Square most of the afternoon with fellow clergy and laypeople -- and clergy from some other denominations too."" 1/  .""We were passing out water and snacks and helping the patio area at St. John's Lafayette Square to be a place of respite and peace. All was well -- with a few little tense moments -- until about 6:15 or so."" 2/  ""By then I had connected with the Black Lives Matter medic team which was headed by an EMT. Those people were AMAZING. They had been on the patio all day and thankfully had not had to use much of the eyewash they had made."" 3/  ""Around 6:15 or 6:30 the police started really pushing protestors off of H Street (the street between the church and Lafayette Park) and ultimately the White House. They started using tear gas and folks were running at us for eyewashes or water or wet paper towels."" 4/  ""At this point Julia one of our seminarians for next year (who is a trauma nurse) and I looked at each other in disbelief. I was coughing her eyes were watering and we were trying to help people as the police -- in full riot gear -- drove people toward us."" 5/  ""Julia and her classmates left and I stayed with the BLM folks trying to help people. Suddenly around 6:30 there was more tear gas more concussion grenades and I think I saw someone hit by a rubber bullet -- he was grasping his stomach and there was a mark on his shirt."" 6/  ""The police in their riot gear were literally walking onto the St. John's Lafayette Square patio with these metal shields pushing people off the patio and driving them back. People were running at us as the police advanced toward us from the other side of the patio."" 7/  ""We had to try to pick up what we could. The BLM medic folks were obviously well practiced. They picked up boxes and ran.

The below letter was sent to the Az Star. Its written by the Attorney for the Deputies Association...the largest organization within the department that consists of only deputies and their sergeants. The association that represents the men and women who every day answer your calls for service. In 9 days you will be given an opportunity to right the ship...vote Nanos on Nov 3rd and lets do this! Please like and share with all you know...EVERY vote counts.  THE CASE OF THE ABSENT SHERIFF  I understand the importance of social justice. Border walls are ineffective.  Those were some of the first words that Mark Napier used in our conversation in October 2017. I was in his office that day to discuss the challenges he faced. He knew I was a lifelong Democrat who crossed the aisle to vote for him and he wanted to impress upon me that he understood the wave of reform he rode into office. Sheriff Napier wanted to assure me that the days of harassment and bullying in the Department where over. He assured me that he had a plan to fix wage issues for deputies and corrections officers. Sheriff Napier was polite articulate and engaging.  Since that time Sheriff Napier has been largely absent from the job. His written promises have long been forgotten. He has spent an inordinate amount of time being cozy with Washington politicians. His favorite deflection for his time away from Pima County is  If you are not at the table you are on the menu. He argued that his time working with Washington politicians including those that have put children in cages and diverted military defense funds to build border walls was necessary to protect Pima Countys interests. It has always been a dubious claim. For example Sheriff Napiers appeasement of federal authorities counted for nothing last year when DHS officials infamously rejected Pima Countys reimbursement for $200000.00 to house and feed asylum seekers. It appears we are on the menu nonetheless.  While absent from the office the Department continued to unravel with among other problems runaway attrition. Deputies and corrections officers voted with their feet when they learned that their reform Sheriff was not going to change anything. In most cases the officers either retired early or went to local law enforcement agencies with better pay and work conditions. When confronted with the crisis Sheriff Napier blamed demographics. At no time did he own the problem conduct exit interviews or try to determine the root causes. During the crisis he downplayed the impact on his jail (which was understaffed) and on response times (which increased).  For a time the runaway attrition resulted in a paper savings of many millions of dollars but there has been no analysis of the cost to replace those experienced officers. Retaining experienced and highly trained officers can be a net savings if done properly. A mass exodus is almost always more costly and inefficient.  Undeterred by this failure in leadership Sheriff Napier now claims credit for the paper savings. In the end whether you see blame or credit in the Departments current direction you should give it to the people responsible. When it comes to budgetary issues Sheriff Napier has relegated those tough decisions to the County Administrator. If anybody has saved money for Pima County taxpayers it is Mr. Huckelberry not our sheriff.  This brings us to the coming election. Over the last three years Sheriff Napier has made no secret of his affinity for the Trump administration and its policies. Now however with the Presidents political fortunes in doubt Sheriff Napier is trying to turn the page and once again wear the mantle of a reformer. However Sheriff Napier refuses to publicly denounce the most abhorrent policies and words of Trump himself. Bottom line: if you like Donald Trump you should re-elect Sheriff Napier. If not you will want to make a different choice. Personally I already know enough. I will not vote for a man who wants to pose as a tough border sheriff while neglecting the fundamentals of running his Department.  Stephen T. Portell Attorney,political,Facebook
Is destroying America a winning electoral strategy?  A few years ago I was listening to a gun hating nut being questioned about his hatred of guns. He was posed with a scenario in which his home was invaded by a person who intended terrible harm to him and his family therefore would he not want a gun available in order to protect his wife and children from all manner of harm. I will never forget his response. He said that he would hide in the closet and call the police. It was then added to the scenario that the police would not arrive in time to save his family. As unbelievable as it was he continued to assert that he would hide in the closet and call the police and re-iterated his opposition to guns under any circumstance. The most basic duty of a father and husband is to protect his family with his life if need be yet he was willing to see everyone he loves destroyed before he would violate the rules of his ideology.  I think this story is important because it helps to provide perspective of leftist ideology in general and how that applies to what is happening in America today. This man no doubt loves his family dearly but the destruction of his family is far less worrisome for him than violating his ideology. If a man who loves his family dearly is willing to see his family destroyed in order to promote his ideology what do you think those who hate this country are willing to do to it in order to promote their ideology? Yes they too are willing to destroy it.  For leftist democrats which really means the entire democrat party because it has been taken over by the loons nothing is more important than their ideology and they are determined and always motivated to achieve power over everyone else. Their political philosophy has been described as a secular religion but it really isnt that. To describe it as a religion is an insult to religions. Theirs is a cult. A cult complete with the mindless chants of the Moonies and the destructive nature of Kool-Aid drinking zombies. They literally have taken to the destruction of every American institution that has made it the greatest country to have ever existed the most beloved most sought after for the hope of a better future and the most depended on to ensure a world free of world domination.  They are trying to create as much havoc as possible in all areas of life because they believe that President Trump will be blamed for it causing him to lose his bid for re-election so that they can usher in their leftist agenda which itself will make complete the destruction they have started. They have embraced the rioting looting and destruction of private and public property. They have embraced the violence that has resulted not only in bodily injury but also many deaths to law abiding citizens and law enforcement officers. They seek to drastically reduce the size of police departments or eliminate them entirely. They have been releasing violent criminals back onto the streets with no regard for the safety of law abiding citizens and some of these animals immediately upon having been released went right out and committed rapes and murders.  They are trying to destroy the economy using Covid 19 as an excuse. Typically the President in office receives the blame for a bad economy so they are trying at every turn to keep Americans locked down and businesses closed to the greatest degree possible. They have trampled civil rights closed businesses for so long that some will never reopen. The science is clear Covid 19 is particularly harmful to the very elderly and those in poor health. It is particularly harmless to all other especially children. But the science be damned they have an economy to destroy.  The democrats are trying to destroy our electoral system by doing away with our borders so that anyone can get in who wants in so that they can then be put on welfare and the voter rolls. They want to do away with the Electoral College which was created to make sure that every State mattered in national elections. They want to do a wholesale vote by mail scheme which will ensure voter fraud because ballots will be and have been mailed to the dead and to those still living who no longer live at the address on record. And no absentee voting isnt the same thing as the scheme the democrats want to put in place. Absentee ballots must be requested. Democrats want to send ballots out to every person registered to vote knowing that probably every precinct in this country has well over 100% of actual eligible voters on the voter rolls. If the election is close one crooked precinct or and handful of illegal votes can throw the entire election. Remember the 2000 presidential election? All of the things they want to do lay bare their fake concern about election integrity and voter rights.  They want to destroy the courts by expanding them with leftist judges who will decide cases properly..the left wing way. The courts are probably the most important target of leftists because they know their looney ideas will never come to fruition if it is up to the American people to decide so the courts staffed with leftist judges will be used to force their leftist agenda onto the American people.  They want to destroy Americanism and replace it with tribalism in order to keep Americans at each others throats particularly blacks and whites. Their obsession with skin color ethnicity and religion mirrors that of the KKK. Listening to their commentary that is laden with such references is full frontal evidence of their bigotry and racism.  They wish to do away with the so-called nuclear family a mother a father and children which is the most important institution known to mankind. The one thing that has caused the greatest harm to black families is the absence of fathers yet here is blm advocating for that very thing which is just another example of how black lives dont matter to blm.  This is just a partial list and are just the beginning for the totalitarian left. Make no mistake about it. It is their goal to ruin America for some grander scheme they want to put in place. Worldwide every one of these attempts to create a fair and just society by taking away freedom and personal property rights have failed completely. What makes these leftists so dangerous is their belief of their own superiority over all others just like the KKK. They are brainwashed brain-dead lunatics free of reason and logic who care about nothing and nobody except their ideology the ideology they want to force onto you. Government takeovers are always done by a very small minority of motivated actors who then gain control of the reins of power. There is a largely silent majority who must stop being silent.

An Unlikely Hero  Four years ago I voted for Trump half seriously. Having been told that he had no chance of winning against his felonious rival. I had long ago distanced myself from liberal thinking as issue by issue I saw the faults and failings of that world view. As I would think is true for many people to me Trumps personality is abrasive. As an architect I would say the same for the style of his gold anodized aluminum buildings. Architects tend to make moral judgements about such things. Over the last three years and again issue by issue I have seen that the bad orange man has taken positive actions for the American people. Construction sites abandoned after the crash of 08 are finally resuming work. Foreclosed homes are being renovated and put back on the market. My clients that are mostly member funded non-profits have the confidence to start new projects. He has shown great courage in standing up for the most innocent and fragile human life. He has appointed more women and minorities to positions of power than previous administrations. Though censored by most media he has shown great compassion to those with severe disabilities and support for our veterans that have been all but ignored. Unemployment for minorities is at an all time low. He has taken decisive action on COVID19 and mobilized the private sector. I understand how he is loathed and hated. I was once among those of that mind set that placed style over substance and had a misplaced sense of security in a failed ideology and all encompassing government.

"An American Nationalist Voting Index - The Square Deal  This is part of a series examining the issues in the presidential election. To see other articles in the series visit the website version of this article cited below and click on the 2020 Elections tab on the Home page.  Score Biden-.5 Trump +2  Roosevelts commitment to the working man was born of two incidents of violence in his life that challenged his fundamentally conservative impulses. The first was the assassination of President William McKinley by an anarchist which led to Roosevelts succession to the presidency. The anarchists were the Antifa/Islamic terrorists of their time and arose out of the economic inequality and discontent that were byproducts of the Industrial Revolution. The second was his service with the Rough Riders in the Spanish-American war. TR saw bravery in both poor Cowboys and privileged Northeast elite in the charge up San Juan Hill and believed their government owed them a square deal for that bravery which he defined as follows:  ""But when I say am for the square deal I mean not merely that I stand for fair play under the present rules of the game but that I stand for having those rules changed so as to work for a more substantial equality of opportunity and of reward for equally good service.""  At the same time he expected the average worker to respond by contributing to his family community and country not simply demanding a handout from the government.  In todays economy we need to change the rules on economic concentration trade and immigration to give American workers a real chance to achieve the American Dream of stable and independent financial security. Biden and Trump have verifiable records with successes and failures on these issues.  Antitrust Law  The abuses of Big Tech have revived interest in antitrust policy and exposed its deficiencies in todays world economy. The problem lies in the fact we are still trying to regulate these 21st century monopolies using 19th century laws. We learned in the 2008 financial crisis that allowing companies to become too big to fail created a new form of monopoly rents by allowing elites to privatize profits while socializing their risk of loss. Meanwhile Big Tech was finding new ways to leverage customer data to monopolize the Internet advertising and product sales market.  The Trump Administrations challenge to the ATT-Time Warner merger attempted to build a case against bigness itself by attacking vertical mergers. Unfortunately the DC circuit Court of Appeals upheld the merger on the grounds it created useful efficiencies which completely misses the point. They also recently filed a lawsuit against Google over their use of their monopoly power over Internet searches to raise advertising prices. However they have failed to pursue modernization of the antitrust laws themselves Despite this failure these two innovative suits earn Trump a + .5.  The Obama Administration also had an active antitrust docket and challenged several mergers with limited success. The losses in both the Obama and Trump Administrations emphasize the need for a modernization of the rules. The Democratic House also just released a comprehensive report on Big Techs abuses of their market power that could serve as a start for a re-tooling of the statutes. All of this suggests Biden should be given a +.5 on the issue as well.  Trade  Protecting America and its workers from unfair international trade practices has been an area where the Trump Administration has shined. They understood the importance of a strong manufacturing sector and have not subjugated American policy to the slow and sometimes hostile mechanisms of the World Trade Organization. Alan Tonelson of RealityChek has pointed out that the tariffs against China and others have not prevented the manufacturing sector form succeeding during the pandemic without a loss of jobs (see his post from October 19). At the same time the administration preserved the strategically important partnership between the US Canada & Mexico by concluding the U.S.- Mexico-Canada Agreement. Trump deserves a +1 for these achievements.  Bidens record and positions are almost the polar opposite. He wants to return to the multilateral approach ignoring Americas unique great power interest in preserving its internal economic strength. However he has also said he would relax the Chinese tariffs gradually and only upon concessions from the Chinese. Biden says he would prioritize developing an international coalition to challenge Chinese state capitalism as well. The latter positions reduce his negative score to a -.5.  Immigration  Trumps actions to restrict illegal immigration have been divisive haphazard and often poorly justified on ethnic nationalist grounds. However they have changed the dynamic and started to limit the use of immigrant workers to compete with Americans (see my post Immigration  The New Slavery). However Trump failed to seize the opportunity to pass comprehensive immigration legislation when he had a Republican Congress. Because of this failure he deserves only a +.5 on the issue.  Biden and the Democrats have understandably concentrated on the necessity of legalizing immigrants that have been here for years. They then oppose any real future controls on immigration and would expand the number of HIVB-style visas thus allowing big companies to use foreign workers to continue to pay substandard wages. As a result they deserve a -.5 on this issue.  Conclusion  Many other changes in the rules of the game are necessary to give American workers the economic opportunities they deserve. Mere income redistribution is not enough. Americans simply want their government to give them a fair chance to compete and contribute; in short the square deal that TR believed in and for which he fought.

May 7 2019  The White House blocked former White House Counsel Don McGahn from disclosing records to the House Judiciary Committee. The documents contain information about Trump urging McGahn to fire Mueller. They also reference subsequent conversations in which the president told his former counsel to deny the exchanges.  601.  May 9 2019  At a rally in Florida Trump said How do you stop these people? when referring to migrants at the border. An audience member yelled Shoot them! The president then smirked and joked Only in the Panhandle!  602.  May 13 2019  Trump hosted Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbn at the White House. Orbns actions include installing a barbed-wire fence along the border to prevent impoverished migrants from the Middle East and Africa from entering the country. Trump said of the reactionary politician Viktor Orbn has done a tremendous job in so many different ways.  Probably like me a little bit controversial but thats OK.  And I know hes a tough man but hes a respected man. And hes done the right thing according to many people on immigration.  603.  May 15 2019  The Federal Register published safety rule changes that loosened an Obama-era restriction on offshore drilling. The safety regulation was enacted after the deadly 2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion in the Gulf of Mexico. The changes meant a savings of hundreds of millions of dollars for oil companies which donated large amounts of money to Trumps re-election campaign.  604.  May 20 2019  At a rally in Pennsylvania Trump repeated a claim that the United States has no more room for immigrants. Our country is full. We dont want people coming up here he said. His words contradicted what he said a month earlier: We have companies pouring in he said. The problem is we need workers.  605.  May 21 2019  The Department of Health and Human Services finalized a rule that allowed health workers to opt out of providing medical care if the procedure violates their conscience. Examples cites include abortion gender confirmation surgery and assisted suicide.  606.

May 29 2019  Special Counsel Robert Mueller finished his report and then resigned from his investigative position transferring the responsibility of holding Trump accountable to Congress. If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime we would have said so Mueller said. We did not however make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime.  608.

January 2 2019  In a cabinet meeting Trump said that Russia invaded Afghanistan in the 1970s to stop terrorists from entering the country. They were right to be there he said.

January 9 2019  Trump stormed out of a meeting with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer after the congressional Democrats said they would not back his proposed $5.7 billion border wall.

Because I knew he would say that and after Nancy said no to proper Border Security I politely said bye-bye and left no slamming!  566.  January 10 2019  In an impromptu news conference Trump denied ever saying Mexico would pay for his border wall. I never meant theyre going to write out a check he said.

January 15 2019  A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to remove the question Is this person a citizen of the United States? from the 2020 census.

January 17 2019  Trumps former lawyer Michael Cohen admitted to rigging online polls during the 2016 campaign to make it appear as though the presidential candidate had more support than he did. Cohen said he acted at the direction of and for the sole benefit of Trump.  571.  January 17 2019  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was scheduled to visit troops in Afghanistan but Trump canceled her use of a military aircraft. The retaliatory move came after she urged him to delay his State of the Union address because of the shutdown.  572.  January 18 2019  A class-action lawsuit was brought against the Office of Refugee Resettlement.

What is court packing?  Most of you have heard the ruckus over allegations that Joe Biden will pack the courts if elected and he wont deny it when questioned. Many of you may not know what exactly that means so this is for you. The idea of court packing may go all the way back to the founding of this great country but its most prominent iteration occurred in the 1930s while FDR was president.  FDR had a big problem during his presidency with the courts because they were regularly declaring his New Deal actions and programs to be unconstitutional. This was back when the courts still had some sense of self-control when it came to judicial activism. As a result of all of the push back by the courts against his unconstitutional New Deal actions FDR proposed adding one new justice for each justice that was over seventy years of age which at the time applied to six justices. So the court could have ended up with fifteen justices.  This was an attempt by FDR to appoint justices who would ignore the Constitution and would instead decide in his favor. However politicians on both sides of the aisle came out in force against his plan and it never saw the light of day. It appears that even though his plan was refused by Congress the threat itself was enough to get the Supreme Court to start declaring his unconstitutional actions as constitutional. The change in the courts voting behavior became known as the switch in time that saved nine.  So court packing is the action of altering the established form and function of the courts by appointing additional justices who are political activists in order to shift the balance of power to a particular side. Joe Biden said a day or two ago that President Trump is packing the courts and that it is unconstitutional. Joe Biden doesnt know what planet he is on much less what is constitutional or not. President Trump is filling vacancies and there is nothing unconstitutional about that.  Court packing exposes the much greater problem that the courts to steal a line are simply politics by other means. The courts have been used as a tool by politicians since the founding of this country but it went into hyper-drive in the 1930s. The courts have been given too much deference that has allowed them to exercise judgement and power over things the Constitution or subsequent amendments have not provided them. The courts largely have become a joke and when they exceed their authority there is a remedy and that remedy is to ignore them.,political,Facebook
"This woman Michelle Obama is either really in denial or a poor malicious propaganda artist. She is the one who said ""when they go low we go high"". Nothing could hav been more false. Basically the left say things that sound great but intend the exact opposite and do the opposite. Now she comes out and says that the protests were almost entirely peaceful and Trump is making it up that they are violent to create racial division. Again this is Goebbels speech because she and her husband are doing everything to stir racial divisions and chaos and accusing the other side of that which they are guilty of.The most corrupt first lady with the most corrupt President in history the Obamas are at it again.  If you see racial division and hate of police and violence they ""created it"" Hate of country they created it. Blacks against whites they created it. Poor againts rich they created it.Huge trade imbalances with China Mexico and Canada and other countries they created it. Loss of manufacturing jobs they created it.  The IRS the FBI the CIA the NSA the DOJ were all weaponized against the people for the first time in American history. They created it. They built an America where the youth think that socialism is better than the system that has made this country the greatest country in the world and the super power of the world. They created it.

They cannot criticize him for starting a war. They cannot fault him for the prosperity and wealth he created. They cannot fight MAGA or KAG.They cannot fault him for lack of ""ventilators"" and masks. They cannot say he is not close to having a vaccine for the virus. They can do one thing and one thing only. They can order the fake news and their operatives and their MSM corrupt allies and spinsters and activists and other hypocrite allies to falsely claim that the Covid is ""spiking"" and blame him for doing a terrible job in handling it. They can pretend as though if they were in charge nobody would have died. He acted sooner than all of them despite their criticism yet they say he killed two hundred thousand plus Americans. He acted while they were shamelessly trying to impeach him for no good reason. Any one else in his position would have been totally distracted  They the democrats would have let die millions. Cuomo was one who really caused the death of innocent elderly New Yorkers. Do not pay attention to these false claims of ""spikes"". This too is propaganda and misinformation and political warfare.

The Trump plan increased the state authority to make decisions on coal emission standards saying it empowers states promotes energy independence and facilitates economic growth and job creation.  516.

So Trump gets accused in a fake Russian dossier that had no evidence & was attacked nightly for 3 years by the main stream media how they had evidence. And then they tried to impeach him for a phone call. Now Bidens son has a laptop that is worked on with incriminating evidence on it.

We're in the Endgame Now -- Part II -- A New Hope  Less than three months from now the current terms of office for Donald John Trump and Mike Pence will come to an end. Even a clear Biden win presents many dangers for America. Today I focus on what we might expect in the 79-day Interregnum between the election & inauguration.  Three months ago I published my first Were in the Endgame Now column looking at the final six months of this presidential term using the ten Domino Principles as a foundation to shape my forecast (I have included a link to it in the comments below this posting). That column has so far proven to be accurate and prescient in pretty much every material detail and I must admit it has led to my developing a bit of a Cassandra complex. While we cant predict the specifics of future events with certainty The Domino Principles provide a framework that allows us to assess in broad strokes many of the likelihoods and probabilities for what may occur.  As I write this column there are 15 remaining days until the presidential and Senate election on November 3. The forecasting website presently gives Joe Biden an 88% chance of winning the election and a 37% chance of him winning by a double-digit margin. It only gives a 4% chance that the election will hinge on a recount. It gives the Democrats about a 74% chance of gaining control of the Senate. These projections are reassuring but hardly cause for extreme confidence. Trump still has a 1-in-8 chance of winning which is not trivial. There is still better than a 1-in-4 chance that the Republicans will retain control of the Senate which is still a substantial possibility. The consequences of such possible outcomes are so grim that this is most assuredly NOT a time for complacency.  It is heartening to see so many Americans making their voices heard in an all out effort to save democracy against an existential threat of fascism and corruption and we must be relentless in continuing it for the next 15 days. Not only are Americans turning out to vote in record numbers they are also opening up their pocketbooks in record amounts to provide candidates working to save democracy the resources they need to get their message out. Third quarter fundraising and cash-on-hand announcements for the presidential race and for most of the critical US Senate races show that Democratic Senate campaigns pulled in more than $240 million dollars in Q3 fundraising vastly outpacing their Republican challengers. Joe Biden also raised $383 million for his candidacy in September with $432 million in cash in the bank at the end of the month vastly outpacing Trumps $248 million in fundraising during September with $251.4 million in cash at the end of the month.  A lot has been written about Trumps and Russias efforts designed to interfere in the upcoming election suppress the vote and cast uncertainty upon and dispute the results. In particular Trump is preparing to do everything he can to try to dispute the results in Florida and Pennsylvania if they do not go his way. But at least as of today there is a good chance that despite the success of some voter suppression efforts both of these states may very well resolve for Biden with margins that are beyond reasonable dispute. Meanwhile Arizona North Carolina and Georgia are all leaning slightly towards Biden and there is a realistic chance that Ohio Iowa and Texas could also shift to Biden by the time all the votes are counted. Americans should be prepared for the possibility that votes will not be robustly counted to the point of assessing a winner until days after the actual election.  Lets focus today on looking at what is now the most likely (but by no means certain) scenario for the next three months in which Biden wins the election by a clear margin despite all of Trumps and Russias efforts to stop that from happening. Even this best case scenario is still fraught with many difficulties. If this comes to pass what issues might we expect to manifest during the 79-day Interregnum period between election day and inauguration day?  The Plague  First and foremost of course as winter approaches an America that has not adequately dealt with the COVID-19 crisis is going to see massive infection rates and many more deaths. 220000+ Americans are now dead. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation forecasts that cumulative US deaths by inauguration day will range from 360000+ to 419000+ depending on how much socialization and masking restrictions are further eased. (Note that with universal masking the projected number of deaths by January 20 2021 would be far lower around 298000.)  As Dr. Anthony Fauci has stated I think were facing a whole lot of trouble and This is an outbreak of historic proportions the likes of which weve not seen in 102 years. Advances in testing therapeutics and potential vaccines technologies are indeed making progress but they are not expected to make a significant impact until later in 2021. Meanwhile leadership from the White House in setting standards for protecting Americans wont begin until (and if) Biden takes office in late January.  It still isnt at all clear that Trump is entirely through the medical repercussions of his COVID-19 infection. Should Biden fall ill at some point it would surely create further drama for America.  The Psychopath  As John Bolton stated on CNNs The Insiders yesterday Trump will not leave graciously. In the final days leading up to the election it isnt unlikely that Trump will use threats of the damage he might cause to America to try to persuade people to vote for him or else. Both before and after the election we will also see a continuing stream of people jumping ship to speak out about Trumps crimes and abuses and to claim that they were against it all along. Of course Trump will wage war against these individuals.  Even an obvious election loss will of course be termed a corrupt hoax and conspiracy by Trump. He may deny the reality. He will certainly rage against it. He will want revenge and this time it will be against all of America not just the blue states that voted against him.  A lame duck Trump wont do virtually ANYTHING for America that doesnt provide him a personal reward or benefit. In the best possible light Trump will go AWOL. In the most likely scenarios however he will burn and destroy in retreat and almost certainly engage in vastly criminal and unethical acts to try to cover up the many vastly criminal and unethical acts he has kept hidden so far. He will also surely encourage others to commit such acts and he will likely promise them pardons in return for doing so implicitly or explicitly.  I expect that a lame-duck Donald Trump would see the transition time as one in which he will do everything in his power to bring financial and legal benefit and relief to his business ventures and himself. In the pursuit of such activities I doubt that he would hesitate in the least to make deals particularly with foreign entities that will in a treasonous manner compromise Americas classified secrets along with our national security and our safety.  I dont expect that Trump will agree to do anything with regards to the pandemic or the recession unless it significantly benefits himself and his businesses. After three more months without significant relief for the unemployed and for small businesses a Biden presidency would begin with America seeing massive levels of people losing their homes and their companies. But at least there is some solace in that Joe Biden has experience with this kind of a situation because it is so similar in many respects to the way that his tenure as Obamas Vice President began.  I expect that when the current federal budget continuing resolution expires on December 11 2020 there is a good chance that Trump will refuse to negotiate in good faith on keeping the government open until Bidens inauguration on January 20 2021. There is certainly a chance that the government will be shutdown for an extended period of time perhaps the entire remainder of the Interregnum. But with Trump no longer having any real leverage over most of the Republican Senators it is possible that there will at some point be enough bipartisan support for Congress to override a presidential veto or non-signing thereby getting the government funded again.  While it isnt at all likely if Trumps behavior is outrageous enough it isnt impossible that when the new Congress convenes on January 3 2021 it will be forced to consider a quick impeachment in the House followed by another trial to remove Trump from office in the Senate. This would allow Pence to serve out the remainder of the term as President. Even though the Senate still wont have 67 Democratic votes needed to remove Trump from office it isnt impossible that a Democratic-led Senate would be able to find 15  20 Republicans willing to vote to remove Trump from office a couple of weeks early in order to put an end to the madness. Depending on how crazy things get 25th Amendment scenarios are also more likely in a lame duck presidency. Finally it isnt impossible that Trump might say to hell with America and resign early with the implicit or explicit understanding that Mike Pence will pardon him for his crimes.  The Pardons  My expectation is that it is quite possible that Trump will in some way shape or form attempt to facilitate pardons and/or clemency for himself his family his cabinet and his sycophants for anything and everything that they have done or might have ever done. The outrage and injury to America from this happening will be extensive and shocking.  The Supreme Court  As I mentioned in my column three months ago the loss of Ruth Bader Ginsburg from the Supreme Court before the end of the current presidency could have bleak and long lasting repercussions and could have an immediate effect on Trumps efforts to invalidate an election loss. Unfortunately that possibility has come to pass.  As I write this a rush-through nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to fill Ginsburgs seat is working its way through the US Senate. There is presently a strong likelihood but not a certainty that she will be confirmed to fill that seat.  Two key takeaways from watching this process are: 1) Trump has stated that he is in a rush to fill the seat before the election because he feels Barretts vote on the court could help him if an election issue makes its way to the high court. The implication here is that Trump is extremely uncertain of his ability to retain power against the will of the American people and he is desperate to do everything he possibly can to try to fix the process in his favor. And 2) this nomination is being pushed through in such a rushed manner that the American people clearly see it as yet another effort on the part of the Republican party to pack the Supreme Court with dark-money backed justices who a) place the interests of businesses and business owners ahead of the interests of the American people; and b) lack a dedication to furthering the principles of justice and equality in a manner that reflects the values of the majority of Americans.  Because of these factors my sense is that if Biden wins the presidency and the Senate flips to a Democratic majority then the majority of Americans will support actions such as the expansion of the number of justices on the Supreme Court designed to reflect the diversity and the values of the majority of Americans. Most concerning will be the cases in which arguments are heard or decisions are issued from November through January before any such actions can be taken.  The Transition  In late September Nancy Cook writing for Politico reported that assistant to the president Chris Liddell was hard at work on developing a transition plan for a possible Trump presidency exit. Cook characterized it as one of the most organized and functional parts of the Trump White House. As Cook noted however:  The question is whether Liddell can maintain this level of professionalism if and when Trump starts paying more attention to the prospect of leaving office. Trumps last transition team under Gov. Chris Christie also ran smoothly and made plans for hiring Cabinet officials and rolling out executive orders  until the Trump team fired Christie days after winning and threw his binders of plans in the trash.  I suspect the president is totally unaware one former Obama transition official said about Trump and the transition plans. It could go sideways as soon as he knows this is going on.'  Sideways is a charitable word. My expectation is a full reverse accompanied by deliberate acts of sabotage and surprises as Biden becomes aware post inauguration of secret promises along with a myriad of compromising national security breaches that Trump has engaged in with foreign leaders.  A New Hope  If Biden wins it will be a tremendous vindication and victory for the broad coalition of American conservatives moderates and liberals who have come together to end Trumps all out assault on democracy. Whatever chaos and darkness Trump creates during the Interregnum the shadow from his deeds will occur under the backdrop of the hope and promise of an extraordinarily challenging but also much brighter future one in which a broad coalition of patriots strives to work together to rebuild a better America. It will come at a time at which we will know that Americans faced the greatest challenge to democracy in the history of the country and won.  Americas cultural problems and prejudices once hidden are all in the daylight now. Instead of continuing to witness the continued slow decline in American power and prestige of the pre-Trump era the tragedies of the past four years could become a singular catalyst that puts America on an entirely different and more promising trajectory.  As James Carville recently wrote in A Crusade for Something Noble: I can say with certainty that in all my years joining in this crusade to take America back from the brink of destruction is the greatest thing I have ever been a part of in my life. This election is our one and last chance to say loudly and clearly to the world: this was not who and what we are. This is not who and what America IS. We can be better than this. We ARE going to better than this.  It is with hope and promise that I look forward to the possibility of us exploring together what such a future might bring.,political,Facebook

But If you agree that it is important to share to make Americans aware we trust that you will. DA 2020  MARCH 2018  465.  March 1 2018  The FBI announced it was investigating a Russian oligarch Alexander Torshin for funneling money through the National Rifle Association to Donald Trumps campaign. Torshin who is the deputy governor of the Bank of Russia carries close interpersonal ties to the Kremlin.  466.  March 2 2018  William G. Otis Donald Trumps appointee for the Sentencing Commission which sets policy for punishing federal prisoners has favored abolishing the agency. Otis has also written a variety of racially charged statements on subjects ranging from violence to family structure. In one post on the legal blog Crime and Consequences Trumps new pick for the commission wrote When Fifth Circuit Judge Edith Jones said at a University of Pennsylvania Law School talk that blacks and Hispanics are more violent than whites a consortium of civil rights organizations filed a complaint. The complaint calls for stern discipline on the grounds that the remarks were discriminatory and biased. So far as I have been able to discover it makes no mention of the fact that theyre true.  467.  March 3 2018  Ignoring advice from his economic advisors Donald Trump chose to create steep tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. White House officials said Trumps decision which could result in a trade war was spur-of-the-momentmade without a strategy to alert trade partners without a legislative plan submitted to Congress and without any scheduled remarks beyond an email from the Commerce department drafted late at night on February 28th.  468.  March 3 2018  After Chinese President Xi Jinping altered the Chinese constitution to abolish his term limitsallowing him to retain power indefinitelyDonald Trump was recorded in a closed-door meeting as he said [Xis] now president for life. President for life I think its great. Maybe well have to give that a shot someday.  469.  March 4 2018  With midterm elections approaching the State Department was issued $120 million to combat election meddling from Russia; as of March 2018 they hadnt spent any of it.  470.  March 5 2018  In a move that may violate federal law the Trump Organization ordered new tee markers bearing the official presidential seal for one of their international golf courses. The law in question states the presidential seal or any facsimile thereof may not be used for any commercial purpose.  471.  As of March 2018  Donald Trump and Republicans in the House and the Senate used the Congressional Review Act with an unprecedented frequency. The act allowed the House to remove any regulation within 60 days of its enactment and has been the administrations weapon of choice in rolling back Obama-era regulations. Before Trump The Congressional Review Act had been used only one time; since Trump took office it has been exercised 15 times with dozens more rules proposed for removal.  472.  March 5 2018  The Trump administration announced it would allow hunters to import sport-hunted African elephant trophies on an application-by-application basis. The controversial hunting practice had been outlawed during the Obama administration. The U.S. Forest and Wildlife Service justified the decision by saying that findings on endangered species were no longer effective for making individual permit determinations for imports of sport-hunted African elephant trophies. The findings referenced as no longer effective were published just the year before.  473.  March 6 2018  The US Office Special Counsel announced Kellyanne Conway twice violated the Hatch Act a regulation which prohibits federal employees from publicly endorsing or criticizing candidates running for high-level positions. Conway had been a vocal advocate for Roy Moore in Alabamas Senate race last year speaking on Moores behalf during two Fox News interviews last year.  474.  March 6 2018  Chief Economic Advisor Gary Cohn resigned from the Trump Administration. Though no explicit reason was given for Cohns departure Trump had ignored Cohns long-standing advice against raising steel and aluminum tariffs earlier in the week causing many to speculate this was the impetus for Cohns exit.  475.  March 7 2018  Trumps chief of the U.S. Forest Service Tony Tooke resigned after allegations of sexual misconduct. PBS had released conversations with 34 women from the Forest Service discussing a culture of discrimination and sexual harassment. After the documentary aired it appeared Tooke was among those accused of sexual misconduct. The chief resigned from his post in an email to the agency. Tookes appointment occurred in August 2017 at the direction of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue.  476.  March 7 2018  Donald Trumps son-in-law Jared Kushner met with Mexican President Enrique Pea Nieto without the current US Ambassador to Mexico Roberta Jacobson. Kushner had almost no experience in international diplomacy while Jacobson served the US Government for 31 years as one of the nations leading experts on Latin America. Columbia Universitys Christopher Sabatini told the New York Times The sending of the presidents son-in-law  someone with no experience in Mexican-U.S. relations  is another example of the de-professionalization and personalization of diplomacy that will hurt U.S. interests and leverage in the region.  477.  March 7 2018  During questioning former Communications Director Hope Hicks revealed that two of her email accounts had been hacked and she still could not access either account. One of the hacked email addresses served as her primary contact while campaigning for Trump and the other was a personal address. Both the identity of the hackers and the sensitivity of the compromised information remained unknown.  478.  March 8 2018  The AP reported that one-third of the 59 people appointed to the EPA by President Trump have direct ties to fossil fuel companies either as registered lobbyists or as lawyers for chemical manufacturers.  479.  March 8 2018  The Interior Department planned to spend $139000 on six doors for Secretary Ryan Zinkes office.  480.  March 9 2018  EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt wanted to hold a series of public debates on whether or not climate change was real. Chief of Staff John Kelly deemed the debates unwise and told Pruitt to drop the idea according to White House officials. Those in the meeting with Kelly and Pruitt said Kelly considered the debates a distraction from the Trump administrations rollbacks of Obama-era legislation on climate change.  481.  March 10 2018  Donald Trump advocated for the execution of drug dealers as a means of addressing Americas drug problem. The previous year Trump was complimentary of Philippines President Rodrigo Dutertegoing so far as to invite him to the White Houseafter Duterte had been condemned by human rights groups for his extrajudicial killing of Filipino drug dealers.  482.  March 10 2018  Trump announced the US military would stage a military parade in Washington D.C. for veterans day in November 2018. After a trip to Paris for Bastille Day which included a French military parade Trump returned to the U.S. inspired to hold one himself. Criticism of the idea came from both sides of the aisle. At the very least it was considered a waste of resources as the parade will likely cost between $10 and $30 million.  483.  March 12 2018  House Republicans declared the Mueller investigation had failed to find any collusion between Donald Trump and the Russian. The statement released by the House Intelligence Committee was not reviewed by any of the Democrats on the committee before its publication. Rep. Adam Schiff one of the ranking Democrats on the committee tweeted BREAKING: GOP just shut down House Intel investigation leaving questions unanswered leads unexplored countless witnesses uncalled subpoenas unissued. If Russians have leverage over the President GOP has decided that it would rather not know. The minoritys work continues:  484.  March 12 2018  Department of Education head Betsy DeVos was interviewed on 60 Minutes and admitted she hadnt visited any underperforming schools and did not know basic public school statistics in her home state of Michigan.  485.  March 13 2018  Donald Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Trump had clashed with Tillerson in the past on everything from the Iran nuclear deal to issues of personal chemistry. In October it was rumored that Tillerson had called Trump a moron to senior staff members. To replace Tillerson Trump chose CIA Director Mike Pompeo who the president described as having a very similar thought process.  486.  March 20 2018  A citizen watchdog group named Public Citizen filed ethics complaints regarding significant conflicts of interest for 36 appointees in the Trump administration. These conflicts of interest in the administration violated Trumps own rules for ethical standards. In Executive Order 13770 Trump declared all federal appointees should pledge the following: If I was a registered lobbyist within the 2 years before the date of my appointment in addition to abiding by the limitations of paragraph 6 I will not for a period of 2 years after the date of my appointment participate in any particular matter on which I lobbied within the 2 years before the date of my appointment or participate in the specific issue area in which that particular matter falls. The Public Citizen attached a comprehensive report to each complaint which provided the full list of 36 individuals who were suspected to have violated Executive Order 13770. (  487.  March 22 2018  Donald Trump may have stoked a trade war with China by imposing tariffs on up to $60 billion worth of Chinese goods. While Chinas theft of American intellectual property has long struck economists as a serious problem in the economic relationship between the two world powers many economists viewed Trumps decision to impose tariffs on Chinese goods as a poor strategy for addressing the issue. Jason Furman an economist at Harvards Kennedy School of Government said Any good strategy has to include getting other countries on your side. If its the United States versus China were similar sized economies. If its the United States and the world versus China thats not something China can win.  488.  March 22 2018  Trump fired national security adviser General H.R. McMaster replacing him with former Fox News pundit John Bolton. McMaster and Trump had clashed frequently with McMaster telling Secretary of Defense James Mattis He treats me like a three-star rather than a coequal (McMaster is a four-star Marine Corps general). McMasters replacement John Bolton was in Trumps original consideration for the position but lost the spot because the president didnt like his mustache. The new hire would likely affect U.S. strategy for the upcoming diplomatic talks between the United States and North Korea as Bolton has long expressed hawkish views on North Korea. As recently as February 28 2018 Bolton wrote about the futility of conversation with North Korea favoring pre-emptive strike as the only viable option for the United States.  489.  March 25 2018  Ever since Trump was $1.6 billion in funding for his proposed border wall the president has privately argued for the construction funding to come from military budget. He then tweeted ""Because the $700 & $716 Billion gotten to rebuild our military many jobs are created and our military is again rich. Building a great border wall with drugs (poison) and enemy combatants pouring into our Country is all about national defense. Build WALL through M!  490.  March 26 2018  The Census Bureau announced it would include a question regarding citizenship status on the 2020 U.S. Census. The question hasnt been on the census since 1950. Critics of the move explained the question would discourage undocumented immigrants from responding to the census and thereby skew the population data significantly. The information gathered in the census has a bearing on everything from government policy to funding to boundaries for voting districts. Almost immediately the State of California sued the Trump administration over the constitutionality of the question. The Constitution states a census or actual enumeration must take place every 10 years and the enumeration must include the number of free persons. The State of California alleged this would include citizens and non-citizens alike.  491.  March 26 2018  Donald Trump kept in touch with Rob Porter after Porter left the White House amid credible allegations against him of domestic abuse from two of his ex-wives. In the final few weeks of March Trumps phone calls with Porter became increasingly frequent with some speculating Trump would bring Porter back to the White House soon. (March 25 2018)  492.  March 28 2018  The EPA sent an internal memo to staff describing a list of approved talking points downplaying the certainty of climate change. These included statements like ""While there has been extensive research and a host of published reports on climate change clear gaps remain in our understanding of the role of human activity and what we can do about it.

June 11 2017  Breaking with a longstanding custom Donald Trump tried to cultivate a personal relationship with a federal prosecutor Preet Bharara after the 2016 election. Months after his firing Bharara reported a sense of dj vu listening to James Comeys testimony regarding Trumps bizarre interactions.

He was fired the following day.  248.  June 13 2017  Since the election 70 percent of the properties purchased from the Trump Organization have reportedly sold to anonymous LLCs rather than identified people.

June 25 2017  Donald Trump tweeted Hillary Clinton colluded with the Democratic Party in order to beat Crazy Bernie Sanders. Is she allowed to so collude? Unfair to Bernie! At the time Trump was under investigation for colluding with Russia to influence the 2016 election.  263.  June 26 2017  Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke flew on a charter plane from Las Vegas to his hometown in Montana which cost taxpayers $12375. Zinke and his staff used private and military aircraft multiple times.  264.  June 27 2017  Scott Pruitt and the EPA rolled back Obama-era protections that ensured drinking water was clean and safe for consumption.  265.  June 27 2017  The Trump Organization framed a March 1 2009 cover of Time magazine and hung it on the walls of at least five Trump resorts. The cover features Trump with his arms crossed beside the headlines Donald Trump: The Apprentice is a television smash! and TRUMP IS HITTING ON ALL FRONTSEVEN ON TV! Time magazine has confirmed the cover is fake.  266.  June 29 2017  Donald Trump attacked TV news host Mika Brzezinski on Twitter saying he had once seen her when she was badly bleeding from a face-lift.  267.  June 30 2017  MSNBC news anchors Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski alleged the White House tried to blackmail them with an article about their relationship in the National Enquirer. The newly engaged co-anchors claimed they had texts and phone records from Trump advisers threatening to publish the Enquirer article if the pair did not contact Trump directly. The president apparently sought an apology for the couples unfavorable news coverage. Trump is a long-time friend and ally of David Pecker the publisher of the National Enquirer and had leveraged the relationship before. The Enquirer then published a hit piece on Scarborough and Brzezinskis relationship.  268.  June 30 2017  For the position of senior adviser in the Office of Gender Equality and Womens Empowerment Donald Trump appointed an activist who led a campaign to restrict transgender access to bathrooms. Under the Obama Administration the Office of Gender Equality supported LGBT empowerment both domestically and abroad. Bethany Kozma the activist and new senior adviser has said in the past With Trump we now have a president who is focused on remedying the lawlessness of the previous administration.  269.  June 30 2017  Referring to the Houses passage of a second repeal-and-replace bill Donald Trump tweeted If Republican Senators are unable to pass what they are working on now they should immediately REPEAL and then REPLACE at a later date! If Obamacare were repealed without an alternative to replace it 32 million Americans would lose health care coverage.  270.  June 2017  Two anonymous White House officials told the New York Times that Donald Trump said Haitians all have AIDS and Nigerian immigrants wouldnt ever go back to their huts. Newly released immigration statistics which reported 15000 Haitian immigrants had entered the U.S. since he took office reportedly ignited President Trumps tirade. While the White House subsequently denied Trump had used the words AIDS and huts it did not deny the overall description of the meeting.  271.  June 2017  The Trump International Hotel in Washington D.C. received $270000 in payments from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for rooms catering and parking as part of a lobbying effort. This violates the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution which forbids government officials from accepting any present Emolument Office or Title of any kind whatever from any King Prince or foreign State. Donald Trump has retained an ownership interest in his businesses and thus could receive payments from foreign states. 239.

What is court packing?  Most of you have heard the ruckus over allegations that Joe Biden will pack the courts if elected and he wont deny it when questioned. Many of you may not know what exactly that means so this is for you. The idea of court packing may go all the way back to the founding of this great country but its most prominent iteration occurred in the 1930s while FDR was president.  FDR had a big problem during his presidency with the courts because they were regularly declaring his New Deal actions and programs to be unconstitutional. This was back when the courts still had some sense of self-control when it came to judicial activism. As a result of all of the push back by the courts against his unconstitutional New Deal actions FDR proposed adding one new justice for each justice that was over seventy years of age which at the time applied to six justices. So the court could have ended up with fifteen justices.  This was an attempt by FDR to appoint justices who would ignore the Constitution and would instead decide in his favor. However politicians on both sides of the aisle came out in force against his plan and it never saw the light of day. It appears that even though his plan was refused by Congress the threat itself was enough to get the Supreme Court to start declaring his unconstitutional actions as constitutional. The change in the courts voting behavior became known as the switch in time that saved nine.  So court packing is the action of altering the established form and function of the courts by appointing justices who are political activists in order to shift the balance of power to a particular side. Joe Biden said a day or two ago that President Trump is packing the courts and that it is unconstitutional. Joe Biden doesnt know what planet he is on much less what is constitutional or not. President Trump is filling vacancies and there is nothing unconstitutional about that.  Court packing exposes the much greater problem that the courts to steal a line are simply politics by other means. The courts have been used as a tool by politicians since the founding of this country but it went into hyper-drive in the 1930s. The courts have been given too much deference that has allowed them to exercise judgement and power over things the Constitution or subsequent amendments have not provided them. The courts largely have become a joke and when they exceed their authority there is a remedy and that remedy is to ignore them.,political,Facebook
AN AMERICAN NATIONALIST VOTING INDEX Speaking Softly  Biden -2.5 Trump +1.5  While Theodore Roosevelt often engaged in bellicose rhetoric his foreign policy while president relied more on negotiation and adroit diplomacy to advance American interests. For example Roosevelt relied on his diplomatic connections more than military power in avoiding an intervention by Germany in Venezuela to collect overdue debt. TR knew US foreign policy needed to change to adapt to new challenges. In his time it had to adapt by becoming more active in the world.  As I mentioned in my posts on the History and Future of Nationalism the world has changed again. The pursuit of liberal hegemony since the end of the Cold War has proven to be unsustainable. Meanwhile the rise of China Russia India and other regional powers ushered in a dynamic multi-polar system. Trumps election in 2016 was a repudiation of the liberal model. Much of the change since then has been simply talk but talk in foreign-policy can also be substantive. Nevertheless foreign policy remains one of the sharpest contrasts between the two candidates.  Realist Foreign Policy  As I have argued previously the new National Security Strategy promulgated by Trump in 2018 is one of the most important and least understood changes in modern American foreign policy. It rejects the globalist liberal crusade to spread Western values throughout the world and expressly adopts the realist strategy which holds that international relations is a contest among nations especially great powers and that Americas only foreign policy goal should be to preserve its own national security and way of life. The text has its flaws but it remains a watershed moment in recent history. Trump deserves a +1 for this achievement  In contrast Biden supported the liberal globalist model in the Senate and as part of the Obama Administration. There are encouraging signs that some of his current advisors recognize the failures of this strategy as discussed in an article from the DefenseOne website. However both Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris still focus on human rights rather than the real economic and geopolitical dangers we face. Thus a Biden-Harris Administration would most likely return to the liberal model and so deserves a -1 rating.  NATO Expansion  The American commitment to NATO is based the post-World War II socioeconomic weakness of Europe in the face of looming Soviet Communist expansionism. It is past time to reduce our commitment since Europe now has the capability to defend itself against Russian aggression. President Trump has talked about this but his substantive policy has been quite the opposite. Much handwringing occurred when the administration announced the withdrawal of 9000 troops from Germany. However instead of coming home they are destined for redeployment in Poland. Moreover we agreed to admit North Macedonia a tiny remnant of the old Yugoslavia to NATO and thus to defend it even though it has no relationship to any real threat to the US. Trump thus has failed to accomplish anything of substance in this area and deserves a zero.  However Bidens stated policy is worse. As the DefenseOne article mentions he supports releasing Europe from the goal to increase their defense expenditures to 2% of GDP in exchange for cooperation on China and Middle Eastern issues. This ignores the fact that Europeans have very different views on those issues. This would allow them to piggyback on our defense support while giving up little in return. It thus earns Biden another -1.  Withdrawal from the Middle East  Perhaps nowhere has liberal hegemony failed so disastrously as in the Middle East. Rather than attempting to solve its centuries-old intractable problems we should be supporting the development of an internal balance of power and become simply an offshore balancer (see this previous post). Unfortunately neither candidate embraces this approach. Trump abandoned the JCPOA with Iran that controlled its nuclear development and instead threatened military action. He has reduced but not eliminated the number of combat troops in Syria and Afghanistan. On the positive side the administration engineered the recognition of Israel by the UAE and encouraged its tacit alliance with Saudi Arabia. This lays the groundwork for a balance of power in the region between an Arab-Israeli coalition vs. Iran. However the lack of strategic coordination between all these policies earns Trump only a zero on this subject.  Meanwhile Biden supports trying to renew the JCPOA but calls Saudi Arabia a pariah state. While supporting military withdrawal from Afghanistan and the Middle East in principle he then conditions it on effective control of Al Qaeda and the Islamic State. Immigration and economic sanctions would be as effective in preventing them from attacking the US. Bidens approach does nothing to achieve a realist solution in the region and thus earns him a zero as well.  China  China presents a multifaceted geopolitical trade and domestic challenge. President Xi Jin-Pengs increasingly totalitarian rule and bid for world power came as a shock to globalist elites. It would not have surprised anyone with any knowledge of Chinese history and culture. President Trump rightly alerted the world to the danger and has successfully controlled some of their influence notably through his campaign against Huawei. However he has failed to build the global consensus necessary to effectively contain the threat. He rates a +.5 for his efforts.  In contrast Biden has minimized the threat and was part of an administration that navely coddled China and allowed the US to become dangerously dependent on it. The DefenseOne article suggests that his advisors now realize these errors and accept the need to respond. However given the former Vice-Presidents past attitudes he must be assigned a -.5 on this issue.  Conclusion  There is no question that there are fundamental differences between the philosophies of the two presidential candidates on foreign policy. Biden has been part of the globalist establishment for years while Trump has challenged it though often by word rather than deed. A future strategy must be based on the realism and restraint  speaking softly not primarily by force  to be both sustainable and successful in the 21st century world.

Dear Trump voter -  Can we talk? We promise to be civil and reasonable. No name calling cussing lies or false argument.  Were not lifelong liberal Democrats. We are libertarian Republicans. We believe in personal and economic liberties. Free minds and free markets.  Yes we support Biden and you support Trump. But whoever wins what do we do after the election? We have to live together but we dont even speak the same language anymore. We try to understand each other but we cant.  Our society no longer treasures the truth learning education reason and sound argument common sense. Most political conversations now consist of slogans and insults.  But history matters. Constitutional law is important. Political philosophy is good. Defined terms. Sound premises. Logical conclusions. These arent political; these are the foundation of our American society.  We hope you will read this letter think and answer us. A personal email address is provided below. And we will try in turn to engage you. Our country and maybe even the planet depend on it.  We are in despair. Why? Because we cant hug our adult son our only child. Because we cant see our 87-year-old mother who said on the phone to us: The world is wrong. Just so wrong. Everything is wrong.  Viruses arent political but politics can affect them. No the President isnt responsible for the virus but he is responsible for not addressing it early not addressing it properly and for keeping the truth from us.  The virus is a real virus; the numbers are real. We know people who have died almost died have heart damage suffered. Its not a hoax.  We ache every time Trump takes the true meaning of freedom and turns it into a faux freedom like not wearing a mask. (If you think about it freedom doesnt include the right to recklessly endanger others.)  We are in despair because we are on track for more unnecessary deaths from this pandemic the loss of so many individual souls passing alone dying of suffocation wondering why and how it came to this in America.  But lets leave all that for a moment.  We despair over the corruption too. Trump took your campaign donations for his personal use. He uses his government position to line his own pockets. He has no sense of conflict of interest or transparency  what the heck is in those tax returns anyway?  We also cringe every time he alienates an ally and embraces a dictator; every time he misapplies the great constitutional principles of due process and free speech; every time he confuses the rule of law with law and order  destroying the first and exploiting the second; every time he politicizes the independent judiciary; every occasion where he is ignorant of separation of powers federalism and all these essences of our Republic.  But the epitome of our despair is the hatred. Trump has insulted women the disabled soldiers anyone who disagrees with him. He is just plain mean. He has incited violence telling police to rough people up even as police brutality becomes an increasing problem that tears us apart. He takes the worst of our history and ourselves and ignites it for his own power and advantage.  No matter what you think of the Black Lives Matter movement most of the protesters are peaceful. We know because we are two of them. We protesters are simply upset that police are killing too many people  in a free society cops dont get to be judge and executioner. We believe in individual liberties and justice just like you do.  But even if we Americans dont agree on the things weve mentioned above dont we agree on the right to live even for the elderly? On truth decency and kindness? Or maybe we can go further and agree on constitutionalism saving the monarch butterfly or a free (if irritating) press?  Surely we agree on something. And if we do we beg you to reconsider your support for Trump. Because he is against all of these fundamental American  and human  principles.

Just to show the hypocrisy - President Trump gets his taxes released illegally by New York Times. It get splashed all over social media & MSM regarding his paying only $750 on these returns and that he owes $400 million dollars. If you know taxes he has paid millions like we have paid thousands. We still have no idea who released these to the New York Times. I guess I didn't see the Twitter or Facebook limiting the spreading of this news article. He got asked about these at the last townhall. But we get Hunter Biden's laptop emails come out and these get slapped warnings and bans regarding their legitimacy. A man shows up and claims these; has documentation for the laptop; others validate their accuracy. But still restrictions. You wonder who is supporting the Democratic Party hmm?,political,Facebook

A person in my life said that the Coronavirus debacle was a just a S*** Sandwich and that Trump is just Doing the Best That He Can.  What I couldnt say at the time and thought better to not agitate him was this:  Given the evidence that the ENTIRE PLANET was infected with this virus and that nearly every developed nation that used reasonable measures in prevention by following the advice of professionals in the field have lower infection rates per capita and lower overall fatality rates. Despite having a first world medical industry and top rated immunology research facilities I have to sternly object to the idea that Trump was just doing the Best that he can and implying that this would have happened regardless of who was in office.  First his ban on China was at best an amateurish attempt to prevent the virus from coming into the country not thinking about the 40000 people that were in China and that are residents of the United States would immediately come home to all points of the country in a panic. Plus his attempt to ban travel from Europe but NOT the UK. That managed to allow the virus to seep in from the Atlantic side.  Next no national testing contact tracing quarantine or masking protocol was put in place though these protocols were left in a pandemic playbook for future administrations by the Obama Administration. Trump arrogantly decided that he knew better than Obama on these matters despite Obamas record of response that was clearly superior to Trumps in nearly every way with the three epidemics during his eight years in office.  Finally Trump falsely claimed that the National stockpile was bare that there was no Playbook that it would just Go Away and that No One Could Have Known but these claims have been fact checked by multiple sources and found to be False Mostly False or Pants On Fire. Additionally Bob Woodward Pulitzer prize winning journalist has it on tape proving that he lied to the country about knowing how severe the virus is how lethal it is how communicable it is and how it is transmitted from one person to another. He literally knew all of these factors and delayed the national public response by Playing it Down in deference to our economy in a narcissistic endeavor to assure his reelection.  So what has Trump done exactly in terms of the Coronavirus that was so wrong?  Considering that he lies nearly every word that comes out of his mouth he is flagrantly incompetent and reckless with his public speaking when matters of national interest are involved. His obsession with showing the world that he is a better President than his predecessor has demonstrably shown that he is anything but. His complete disregard for Plans and Procedures that have been endorsed by experts in the field in favor of just going By His Gut has turned a small panic into a nationwide catastrophe where the United States having only 4% of the worlds population has 25% of the worlds fatalities directly due to Covid-19. His decision process has shown to be short sighted impulsive and disregarding of scientific reality.  No Trump is not doing the Best That He Can. He isnt even trying.,political,Facebook

Oct 16th 2020 7:00 AM  Morning Note: Pause..Do not Panic..  Over the last 30 days I have received calls from non-clients as well as run into investors in the community and I am hearing an alarming trend.  The common theme is the selling of portfolios before the election. I have heard different stories that the market could crash if one party controls the legislative and executive branches.  However some investors' justification does not have a firm rationale.  If investors are contributing to their 401k or 403b and are focusing on the long term events like this should not worry them. If the stock market had a correction then employees would see their contributions buying more shares of a mutual fund during any decline.  Regardless of events investors should review their investments and re-balance their investments on a semi-annual or annual basis.  During these election cycles I explain that there are always some investments that perform better under one administration than another. But it never hurts to review the politics and make some adjustments to any portfolio during those times.  If investors look back to late 2016 we had a similar situation with a pullback in the market. There were investors that sold their investments after election night thinking the market would go into a free-fall.  Those investors missed out on a tremendous rally that took place in 2016 and 2017. Some investors did not want to pay a premium to get back into the market and watched from the sidelines as the market continued to run-up.  2020 has been a strong year for some investments but there have been several sectors that have not done well.  Recently I received a call from a company asking me to review their 401k plan to see if we could recommend something that was better.  As I explained to the CFO the plan had limited choices and employees had little to no on-going education about investing.  This was a major part of the problem for the plan but the overall performance of the funds and the high fees were not helping either.  All in all it led to some employees investing too conservatively some being too aggressive and some to invest only in the money market because they were just nervous.  At my firm our clients have a strategy for the upcoming election but it does not entail throwing the baby out with the bathwater.  I always remind people selling everything and sticking your head in the sand is not a strategy. In todays world placing your money in a bank and getting zero to a half a point is not going to get a person to their goal.  For example if there is a so-called blue wave that sweeps the elections I can see several scenarios occurring. In one of those scenarios if a stimulus deal is not reached prior to the election I could see a much larger stimulus package passed by the Congress and that action would have a positive 6 -12-month impact on the market.  I could see a rally that could last during that period. So if investors chose to sell everything they would miss out on the rally like 2016-2017. While I am not saying that this will occur the possibility does exist.  After the 6-12 months I could see factors like taxes and other political issues coming to the forefront and that would require additional research before I could decide on a possible new course.  I believe everyone should speak to their financial advisor or any financial advisor before making a radical decision to sell everything because of an election outcome.  Election outcomes tend to affect Wall Street in unpredictable ways.  As I mentioned earlier the market sold off for a day or two after President Trump won the election but then staged an impressive run for the next two years.

"Thank you Lucy for your Letter to the Editor and calling this out.  THE CHOICE IS OURS To the Editor: I am guessing that we are all sick and tired of politics at their worst and are looking forward to being on the other side of Nov. 3. This election cycle has brought out the best and the worst in politics but the worst has dropped to lows that we couldn't have imagined and hopefully will not be exposed to again in our lifetimes. And that is where we have the power. On a national regional and local level the stooping has been consistent exhausting and impossible to avoid. Unfounded claims have been made about candidates in all three races in New Hampshire. This is typical of the tactics that the Trump campaign uses. If you label the other side whether honestly or not eventually with enough repetition the label sticks an association is made. It's bad enough that we must endure this on national and state levels but it feels like a toxic invasion when it happens on our home front. There have now been three different tactics used (that I am aware of) to bash Sue Ford who is running as the Democratic candidate for to be the State Senator for District 1 in New Hampshire our district. The first occurred before the primaries when I received a ""polling"" call. I was assured that it was a neutral poll when I asked and when it clearly favored Democratic positions I stopped it and was told to see it out. It then did a complete turn-around and bashed Sue Ford while praising Erin Hennessey. This technique is referred to as pacing and leading and is sheer manipulation. I was so surprised that the NH Republican Party would invest in this tactic on a local race. The second sleazy ploy in this race was to mail out a flyer to voters in the district that slammed Sue Ford. Just imagine how many people received this and took it as the truth. And just imagine how much money the NH Republican Party spent on pure negative politics during this time of crisis and stress. And the third attack angle is currently happening on social media. An ad on the New Hampshire Senate Republicans Facebook page attacks Sue Ford and if explored one can see that it is ""Paid for by NH Senate Republicans PAC Chuck Morse Chairman"". Morse is the current NH Senate Minority leader. The ad features a website that is anti-Sue Ford and attacks her for voting for the Family Medical Leave Act a protection that seems especially timely during these pandemic times. It also attacks her for standing against School Choice which is being promoted by Frank Edelblut NH's version of Betsy DeVos a move that would drain funds from NH public schools and possibly put our tax dollars into supporting religious schools. It's difficult to imagine that Erin Hennessey is unaware of the tone of her campaign and has no say in its direction. ""I approve this message"" used to follow campaign ads and if candidates don't approve the message and the means then are we voting for a candidate or the powers that control them? Sue Ford's campaign by comparison has been clean thankfully. She runs on her record of having been an elected Representative to Concord for the North Country and it's quite a commendable record. She worked hard in that role and voted in ways that supported the people of the North Country. It is telling that the New Hampshire Republican Party is targeting her so lavishly. They are clearly threatened by her candidacy in this race. The unfortunate component however is that instead of promoting Erin Hennessey they are attacking Sue Ford. Isn't this exactly the sort of campaign that is exhausting and demoralizing us? And can't they think of anything positive to say about Erin? Voting is the most important way that we can express ourselves in a democracy. It is the pivot point of the system. We vote for the candidate who we believe will do the best job. In voting we are not only supporting the candidate but also the means in which they are presented in their campaign and the tone of the campaign itself. A vote for a candidate is also a vote reinforcing the strategy and tone used. The question here is whether we want to validate and reward dirty politics and thus perpetuate them or whether we want to invest in a candidate who has proven herself to be worthy of our votes and has not stooped to new and demoralizing lows. It would seem like enough is enough when it comes to toxicity of attack politics and if we are ever going to move on we must invest our votes in a direction that promises growth and a return to civility. A vote for Sue Ford is a vote for just this and will also send the message to the Republican Party and its local candidate Erin Hennessey that we do not support dirty politics and that it is time to move on. In doing this we will have hit our low as a country and a region and can rediscover mutual respect and cooperation. Thank you Lucy Golden - Franconia",political,Facebook

When I decided to run for office I knew that I would be exposing my positions to challenges and ridicule but I have been amazed at the level of non-productive diatribe I have seen. I have been successful in finding attackers from both the left and right that have called me a liberal trump lover fence walker and senile conservative boomer all in the same week and its only Thursday. Who actually thinks these characterizations are productive? How can any of us who are unable to get someone else to empathize with us and see the prospective of a situation from our vantage point believe that this means the other person has a low IQ or is an idiot? Would it not be fair to assume part of the problem may be our inability to understand how they learn so we can get our point across? Wouldnt that mean we may be the one with the insufficient IQ? Why has it become so important to assign titles and characterizations to others of differing opinions rather than work to find sufficient middle ground to achieve a solution that is acceptable to all parties? I signed up for this target so its part of the entry fee.

Quite from the April 2020 article by Jeffrey Goldberg in the The Atlantic and from several very reliable sources:   Trump rejected the idea of the visit to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery bear Paris in 2018 because he feared his hair would become disheveled in the rain and because he did not believe it important to honor American war dead according to four people with firsthand knowledge of the discussion that day. In a conversation with senior staff members on the morning of the scheduled visit Trump said Why should I go to that cemetery? Its filled with losers. In a separate conversation on the same trip Trump referred to the more than 1800 marines who lost their lives at Belleau Wood as suckers for getting killed.,political,Facebook

Do not let the Guard Down or be overconfident!!Trump controls the Narrative in the USA. He can Tweet post on Facebook place Millions of dollars of messages throughout social media and reach close to 160 million people every day and if you add Fox News and as it happened in 2016 Russian promotions in favor of Trump the reach could amount to 200 million. If Trump with over 200000 deaths in the Country and counting millions unemployed thousands of small business in trouble says we are doing a good job even when he failed to provide the proper message and actions knowing how deadly the Virus is and he repeats it almost every day some people will buy into it and believe it...thats the power of Advertising. If Trump even when a number of States have used Mail-in voting for years without any problems other than North Carolina Republican candidate in 2018 and he says mail-in voting will be a fraud and he repeats it almost every day some people will buy-in and believe it. Thats the power of Advertising. If Trump accuses the candidate that beat the socialist candidate with the support of most Elected officials in House Senate and Democratic population of communist as scare tactic and considers himself the Law and Order candidate in the middle of riots violence under his watch because Trump can say anything he wants and he and the Russians can reach 200 million people. No Newspaper or Tv channels together can counter Trumps messages with Facts and Truth and reach 200 Million people every day. Add his nomination of a Supreme Court while people are voting for a President with the purpose of the repeal of Obama care and elimination of coverage of existing conditions and health care to millions of Americans and to Challenge Elections results even if the majority of the country votes to replace him. A wannabe tyrant Russias Putin Venezuelas Maduro style. But a Negligent Deceptive Divisive White Supremacist President cannot continue for 4 more years. Only we the people can overcome the power of Trump with our vote. Vote! Vote early by mail or in person but vote. We have more power than Trump.

"Virtual debates President Trump should refuse to have a ""virtual"" debate with Biden. It is a complete scam to cover up Biden's senility and other shortcomings.It is a plot by the corrupt democrats to hide Biden because he is not equipped to debate let alone be president.  The ""moderator "" if a debate takes place is totally partisan and prejudiced against The President. Remember these people are used to cheating and corruption and believe in knowing better than the people. For them ""the end justifies the means "" because they are a on a ""higher moral ground"" than the rest of us. After all we have had four more years of perfecting being the irredeemables and deplorables we already were in 2016. We are the racists sexists homophobes and xenophobic Americans of the country.

"John Durham I understand that the scope of your investigation has become much ""broader"".. However after such a long time if you already know of wrongdoing and fraud and corruption you should step forward and announce so. Maybe for the sake of the country and the people and for the sake of justice you should publish your investigation in two or more phases. To just take year after year in further probes is just not right. If you already know of foul play you must announce it ! Hillary Clinton created the Russian collusion hoax to take attention away from her cheating and stealing and being bribed in favor of her foundation for tens of millions of dollars. The monies paid were not for brilliant Bill Clinton speeches we all know that. She created this hoax to distract from her illegal email fiasco and emails that most probably proved she was being bribed and was selling favors for money to her and Bill.The bribes were indirectly going to the Clintons through direct contributions to ""The Clinton Foundation"".  It is quite comfortable and easy to extort other countries for money when you are The Secretary of State of The United States of America and you are willing to sell your country and people for personal gain and power. Biden did it as VP too !  Durham Mueller knew very early on in his investigation of ""Trump Russian Collusion"" that The President was innocent but dragged it on for years to beat Trump down with a circus of democrats and the MSM cheering him on. I feel with you the opposite is true. You know of extreme wrongdoing but you are holding back in laying the truth out. If there is no wrongdoing say so if that is the case. That is fine too whatever the truth is. Your reasoning that it has to be ""complete and comprehensive and it is broader"" just do not make any sense. ""Justice delayed is justice denied"" John Durham. Present your findings in two or more phases if need be but present them ! Stop the delays and show the country the truth. You have reasons to be fearful because the corruption goes very high up and the people know that but you have them on your side and on the side of the truth. You need their protection and you have it.  You and Attorney General Barr need to come out soon.

"The Sign in the Yard  The lady in the house across the street from me put back up the Trump/Pence sign in her yard. From this I'm inclined to make the following inferences... do you agree?   She is spitting in my face... and in the face of my father who served in the US Army during WW II in the fight against fascism and who has now been characterized as a ""loser and sucker"" by her candidate of choice.   She is telling me clearly and unequivocally that she supports both fascism and racism.  * She is revealing that she supports the outright treasonous conduct that we have all witnessed against the interests of the people of the United States in deference to the interests of Russia and other foreign adversaries.  * She is showing acceptance and support for the malfeasance and incompetence that has resulted in the needless death of a majority of the 215000+ who have died from the pandemic... along with the associated recession unemployment surge and destruction of businesses facilitated by the ongoing indifference and lack of competent action from this administration.  * She is disclosing that she has either been unable to recognize that someone with access to and control of our nuclear codes has blatantly repeatedly and publicly engaged in abusive and malignantly psychopathic behaviors and mental health disorders over a period of years... or that she does recognize it but she is just fine with it.  * She is indicating that she embraces running our government with a degree of corruption lawlessness and grossly unethical tactics analogous to that typical of a mafia operation; or that she is grossly unaware of what is going on in America today; or that she is living in an ""alternative reality"" divorced from the empirical world.  * She is signaling that she doesn't give a damn about the severe ramifications to our climate that our children will inherit or about the obscenely rising national debt that places a devastating burden upon future generations.  I dont know how to ever have respect for this person ever again. I respect her right to have opinions that are different than mine and to express them. But good people dont support this madness and good people wont vote to continue it. There is no way I can have personal respect for someone who has a belief system virtually identical to that of those who supported what happened in Europe in the 1930s and 1940s and that led to my relatives of generations past being sent to the gas chambers.  I have never had a chance to speak with her beyond a brief hello that we have sometimes exchanged when I jog by her house or go pick up my mail from the mailbox. But now I can't help but see her as a monster. And all she had to for that to happen was to put up that disgusting sign in her yard.",political,Facebook

"A CONSPIRACY THEORY D This is part of a series I have been writing on the subject there is much more I am still writing and will post some links in the comments Democrat or Republican we all need to open our our eyes.  Let's try this again. I am afraid to say what is in mind  not really afraid to say it but I fear where we are and where we are going and the future unless we stop and come to our senses quick looks scary.  We have an old tradition in this countrywhen we want to bring freedom and democracy to a foreign land we do one of two things we invade the country topple the regime and find some sellouts to replace the local government or we send arms to some disgruntled faction or two or three to start a civil war let their people destroy the country and we help whoever is the biggest traitor that will sell out the country to us.  The fact is that in a civil war there are no winning sides whoever comes up on top ( a civil war can last generations even) has to make a deal with an outsider or some super rich entity (ies) to maintain power and to establish controls. The super rich are not affected by the war itself in most inst6they may just go outside the war area ( even overseas) and come back later to assume power or control rebuilding effort and thus profit. In modern times the foriegn investment is stopped jobs and industries are lost poverty and misery spreads in all directions and for all sides.  If an entity or a power wanted to destroy the United States of course starting a civil war here would be the best way to destroy the nation its power and economy also. Let us assume that their is a ""cabal"" that is bent on destroying the country and taking control to destroy democracy and and set up autocratic regime todaybwould a good day since we are ready and willing to do it to ourselves. And how convenient if that power was to control parts of the government and the political apparatus already.  The two sides in the country today left and the right are willing to do it the right apparently thinks they have more guns so they will have the upper hand as most of the police and much of the military has already been brainwashed by their side and will be willing to kill for their purpose. They have been convinced that they are on the right side of history and they are sure to win the power. Of course the powers that be  the ones that are aiming to destroy democracy and and ruin the country have already a leader in place to do their bidding to call his followers to arms and to do the dirty work of encouraging civil strife.  More to follow  M. N. R.  12 OCTOBER 2020  CRISIS  An incident or an occasion that causes and brings about a lasting change in a person or even a society. That change once again depends upon the knowledge and the reasoning ability of the person or the society as a whole. The reasoning ability here depends upon education and also upon upbringing nature and nurture as they say. The same instant that will cause one to get motivated and work hard and get an education or such to get ahead could cause another to rob a store join a gang become a hooker or even join a church.  M. N. R.  12 OCTOBER 2020  VICTIMS  Once one has reached majority and claims maturity all choices are deliberate and all consequences always predicted.  If a baby is molested or a child is abused they have no control over the situation but when a person of age abuses alcohol or drugs drives drunk robs or kills drops out of school and has babies they can't afford they are not victims they know what they are doing and should be held responsible.  M. N. R.  That the democracy and the country itself is facing ruin regardless of who wins on the 3rd of November while both sides bicker about the supreme court nomination or the COVID-19 crisis we have bigger issues that need immediate attention. But we have been deliberately mislead. The plan is being worked by both sides to keep the population occupied with trash. I had warned about the militia plans and the infiltration of police and the military. I have written about the BLM and their misguided focus on the police brutality only. If there is a conspiracy it is about keeping the population confused and at each other's throat instead of solving problems. I wrote back in February how COVID-19 will impact everything we know about life from work to education and food  no one is talking about the new realities not in a major way and the public still has no idea what the new world will look like in a couple of years.  While a low level civil war or at least unrest is a real possibility regardless of who wins #republican side is not even trying to promote calm and peace. We will all pay for it. If Trump wins and igive him an 80% chance his followers may go to ""weapons free"" anyway.  Is it the conspiracy of the elite to start a civil war and destroy the democracy and install an autocratic regime. If I were betting I'd say that this the plan. A conspiracy right in your face and you are a willing participant. Only you lose is by winning. I am by no means done here do come back there is a lot more to this  M. N.

Flies Lies and Rolling Eyes  What better description to sum up the Vice Presidential Debate? How incredibly telling that the fly on Pences head received more attention than the answers or lack thereof by the candidates albeit lacking the petulant child banter.  So what did we learn? Senator Harris defense mechanism is condescending and exaggerated tones and gestures. Had she the ability to control her emotions her arguments would have resonated better with her audience. Although I would imagine the younger constituents were sitting on their couches cheering her on as she let Pence have it. Ironically with as much talking as she did I didnt hear her say anything of substance. What are their plans for COVID that arent already being done? Are they going to pack the Supreme Court? Are they repealing all of Trumps tax breaks not just those making over 400k per year? These are serious question that deserved answers.  We learned that VP Pence can stay level headed even if the face of adversity. All kidding aside how many of us could have sat there with a fly on our head and not flinched or swatted at it? How many of us could have kept our voices even and resisted sarcastic responses to Kamala? He was long-winded and stone-faced but he provided substance to his answers or as much as one can with 2 uninterrupted minutes. We all know he is the good cop of this administration and even if he didnt answer all questions he was respectful to his opponent.  Finally we learned that even when (after months of hoping from the left) Trump contracts COVID-19 takes the experimental treatments and not only survives but maintains a relatively regular schedule it is still not enough. It is not enough to quell the irrational fears. It is not enough calm the sensationalized media. It is not enough.  The left has so much faith in their candidate they have already started a process to replace him once in office. Making faux good-faith attempts at passing a stimulus after months of silence. Compromising the integrity of the election with mail in ballots likes its open season. They have so much faith in the polls they are still creating distractions 3 weeks before the election.  This election is not just about character and charisma it is about the seed of our nation. Freedom. The Governor of California introduced guidelines for holiday get togethers at home. Why should he have any say in how we celebrate holidays in our homes? That is what socialism is. That is not what America is.

"I condemn terrorism of any kind! It doesn't matter the race or the religion of the terrorist. Unfortunately the Wolverine Watchman group of terrorists set up their training camp on the same dirt road as my grandma's house in the Luther area. It is hard to consider a group of men with the goal of kidnapping our governor and overthrowing our state government with groups of giggling cousins exploring the vast woods behind Grandma's house.  We would climb the rolling hills explore the woods and pick the wild flowers along the way (it was a long time ago we were kids). If we were doing the same thing in the months leading up to these despicable men's arrest would we have heard the guns as they relentlessly fired into the peace and tranquility of the only place on earth that could bring the same comfort as the words ""Grandma's House""?  Even more incomprehensible than the terrorists themselves is the idea that there are politicians including Donald Trump that aren't calling out these men for what they are. Referring to them as a militia gives a bad name to the militias. It saddens me that as I type this there are those who will see this as a negative in my efforts to win my election.

As in Waco Tribune-Herald on 10 Oct 2020...  LISTEN TO THE WOMEN  by Gallagher & Schleicher  Six months ago we took a self-imposed sabbatical from the editorial pages of the Waco Tribune-Herald having no idea just how much weirder things could get in these somewhat United States.  Back then the novel coronavirus had taken only some 100000 American lives we were blissfully unaware of the Proud Boys and one might still imagine that surely there was some year when the president-to-be actually paid his fair share of personal income taxes into the system he longed to manage. And it was not yet known how deeply the presidents callousness might run when it came to the safety of everyone from those in the armed forces to his personal White House staff to the governor of Michigan.  The events during our six-month absence best are described as worst case scenario. Even Nostradamus could not have predicted a Rose Garden event to push through a post-election-start Supreme Court nominee that would turn into a super-spreader event. Our hope that we might return to the Trib to find less divisive times turned out to be no more realistic than expecting the coronavirus to magically disappear as if by a miracle. (Though perhaps our goal of not costing the Trib any additional subscribers or advertisers was fulfilled as the peculiar level of animosity our columns often generated subsided.)  The one positive thing we can say about this election is how much it does to the old adage that all the candidates are the same and voting makes no real difference. No modern president has ever been so universally embraced by white supremacists or been so timid in his willingness to condemn them. Democratic Joe Biden by contrast accepts the word of the FBI director and other national security officials that our greatest terrorism danger comes from these homegrown extremists  the ones urged by Trump to stand back and stand by the ones urged by Trump to Liberate Michigan.  The Trump-centered chaos of the last four years turns out not to be an accident. If one is an authoritarian narcissist being the star and potential savior of each days new crisis is a plus. During the primaries wed worried Biden was a bit dull and too moderate compared to some of the other candidates. But the publics exhaustion with Trump as well as Trumps inability to successfully tag Biden as a far-left hazard to liberty now persuade us that Joe may be just what is needed to give critical swing-state voters an alternative theyll accept.  We observe a number of younger white liberal males who still ponder whether to vote Green Party or sit this election out. They worry Biden is not liberal enough that crooks on Wall Street will never be called to account and that the most needy will remain the least protected. We ask them to be true to their progressive roots by joining us in listening to the women in their lives. By not assuming that their own ability to survive four more years of Trump makes it worthwhile to recklessly gamble his re-election might somehow cause a true liberal to be elected in 2024 to clean up the mess.  A recent Fox News poll showed Biden to be leading Trump nationally by 10 points but the gender gap in women versus men supporting Biden to be +19 points. Whether in other national polls or ones from battleground states the trend is a strongly consistent one.  Does Trump tend to remind women of that guy at work who wont let them speak in meetings? Of an abusive ex-husband? Of the arrogant boss who is never slowed by his ignorance? Of the frat boy in college who didnt believe that no meant no? All of the above?  Instead we surmise they simply see more clearly than the men in their lives how the safety and economic health of them and their families is too precarious to await a more perfect candidate while others use this election as an excuse to take part in testosterone-poisoned displays of AK-47s and Trump flags.  The overwhelming rejection of Trump/Pence by many women is no surprise in a state like Texas that has produced some of the sharpest minds and clearest hearts in public service. Ann Richards Barbara Jordan Molly Ivins Barbara Bush  the list goes on but all reflect the unflinching wisdom and wit of the Texas woman.  Women in Texas and elsewhere are able to see and accept what many men simply cannot: the fundamental importance of integrity empathy and humanity in those chosen to lead our country. We are in awe of those women who speak courageously and earnestly in their support for Biden/Harris or their opposition to Trump/Pence often putting them at odds with others at the office in church or on social media. We admire the determination of many others quietly planning to vote their own conscience and allowing a spouse or brother to make mistaken assumptions about what that decision might be.  For voters still on the fence know that in this election a vote for anyone other than Biden/Harris is a vote for Trump. Trump openly admits he doesnt necessarily plan to leave office even come 2024. By then he will have so packed the courts that even a President AOC could make no meaningful headway on issues such as climate change or universal health care. Male voters considering holding out for something better four years from now will do best to set aside their privilege and listen to those who will suffer most and be protected least if we continue down the present road. Listen to the women in your lives.  _____  David Gallagher is a transplanted Texan living and working in London and tweeting at @TBoneGallagher.

"AN AMERICAN NATIONALIST VOTING INDEX Draining the Swamp  ""Behind the ostensible government sits enthroned an invisible government owing no allegiance and acknowledging no responsibility to the people. To destroy this invisible government to befoul the unholy alliance between corrupt business and corrupt politics is the first task of the statesmanship of the day."" Theodore Roosevelt  This is a part of a series examining the issues in the presidential election. To see other articles in the series visit the website below and click on the 2020 Elections link on the Home page.  Score  Biden 0 Trump -1  Trumps victory in 2016 was powered by a call to drain the swamp in Washington which never consisted simply of campaign reform. It sought to end the kind of cancer described by Roosevelt  the control of government by a privileged few that subverts the very nature of democracy itself. We also now know it means different things to different groups. In this campaign the call for reform has focused on not just campaign reform but also on federal administrative and policing changes.  Campaign Finance Reform  The Citizens United decision and our loophole-riddle campaign finance laws have loosed a flood of money whose origins are opaque and very probably illegal. Democrats introduced a bill that would plug some of those loopholes. It attempts to limit the impact of Citizens United by requiring disclosure of donations of more than $10000 from certain non-profits that were previously exempt. It cracks down on digital ad spending on social media platforms by requiring the same kind of disclosure of the source of ads required for television and radio commercials. The bill also attempts to limit the use of social media for the kind of election interference we saw from the Russians in 2016 by banning campaign contributions from corporations with significant foreign ownership. Finally it also prevents foreign individuals from purchasing social media ads. Former Vice President Biden has endorsed these proposals and President Trump opposes them. This earns Biden a +1 and Trump a -1.  However there is a sleeper issue in campaign finance that has been ignored by both candidates. If you are like me your e-mail box has been deluged by appeals for campaign contributions from any number of candidates and partisan political action committees. They seek contributions of as little as five dollars by simple completion of a form on the Internet and a charge via PayPal or by credit card. While the identity of the donors must be disclosed there are no rules requiring the verification of their identities. A former Kansas attorney general recently issued an analysis of the contributions to the ActBlue independent committees which raised over $900 million for Democratic candidates. It showed how ActBlue has gamed the campaign finance system so that the true sources of their contributions is almost impossible to determine. This makes it easy for large donors to break up their contributions or foreign donors to hide theirs If Biden or President Trump are really interested in controlling dark money this loophole must be plugged as well.  Federal Administrative Law Reform  The failure of Congress to address a pressing issue has now become an excuse for forcing action through administrative rulemakings. As I mentioned in my post on the US Supreme Courts s opinion on the DACA rulemaking current law makes it difficult to control an executive agencys impulse to fill this perceived gap. This essentially creates a fourth branch of government whose inner workings are known and accessible to only a few.  Federal executive power needs to be reined in through new legislation that (1) Limits agency rulemaking to discrete subjects narrowly delegated to the agency; (2) Prohibit agency action if its impact on the economy or the number of people affected exceeds certain thresholds; (3) Allows more opportunity to challenge a agency ruling and repeal it. The DACA and Clean Power Plan rules of the Obama Administration show that Vice President Biden is a likely opponent of such reforms. Meanwhile Trump has relied on and touted his executive order power instead of pursuing legislation to prevent a future president from abusing these powers. President Bidens implied approval of current agency power results in a -1 for him on this issue while Trump deserves only a 0.  Law Enforcement Reform  The death of George Floyd and other African-Americans at the hands of the police and the FBI abuses of the FISA warrant system revealed in the Russia investigation has highlighted another swamp that needs to be drained  the excessive and unchecked power of law enforcement. As mentioned in this post policing reforms must be based not only reducing qualified immunity and other changes in tactics but also a top-to-bottom review of our law enforcement strategy.  Former Vice President Biden supports proposals to reform police tactics but never mentions the need for increased funding for the police necessary to do their job of maintaining order in our communities. The Obama Administrations acquiescence at the least and encouragement at worst of the FBIs FISA abuses does not inspire any confidence that he would support reform in this area. These two positions cancel each other out and earn him a zero on this subject. While the Trump Administration is vigorously pursuing the FBI abuses via the John Durham investigation the President has ignored and at times demagogued the police brutality issue Again the two positions cancel each other out and thus he also deserves only a zero  Conclusion  It is truly discouraging that neither candidate has Roosevelts level of concern about the perilous state of American democracy and civil rights. Trumps failures are particularly galling since his 2016 campaign featured the issue. It is up to American nationalists to press these issues with congressional candidates and in future elections.

From 2000 to 2007 under George Bush 491000 Americans died from the flu or pneumonia. From 2008 to 2015 under Barack Obama 393000 Americans died from the flu or pneumonia. Both are respiratory illnesses with basically the same symptoms. The major difference is pneumonia can be caused by bacteria or fungus as well. Masks can help prevent the spread of both illnesses. There are vaccines that can reduce the chances of getting both illnesses. Socially distancing is also effective.  President Trump and the task force have encouraged social distancing and masks for everyone and quarantine for those that are ill. PPE and ventilators have been manufactured and distributed at a record pace. Multiple vaccines and even some therapeutics are set to be ready in record time. Plans to distribute the vaccines rapidly using the U.S. Military have been made. The President is now working to make Regeneron the drug he was given available for emergency use to all Covid patients throughout the nation at no cost. The most vulnerable will have the opportunity to receive a vaccine first.  You might say that you wanted to see President Trump wear masks more often. You might say he shouldn't have rallies. You might find a hundred reasons he hasn't handled the virus the way you think he should have. You'll probably say the point I'm about to make doesn't count because Covid-19 is more contagious and kills more people. But I would argue that 61000 people dying each year over an 8 year period is an incredible number of lives.  So from 2000 to 2015 884000 Americans died from the flu or pneumonia under the leadership of George Bush and Barack Obama. Neither of them came close to the response that Trump has made against Covid-19. There were no warnings to social distance wear masks or quarantine. In fact there were no warnings at all from President Bush or President Obama. There was also a stint with the swine flue that Obama did little to address. Thankfully we all got lucky with that one.  Is it because fewer were dying from these illnesses each year than from a virus like Covid-19? Was losing 61000 lives each year to these two illnesses just an acceptable number? You can be certain that it wouldn't be if Trump was the President. Understand the deaths from Covid-19 are terrible but the blame doesn't fall on President Trump. If it does then the blame for the 884000 deaths from the flu or pneumonia between 2000 and 2015 falls on Presidents Bush and Obama.,political,Facebook

When a question is asked of the president cricket sounds should be played. Everyone has heard the old saying""One is what One consumes"". Apparently ""One is what One grabs"". Does anyone find it ironic Trump claims to be for Law and Order but he cannot follow rules and loves to create chaos.",political,Facebook
It IS possible to be a faithful Latter-day Saint and still vote FOR Joe Biden not just against Donald Trump. Joe is a deeply religious man committed to decency and respect and is running as he says to restore the soul of our nation. I have known him for many years and I believe he's the best equipped to do just that. He has the empathy necessary to help our country heal after an unrelenting stream of national crises. He has the humility to rely on experts. You can rest assured that when you vote for Joe you vote for a good man who will do his best to serve the American peoplesomething I don't think anyone can say about his opponent.  The Deseret News published an article with more faithful perspectives on this issue. I linked it in a comment below:,political,Facebook

Donald Trump is no longer just a person. He has become an idea a beacon of hope for true American patriots. He is the William Wallace of Freedom the beginning of real change in politics. He is not the last Trump we will see. My friends it is high time to wake up from our slumber and shake the core of all politicians who try to rule us and strip away our freedoms that so many brave Americans have fought and died for. Everyone of us must individually fight for not only our freedom but for the continual freedom for the very country we live in.

"""She puts others before herself. And it's not just me. It's her entire community. When the floods hit she was nonstop helping her constituents in any way she could. I swear she doesn't sleep.""  -- Rep. Karen Whitsett D-Detroit speaking of Rep. Annette Glenn R-Midland ___________________________________  MIRS NEWS Michigan Information & Research Service The State Capitol Lansing September 28 2020  Whitsett Cuts Radio Ad For Glenn  Rep. Karen WHITSETT (D-Detroit) is appearing in a radio ad for Rep. Annette GLENN (R-Midland) in the potentially competitive 98th House District.  Whitsett who disappointed rank-and-file Democrats earlier this year for her support of President Donald TRUMP's promotion of the COVID-19 drug hydroxychloroquine endorsed Glenn for ensuring she received the proper medical care when she tested positive for COVID-19.  ""Annette Glenn should be your choice"" Whitsett said in the ad.  To MIRS Whitsett described Glenn as her ""work sister."" When she got sick this past spring Glenn and her friends in the Democratic caucus  Reps. Sherry GAY-DAGNOGO (D-Detroit) LaTanya GARRETT (D-Detroit) Tenisha YANCEY (D-Detroit) and Yousef RABHI (D-Ann Arbor)  checked up on her to make sure she was taken care of.  Whitsett who has battled Lyme Disease feared for her life at a certain point and credited hydroxychloroquine for helping her pull through.  Meanwhile when cleaning supplies and toilet paper became a near impossibility to obtain in Detroit during the height of the Coronavirus this spring Glenn personally drove down from Midland to help Whitsett with supplies.  ""She puts others before herself"" Whitsett said. ""And it's not just me. It's her entire community. When the floods hit she was nonstop helping her constituents in any way she could.

Donald Trump has promised to eliminate the payroll tax if he's reelected.

My campaign has just submitted my completed questionnaire to the Chicago Sun-Times. Im sharing my responses below:  Thomas J Wilda Running for the 5th Congressional District seat in Illinois Green Party Social Worker PhD Facebook/Twitter/Instagram: @TomWilda2020 1 . Are you satisfied with the federal governments response to the COVID-19 pandemic? Why or why not? What grade would you give President Donald Trump for his handling of the pandemic and why? This pandemic was not taken seriously from the beginning. The failed response began before the pandemic hit with the reduction and near elimination of the CDC staff. Lack of equipment can be blamed on poor management and years of depending on labor camps in China to produce the equipment. President Trump failed to enact the Production Defense Act failed to abide by CDC guidelines failed to give help to the states in following CDC guidelines. We are left with the worse response to his crisis in the world the most cases the most deaths. Our country gets an F for our response. 2. What should the federal government do to stimulate economic recovery from the pandemic shutdowns? There is an immediate need for a UBI (Universal Basic Income) for every adult citizen in the country. $3000 a month is needed. For those that do not need it it can be taxed back. People need to pay rents and mortgages. Businesses that were doing well before the pandemic need to have payroll and expense support so that they will be viable after the pandemic. Medicare for all must be enacted to ensure medical coverage for citizens and payments to hospitals medical facilities and doctors. 3. In the wake of the death of George Floyd President Trump signed an executive order on police reform. It calls for the creation of a database to track police officers with multiple instances of misconduct federal grants to encourage police departments to meet higher certification standards on use of force and the greater involvement of social workers and mental health professionals when the police respond to calls dealing with homelessness mental illness and addiction. The order also calls for police departments to ban the use of chokeholds except when an officer feels his or her life is endangered. Will this be enough to address concerns about police brutality? If not what other steps should be taken? These reforms are not enough. President Trump (and it occurred with President Obama also) proudly gave assault military equipment to police departments. Police departments have developed a culture of military presence with a siege mentality. This process has been many years in the making. Police departments should be defunded and then refunded. Police officers can reapply for their position. All new police officers will be required to train in non-violent processes. Military equipment must be returned to the federal government. Police officers must be licensed with a requirement of continuing education in order to maintain their license. Civilian police boards must be enacted with the power to review suspend and terminate officers. 4. Also in the wake of the death of George Floyd the House passed the Justice in Policing Act which would ban police departments from using chokeholds develop a national standard for use of force limit the transfer of military weapons to police departments define lynching as a federal hate crime establish a national police misconduct registry and limit qualified immunity which protects officers from lawsuits over alleged misconduct. Do you support this legislation? Why or why not? What other steps if any would you like to see the federal government take on police reform? I do support this legislation. Please see my prior response for what other steps are needed for reform. 5. Whats your view on President Trumps decision to commute the sentence of Roger Stone? There are many people in prison for long sentences for possessing a very small amount of marijuana. It is not right that those that commit white collar crimes are treated better than other citizens. The president needs to commute the sentences of many people who have committed small crimes. 6. Please tell us about your civic work in the last two years whether its legislation you have sponsored or other paid or volunteer work to improve your community. The last years I have had a private practice in psychotherapy. Many of my clients have an inability to pay due to immigration status and other reasons. I have treated a good number of people pro bono. In past years I have worked with the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless; helped establish a homeless center and worked with various community groups. I am also a founding member of the Alliance for Just Money. 7. What are your views on the decision by the U.S. House to impeach President Donald Trump? Was the impeachment process fair or not? How so? If in your view the president should not have been impeached would you have supported censure? Please explain. The Democrats attempted to impeach the President on false premises. Evidence used was not genuine. The Steele dossier was a made-up document. The process was an attempt to avoid addressing the flaws in the Democratic platform as well as the support of a flawed candidate in a corrupt primary process. There are many things the President may be criminally liable for but these were not investigated. I think mostly because many politicians of both major parties are guilty of similar offenses. The process of impeachment was a sham and removed our attention from the wars we are in the out of control military budget the climate crisis and much more. 8. How would you reduce the federal budget deficit which now stands at about $1 trillion for 2020? What changes if any to the U.S. tax code do you support and why?  Firstly the budget deficit this year will be $3-4 trillion. It is this deficit that is often used as the reason we cannot have good things like Medicare for All forgiveness of student debt and free education. The deficit exists because the country relies on private banks purchasing Treasury Bonds for its money supply. There are few banks that are qualified to do this so the process is in the hands of a small number of people. In buying Treasury Bonds banks fund the government. They buy the bonds with money made from thin air but expect the money to be repaid with interest. So we have debt. When the government cannot cover its costs through taxation they sell more bonds. This process was established by The Federal Reserve system in 1913. All banks must be part of it. As part of this act private banks can create money from nothing for other purposes such as mortgages and student loans. Banks create money only through the establishment of debt. This debt under the current system can never be paid back. It does not have to be this way. Article 1 section 8 clause 5 of the US Constitution gives the federal government the right to create money without debt. My proposal would be to eliminate the Federal Reserve and the right of banks to create money with debt and create a monetary authority under the Department of the Treasury. The authority would determine the amount of money needed in the economy to provide for the common welfare and common needs. The Treasury would establish this amount and it would be budgeted by Congress. This would be clean money without debt. What about the debt that exists? It would be paid back to the banks by the Treasury over a period of years. Probably around 100. Banks would have money for their reserves and to lend for new investments and business ventures Regarding the tax code: All should be paying their fair share. The wealthiest have the first access to created money the average citizen has the last access. The last pay the most and the first pay the least. We need to change that so that the first are last and the last are first. That would be a fair tax system. 9. What changes would you like to see made to our nations healthcare system? Would you shore up the Affordable Care Act or work to repeal it in full? Whats your view on Medicare for All? And what should be done if anything to bring down the cost of prescription drugs? This is so easy. Medicare at 100% for all is the least expensive and most fair way to fund a healthcare system. Look at the rest of the developed world. The government through Medicare for all would be able to negotiate the price of drugs but medications would be paid for by a Medicare for all program. 10. Do you support or oppose DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) and why? Should a path to citizenship be created for the so-called DREAMers? Please explain. This is just simple justice. Those who came here as children and have grown up here and contribute to society have a right to stay. Anything else would be inhuman. Of course they should be able to become citizens. 11. What are the three most important issues in your district on which the federal government can and should act? In terms of the Federal Government for this district and many districts UBI with fair tax system is needed Medicare for all and a just distribution of federal dollars for human needs in the district. 12.  What is the biggest difference between you and your opponent(s)? I really dont know where my Republican opponent stands on these issues. As far as my Democratic opponent and the incumbent well I would say look at his voting record. 13. What action should Congress take if any to reduce gun violence? Military grade weaponry needs to be illegal. Other guns must be registered and owning a gun most be licensed with a requirement of yearly continuing education on gun safety. Police should be as focused on illegal gun sales as they are on drug sales. 14. Is climate change real? Is it significantly man-made? Is it a threat to humankind? What if anything should Congress and the federal government do about it? The knowledge that burning fossil fuels creates climate change was researched and confirmed by the oil companies themselves in the 1950s 70 years ago. It is not a debate in the scientific community; only the business community wants there to be a debate. We already see the effects of climate change and it will get worse. What is needed is a Green New Deal. We need to get off fossil fuels reduce consumption of energy and create jobs to protect water forests and animals our ecosystem both micro and macro. 15. What should Congress do to ensure the solvency of Social Security and Medicare? During the Reagan administration the Social Security fund was used to balance the budget. This money was taken from Social Security to make an economic policy appear better. There have been raids on Social Security ever since. There is no crisis of Social Security. Social Security is not part of the budget so cutting it would not make a difference in the deficit. The effort to reduce Social Security is totally inhumane. Social Security will be solvent if the money owed to it is paid. I am for Medicare for all. 16. What should Congress do to address the student loan crisis? Would you use the word crisis? Student debt is a crisis. It puts many from the younger generations in the position of being indentured servants. They are not able to participate fully in the economy because so much of their income goes to debt payment. Student loans should be assumed by the Federal Government and added to the deficit that will be paid overtime when we have a just clean money system. Yes this is a crisis for those who are burdened with this debt but this is also a crisis for the economy as money that pays back debt is not money that goes into the development of the economy. 17. What should our nations relationship be with Russia? We should have fair and just relationships with all nations. We should not have a belligerent oppositional relationship with any country. It is not in the interests of the American people to have such relationships only the interests of the military industrial complex. 18. Whats your view on the use of tariffs in international commerce? Has President Trump imposed tariffs properly and effectively? Please explain. President Trump uses tariffs as punishments. The industrialists have been sending jobs to places without worker protection and in the case of China to foreign labor camps for awhile. Once there is a truly fair workplace in every country there would be little need for tariff protection. We should be ensuring that workers are treated fairly both here and everywhere else and that ecological protections are in place everywhere. Once we have accomplished this tariffs will take care of themselves. 19. Does the United States have a responsibility to promote democracy in other countries? Please explain. We need to have democracy in the United States first. We know that our intelligence agencies have been undermining democracy in the rest of the world. This is not in service of the American people but in the interests of big business. We should not send military anywhere with the excuse that we are doing it to protect democracy. We are in other countries to secure wealth for the richest. 20. What should Congress do to limit the proliferation of nuclear arms? Demand that the President negotiate a nuclear arms reduction treaty with all nuclear powers with the end goal of eliminating all nuclear arms. 21. Please list all relatives on public or campaign payrolls and their jobs on those payrolls. None 22. What historical figure from Illinois other than Abraham Lincoln (because everybodys big on Abe) do you most admire or draw inspiration from? Please explain. I was inspired by Paul Simons moral and principled stances on issues. 23. Whats your favorite TV streaming or web-based show of all time. Why? I do not watch much TV but 20 years ago my wife and I liked the X Files. The portrayal of the intersection of science and intuition was interesting.,political,Facebook
"INTO THE ABYSS 118 A  I am a man without a master I am not obligated to anyone I am free I was born free.  I have some commitments I have a few obligations I have some loyalties I have some morals and few boundaries of character. My choice all of my own choosing.  I was asked to run for a small public office but I am not politically affiliated and my freedom is not for sale neither is my soul. You can not today run for an office without obligating yourself to a few people with money for whom you will have to return favors for their support you can only do that if you sell your soul.  Freedom can not be purchased but you have to pay a price to be free. I have more people that ""hate my guts"" but they will also vouch for my character. They will hate me and still say that I am a good guy I don't mind I can still be courteous and sociable and they know.  Life is a game after all some of us can play it better than others the idea of gambling is that you win a little more than fifty percent of the time that is all you need to do.  But we get lost not that we are innocent but that we don't know ourselves who we are what we are capable of what we really know. A blind person will follow a one eyed man who can not read the map but will still tell you he is going to his destination. Just don't ask him how.  And this explains much of our love life our relationships and even our politics.  So what about our politics? We are proud Americans we love our country we love our freedoms we love our # Flag we love our #Constitution  how can there be any doubt. We fly our flag we don't like people that burn our flag we love our freedom and we love our country.  But I digress whether you are a lefty or a righty conservative or liberal Republican or a Democrat your actions and your words do not match what you say you are how you really feel  you are just full of it a lost soul without guidance or purpose you are a useful idiot mentally and psychologically immature you have no idea even how you really feel.  M. N. R.  27 SEPTEMBER 2020  I have never been guilty of being politically correct one plays the game only if he wants to I have literally lived under "" moral police "" also so no. Should one have boundaries absolutely but that comes from maturity and maturity comes from ""true knowledge and reason""  not a dogma.  ( M. N. R.)  It is about money and power the politics is it has always been so. We have been asleep at the wheel. Being entertained to death. No one wants to work hard no one wants to struggle we have become like a stray dog or cat you feed them once and they are yours to use and abuse as you wish. M. N. R.  This not even a partisian issue it is a self inflicted wound we keep electing the same crooked douchebags. Term limits ban the lobbyists finance the campaigns with public funds. Require the politicians as to how they got rich even after leaving the office.  M.. N. R  IF YOU HAVE BEEN IGNORANT FOR TOO LONG YOU BECOME AFRAID OF LEARNING SOMETHING NEW AND HAVING TO CHANGE YOUR POINT OF VIEW  (M. N. R.)  INTO THE ABYSS 118 B  Time flies and I lose track of time I like to sleep but I also like to stay up late my days are busy seven days a week I have things to get done I have responsibilities I don't work hard or do any menial work anymore I do work though. I also like to read I like to learn I hate TV any kind of TV I watch segments of various programs on various channels. We should know why the TV has programming it is for programming your mind no matter what you are watching sitcom news commentary you are programmed according to your choice.  So I watched the debate or what was called a debate. Mind you I worked in War Planning I took part in high level discussions debating merits of plans making deals writing letters of agreement managing airspace and deconfliction airspace. I helped set mission priorities I know how to discuss things how to make deals how to prioritize how to give and how to take. The mission of the two candidates was to bring their programs and their messages to the American people not to their parties and their believers. Were I at the head of the table where this debate was conducted I would have called in the MPs and had the two arrested. For insubordination and for wasting my time.  How can a country progress where the ""one nation"" is willing to tear itself apart and have winners and losers on the same team. How do we move forward? You can't even have mule team or a team of dogs where one half is pulling one way the other half in the opposite direction.  If there is a ""Conspiracy theory "" then I have one it is time cause the population to split the country to self destruct and the rich to escape without having to answer for the crime of looting the country and selling us into slavery.  In his Dictionary of Received Ideas Gustav Flaubert explained Idiots ""Anyone that thinks differently than you"" and this our state of mind today even after 110 years nothing has changed.  The conspiracy is not that the Children are lost it has happened through out human history it will still happen tomorrow they are also found they always have been human trafficking tragic as it is also has happened and still is happening the task force credited lately for discovering such children has been in the headlines lately only because the subject made headlines the task force was established and has been finding children since 2015.  It has become our culture we watch sitcoms and laugh about the cruelty that is hidden there in we joke about prisoners being tortured the killings captured on videos are the big joke for the partisans why should one be surprised that #Trump would joke about the disabled that we are willing to take away food from the hungry healthcare from the needy that we are okay with kids in cages. Don't look at others look at what we have become a society of vultures. We don't even take care of our kids raising them with love and respect or teaching them about a moral and ethical living. We subject our children to abuse putting our personal ""freedoms"" and ""desires"" above their welfare and needs. How do you think these will grow up how will they learn to respect their elders their parents and even themselves.  M. N. R. 02 OCTOBER 2020",political,Facebook

Is it possible to gaslight the entire country?  What do you get when you cross an insatiable desire for power raging hatred of anyone opposed to your agenda and a monumental lack of self-awareness? You get the modern democrat (Keystone Cop) party and their endless list of failed gaslighting and disinformation operations. Gaslighting and disinformation operations are similar in that both are used to create a false narrative. They differ in that gaslighting is an attempt to make us believe something completely different from the facts that we know and see to be true. Disinformation operations put out false information that we dont know to be false at the time. The Russia collusion hoax was a classical disinformation campaign as were the Kavanaugh hearings and the impeachment hearings of President Trump.  For those of you who dont know the term gaslight came about because of a movie by the same name released way back in 1944. The movie is about a husband who is trying to make his wife think she is going insane by telling her that things she thought were happening were not and that things she thought were not happening indeed were. This brings us to the current gaslighting projects by the democrats.  We are completely surrounded like fish in water by their gaslighting projects with the news media politicians and talking heads being the primary provocateurs. Take for instance the rioting and destruction that the democrats have encouraged promoted and funded. They have taken to going in front of any camera and making the claim that President Trump is the cause of the rioting. Now there is video evidence of President Trump offering any support needed to stop the violence in its tracks. Unfortunately many democrat controlled cities have refused his offer because they want to allow their cities to devolve into utter chaos. The democrats trying to blame President is like telling us that the Sun rises in the North and sets in the South. It is clear that democrat operatives are causing and perpetrating the violence and destruction including the assassination of police officers.  The latest gaslight operation to bring Trump down is the accusation that he publicly downplayed the dangers of the KungFluenza as he privately talked about how serious it was. One of the first responsibilities of a leader is to not instill panic so his comments were measured and responsible in that regard. The first responsibility of the democrats is to instill as much panic as possible so that the American people will willingly surrender as much freedom as possible to the democrats. Trumps comments measured as they were werent much different than those of health officials including Anthony Fauci that we heard with our own ears.  Now what did we see from President Trump? We saw him be the first world leader to ban travel from China and then from Europe and other hot spots. He mobilized the private sector to make available needed medical equipment that irresponsible state officials neglected to do. He held a daily briefing for the American people to stay informed about the progression of the disease and the progress on getting needed medical supplies and standing up mobile hospitals. While he was trying to instill calm his actions showed that he took the virus very seriously.  One of the funniest gaslighting operations to watch are the talking head panels on the left wing Propaganda Ministry networks. You should know that democrats use these panels for purposes of the appeal to authority. Viewers are expected to see the panelists as knowledgeable and wise and therefore are expected believe everything the panelists say. As each one makes assertions about Trump and America that we know to be lies the others are sitting there nodding their heads in agreement. The nods are supposed to impart to the viewers that what they are hearing is the consensus of the anointed. And after one of them says something spectacularly stupid that we are supposed to believe and there is that brief silence until another picks up the conversation I keep getting the sense that a punch line is coming just like at the end of any good joke.  We could go on and on here with different examples but I think you get the point. The problem the democrats have is that they are stuck in the past while living in an era of modern technology in the form of social media playback and satellites that can send information around the world the moment it happens. Leftist gaslighting operations cant overpower that. We can see for ourselves in real time who is doing what to whom and who is supporting it. We know which party is supporting the violence in our streets and which party is opposed to it. We know which party supports destroying the economy and which party supports strengthening it. Lastly we know which party believes in America and which party hates America. The age old communist and Nazi tactic of repeating a lie over and over until it becomes the truth simply no longer works.,political,Facebook
Ginsburg's replacement should be approved before the election  Just imagine what the election will be like if this nomination is left hanging until after the election. The upcoming election is certain to be a nightmare that will make Bush/Gore in 2000 look like walk in the park and thats without confirming Trumps nominee no matter who she is. I hate to think what it would be like with the Ginsburg seat still open. Imagine the voter fraud the thousands of ballots that show up out of nowhere found in someones trunk. As we have seen there are no limits to democrat abuses of power abuses of freedom and abuses to the electoral system. If that seat remains open there will be nothing the democrats wont do in order to win the election. Mitch McConnell must do whatever needs to be done to get Trumps nominee confirmed.  Currently there are two women who appear to be the front-runners Amy Coney Barrett and Barbara Lagoa both Catholics. It matters not which one is selected either will be relentlessly attacked over her religion. Since the democrats cant accuse either of rape or train rapes they will try to discredit the nominee by tying her to comments said by others in her church. She will be said to be unworthy because of such associations. The nominee should not be subjected to the endless attacks on her religion especially since the Constitution states that there will be no religious tests for government office. Therefore the Senate should forgo the judiciary committee hearing if rules allow take it to the full Senate and get this thing done.,political,Facebook
NIMROD and the 2020 ELECTION You are askingwhat does Nimrod have to do with our upcoming election? Lets take a look at Nimrodhe was the first of the mighty men to appear on earth after the Flood (Genesis 10:8-12). He established a great kingdom which included the city of Babeland oh yesthe Tower of Babel (Genesis 11:1-9). The Tower occurred in the time frame of 2242 B.C. Nimrod was the designer of an ancient power structure and the founder of a false religion. He wanted to become God so he attempted to build a tower to Heaven hoping to thwart the plans of God. Gods mighty power ended the tower construction and the people were settled in other parts of the world.  Nimrod birthed a new religion called globalism that is very active today and still spreading. Here is a partial list of Nimrods spiritual heirs: Illuminati including the Rothschilds and Rockefellers; Clinton organization; Soros; Saul Alinsky; United Nations; Pope Francis and the Global Public Authority; IMF; The World Bank; International Criminal Court; Obama shadow government; Club of Rome; Druids; Free Masons; Bohemian Grove; Yale University Skull and Bones; Satanic Club; Order of Assassins; Bilderberg Group; and the Council of Foreign Relations.  Lets talk about America. God is in control of all that happens in this world. Psalm 75:7 states It is God who judges nations. He brings one down and exalts another. God has allowed America to become a great nation founded on Judeo-Christian principles. But He has a warningHe will bless each nation with a span of time so it might prosper and do well but this blessing ends when a nation becomes degenerate rebellious and unfit to rule.  Our nation was founded in 1776we are 244 years old now! We have an experiment called a representative democracy or a constitutional republic and I believe we are close to losing that experiment.  What has happened to our country in the past sixty some years? America has become completely demoralized desensitized and deceived. For our democracy and republic to work requires the legislative leaders and citizens to be spiritually mature. Your guessdo we have that situation now? And what about the morals of our country? Morals can only be built on the basis of a true moral sourceand that is God. Not following Gods morals will lead to anarchyare we seeing that today? It appears that we have rejected objective moral values in favor of political correctness. Serious questionare we self destructing from within?  I believe we are a post Christian nation. Why? A list of Supreme Court rulings provides the answer. America has crossed over every Biblical boundary!  1962: Removal of prayer in public schools.  1963: Removal of Bible reading in public schools.  1973: Legalized abortions.  1980: Ten Commandments not allowed in public schools.  2003: Struck down sodomy law.  2013: Struck down Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA).  2015: Ruled in favor of same sex marriages.  In addition to the above what are some of the hot issues going on in our country now.  Covid-19 pandemic: A real issue but blown out of proportion and politicized. Churches are non-essential while abortion clinics are essential.  The wall illegals ICE and sanctuary cities.  A national debt of $22 trillion with $100 trillion of unfunded liabilities.  Black Lives Matter White Lives Matter Blue Lives Matter (police). Dont forget all lives matter in Gods sight.  LGBTQ issues.  Abortion euthanasia and the selling of aborted baby parts.  Global warming hoax starring Al Gore.  Epstein/Maxwell and human trafficking.  Defund/dismantle police forces.  The Squad Islam BDS of Israel.  You add to this list please.  Now let me show you how close we are to a full blown socialist state which will lead to a communist state. I mentioned Saul Alinsky abovehe wrote a book called Rules for Radicals. Hillary Clinton did her college thesis on his writings and Obama writes about him in his books. Alinsky expounds there are eight levels of control before you can create a socialist state. Check these out and tell me how we are doing.  1. Healthcare: Control healthcare and you control the people. My responsewe are almost there with a one-payer system called socialized medicine. 2. Poverty: Increase the poverty level as high as possible. Poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live. My responsewe are there now. 3. Debt: Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. My responsewe are there now. 4. Gun control: Take guns away and remove ability to defend oneself. That way you are able to create a police state. My responseenough Americans are armed now and this will not happen in the immediate future. 5. Welfare: Take control of every aspect of their lives. My responsethis is happening as we speak. 6. Education: Take control of what people read and listen to. Take control of what children learn in schools. The saying goesget the children and you have the future. My responsewe are there now. 7. Religion: Remove the belief in God from the government and schools. My responsewe are there now. 8. Class warfare: Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent and it will be easier to tax the wealthy to support the poor. My responsewe are there now.  Not a pretty picture is it!  We are on a fast track to a New World Order which includes a one world government currency and religion. The world has turned to secular humanism and that is the successor to Christianity. It began with the Humanist Manifesto in 1933 then revised in 1973. The theory of evolution replaced Gods six days of creation. Science is now worshiped as mans only hope and science denies Gods creation.  What about our churches? The Bible tells us that in the end times churches will sink into apostasy and worldliness. It is happening! Church influence is weakening or gone. Jesus is not being preached from the pulpit. Name one church today in which the pastor calls abortion a sin from the pulpit. Another pointno true born again believer can support murdering babies. If you believe in the one true God and His Bible then you have to be concerned.  All of the above to get to the 2020 election! Our country is in a big mess. The upcoming November election is the most important one in history when it comes to the future of our country. We are in a struggle for our national soul.  A quick review of the 2016 election. Trump announced his candidacy in June 2015 and then won the election with a 304-227 electoral college victory over Hillary Clinton. Against all oddsTrump showed up! My opinionTrump is not perfect by any means. He was born a sinner just like you and me. But it is obvious that God is using him in many ways as our President. I only wish that Trump be more careful and selective in his language that goes out over the internet the airwaves and print.  What has happened since? The veil of immorality greed corruption and deceit has been torn open. No President has ever faced what Trump has in his first four year term.  Here are just a few:  The Swamp including both Democrats and Republicans.  The never Trumpers (Romney Flake Ryan Bush family and others).  The Dems and mass media being one.  Deep State found in all agencies.  FBI corruption (Comey McCabe Mueller).  The Clintons and their foundation.  Attorney General & Justice Department (Lynch Holder Rosenstein.)  CIA & National Intelligence (Clapper & Brennan).  Obamas Organizing for Action (OFA) shadow government (2 miles from White House). The Organization is a democratic activist group to fight Trumps every move.  Mueller investigation.  FISA abuses.  Illegal immigration issuesthe wall.  Tax returns.  Covid-19 pandemic.  Russian probe.  Impeachment (Schumer Pelosi Nadler Schiff).  Nationalism versus globalism.  Soros threatened to take down Trump to fulfill NWO plans for financial Armageddon.  We know that if Hillary had won all the lies cover-ups and wrong doings done by Obama and Hillary would have been buried. Now they are being uncovered gradually. We are waiting on the Durham report.  The hatred of Trump can only be understood as demonically driven and thus galvanizing the division of our nation. We see that most of the Washington bureaucrats are people of depraved hearts and minds no longer knowing right from wrong.  We need Trump four more years to continue his work in saving maintaining and improving our republic and democracy.  What if Trump loses and the Democrats take the White House the Senate and keep the House. God forbid! If that happens the spiritual heirs of Nimrod win big. I predict we will have a full blown socialist government within eight years.  I do believe that God in His mercy is giving us just a little time as a country to repent. I believe that God has given us plenty of warnings and is beginning His judgment on our country. My opinion is that America will not recoverwe are too far gonewe are beyond the point of returnthere will be no national repentance.  I pray that I am wrong. Please speak up America and vote your heart in November.,political,Facebook

Hypocritical much?  You know I spent many years avoiding politics on social media because well who really wants to be voluntarily attacked? Thats the problem with todays society opposing views are condemned instead of just understanding their path in life was different and thats what lead to their ideals. I saw a comment the other day that a liberal didnt like talking to her conservative friends anymore...well same because conservatives are labeled has callous and racist somehow? Fun fact a republican president ended slavery...  This the the hypocrisy that I have issues with liberals about:  1. You condemn Trump for his alleged affairs but Clinton admitted to having an affair in the Oval Office.  2. You call Melania weak and a puppet for staying with Trump but you put Hillary on pedestal for her resilience and strong nature for staying with Bill.  3. You spent two years trying to prove Russia interfered with the election and that we need stricter enforcements but want mail in voting. (Because obviously that is the most efficient way to make sure every vote is counted AND that it is not fraudulent).  4. Raising minimum wage does not put America first or create more jobs...increasing minimum wage increases the most expensive part of COGS already so it makes the increase moot AND makes American manufacturers have to produce overseas to be competitive in the market. (In case you dont understand that it closes American factories losing jobs not gaining).  5. You condemn Trump for not doing enough to stop the pandemic but called him racist when he closed the travel borders to slow the spread. Your solution to the problem is passing a bill but you refuse to negotiate a reasonable bill before the election because it will boost the economy and Trumps re-election.  6. You blame Trump for the current stimulus bill that is stalled but Congress is the one with more power and they went on vacation. You also condemned him for forcing the EDD benefits and forcing the states to take some responsibility...and why shouldnt they the states are shutting down the economy not the federal government. -Also any individuals accepting the additional $300 that curses Trumps name when he is the only reason you are getting something additional...your leaders would rather do nothing than at least pass legislation that does have consensus you should ask them why!  7. Biden calling this Trumps Recession when the reality of the recession is from California being shutdown not something Trump did. California is the 5th largest economy in the WORLD all of its own if you dont understand that is the largest thing hindering our economy right now you didnt pay attention in high school.  8. His tax returns...quite frankly I could care less. Every single American does everything they can to pay the least amount of taxes possible so why this is so important to Democratics is beyond me. You know one of the reasons Biden pays so much in taxes? His lack of charitable contributions...and Trump is donating his entire Presidential salary to charity so go figure.  Another fun fact: Trump was nominated twice for the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize for the recent Israeli-UAE-Bahrain peace talks.  My point is not to deter you from your beliefs it is to say that neither side is perfect. Trump is an average American in terms of his speaking but whether you want to admit it or not hes a pretty good businessman. It took a pandemic and world shutdown to stop the economic growth we were experiencing in the US. The only reason we have not recovered as much as we should is the continued shutdown of California and a few other states. COVID is real the sensationalism and fear is not but history has shown that when the economy is good an incumbent President is 100% re-elected. So the hate that dems have for Trump is greater than the health and stability of our nation thats not American.  Disclaimer: I do not agree with everything that Trump says but I in no way wish for his failure because we all fail when that happens no matter who is that office.  May God Bless our Country over the next few weeks as more hate and negativity is spread during these elections.  ,political,Facebook

"Chris Wallace and other demented socialist democrat hypocrites.Weren't you complaining that The President had not condemned white supremacists and their ""hate"" even though he has condemned them repeatedly and strongly multiple times before your stupid debate questioning of him on the subject ? Have you seen the hate filled wishes and comments of your despicable kind against The President and The First Lady. ? These sick people are wishing the death of The First Couple. What about you you POS Anderson Cooper and Don Lemon and Rachel Maddow ? are you charlatans going to condemn these leftists ?  I am disgusted by Pelosi Adam Schittf Jerry Nadler Maxine Waters and Chuck Schumer and the Clintons and many more democRats but I still do not wish for their death . I dislike Cuomo and De Blasio and Newsom too and do not hide it but I still do not wish them to die by a disease or a sickness that is deadly.  We all die it is inevitable but to wish the death of The President and his wife no matter how much you dislike them is purely sick and demented.Nothing is below th dignity of the new democRat party and its followers.Just nothing !

"From 2001 to 2009 Trump was a democrat. He became a republican in 2009. I think that he has seen both sides and knows the difference. One thing he knows for sure and does when necessary is fight the democrats like democrats. He is not like most of the rest of the spineless republicans who have still not figured it out that the democrats fight dirty and hard with no holds barred ! When the democrats "" fight their opponentsanything goes and nothing is disallowed or off limits. Identity politics name calling smearing demonizing propaganda misinformation changing positions multiple times double standards lying cheating and changing rules are just some of the methods democrats have used for decades. The fake news MSM sides with them and enables them in their methods. President Trump figured this out almost immediately and knew he had to fight back hard to preserve his presidency. The democrats controlling only one branch of government with a slight majority have had the republicans on the defensive for almost four years. The only real fighter against them has been The president. The democrats had false Russian collusion obstruction of justice phony quid pro quo bribery impeachment and much more and still have not been able to beat President Trump. God bless him he is a fighter for the country and The American People ! It is high time that all the republicans back the president and fight the democrats the way they fight their ""opponents"". The Senate Republicans have the power to help The President because they are in a majority and have the power to vote impeachment and numerous other powers. What else has to happen on top of all that I have described above for Republicans to not only fight back but to take the offensive for a change ! The democrats run circles around the always defensive nice guysrepublicans. Now include rioting burning looting and total violence against innocent citizens and total anarchy all by liberals and fascists encouraged by democrat mayors  governors and democrat politicians in all positions ? Vote by mail is another fraud being committed by democrats against the country ! Wake up Republican politicians It is time to fight fire with fire and help the country survive from four years of agony and distress. The ""good people"" need and deserve help.Decades of ""Kafka trapping"" has disabled you and you need to wake up from your stupor. You republicans and we Trump supporters hold the moral ground because the democrats have lost all morality and that too should encourage you ! The democrat MSM lies and makes fake news 24/7.  Start by immediately approving The ""lady Justice"" The President has appointed. He has every right to appoint her and you have every right to vote her in right away without allowing the typical gamesmanship and delays the democrats play !",political,Facebook

Texans and Floridians have the ability to save our country from horrible strife. Donald Trump is setting the stage to put into question the results of the election with court fights over mail in ballots in battleground states. This will almost certainly cause massive demonstrations. Right wing groups and militias are preparing to take to the streets with weapons to counter the demonstrations. Some of these groups like the Oath Keepers are former military and active duty law enforcement. If Trump loses Texas and Florida at the ballot box with in-person voting he will have no legal recourse but to relinquish power. If you are a voter on the fence you must exercise your right to vote. If at all possible do this in person. With early voting starting soon you should be able to vote with little line or inconvenience. If you are a Republican and not an adherent of the racist groups like Proud Boys and Bugaloos then you should see the damage this man has done to your party. It is time you took your party back by getting rid of this scourge. I understand that it would be extremely difficult to vote for a Democrat for president but the country can survive a four year democratic presidency much better than the Republican party can survive with this man as its leader. Go ahead and vote for your party's candidates for congress and the Democrats won't be able to get much done. The future of your party and our country depends on you doing the right thing.,political,Facebook

Warning this is a sarcastic post about Mitch McConnell.  I am seeing political ads by Mitch McConnell that are nonstop attack ads on Amy McGrath and her Liberal ideas without any ads proudly touting his policies.  Here is my idea for an attack ad that Mitch McConnell could run against Amy McGrath that would also demonstrate his commitment to Repealing and Replacing the Affordable Care Act/Obamacare:  ( The background pictures could show office doors being slammed shut in Kentucky as each topic is covered. They could be labeled: Protection Against Preexisting Conditions-Closed  PreNatal Care And Free Birth Control - Closed  Mental Health Counseling Access-Closed And Substance Abuse Counseling Access-Closed )  Amy McGrath supports Obamacare and wants to improve on it. She has flat out said it!  In contrast I Mitch McConnell  have enthusiastically led the fight to repeal Obamacare. I have been proudly working to end ACA/Obamacare since it passed in 2010. The bill to gut Obamacare was the Republican AHCA. The Republican American Health Care Act of 2017 or proudly called Trumpcare.  I voted for the AHCA to Gut Obamacare. Just after my vote to gut Obamacare the Congressional Budget Office issued its report saying 23 million Americans would lose healthcare coverage. That meant roughly 330000 Kentuckians. That bill would have succeeded in the Senate except for the Late Senator John McCain giving it the thumbs down. But lets review what this bill would have done to America.  I Mitch McConnell with that vote voted to remove protections against Preexisting Conditions that Obamacare enforced for all of us Americans.  I Mitch McConnell with that vote voted for the Insurance and Pharmaceutical Companies whose PACs donate huge amounts to my campaigns.  I Mitch McConnell with that vote voted to eliminate free birth control one of Obamacares 10 Basic Health Essentials and the very best way to prevent elective abortions by preventing unplanned pregnancies.  I Mitch McConnell with that vote voted to take Away control over their bodies from many Middle Class Working Poor And Marginalized girls and women who cant afford birth control. I Mitch McConnell did that with full knowledge of that impact. The side effect to my vote would be for more girls and women to seek abortions because I voted to take away free birth control.  I Mitch McConnell with that vote that would have eliminated the 10 Basic Health Essentials voted to reduce programs against the Opioid Epidemic. That vote by eliminating 10 Basic Health Essentials would have eliminated access to mental health and substance abuse counseling. Meaning that I Mitch McConnell with that vote voted to increase Opioid Addiction by taking away the tools to fight it.  I Mitch McConnell approve this message because by Repealing ACA/Obamacare I was glad to kick 23 million people off Healthcare including 330000 Kentuckians. And we all know because Amy McGrath is Too Liberal for Kentucky she will keep Obamacare and improve it!  (Closing picture shows all Doors closing at once.)  Full disclosure I Chuck Eddy Lifelong Moderate Republican proudly support Democrat Amy McGrath because Trumpian Republican Mitch McConnell and his voting record are bad for Kentucky.  Aaaaaand how would you like to be without Healthcare during Covid19? Aaaaaand for all of you people that lost Healthcare when you lost your Employer Health Insurance dont forget that Mitch McConnell has his orporare Donor$ Back$ but not yours. Please vote accordingly.  P.S. Amy McGrath is a 20 year Marine Veteran. For the past 36 years Mitch McConnell has been a Veteran Of Corporate Donors Fundraiser Dinners.  P.P.S. Dont forget that Mitch McConnell was SILENT at the same time Donald Trump was ignoring lying and Downplaying the Covid19 Pandemic. Trumps and McConnells pitiful ineffective inadequate and very slow response to Covid19 has now infected over 7299080 Americans as of today including Donald and Melania Trump.

WHY RUN GREEN INDEPENDENT? I aim to assist in a transformation of American democracy to deconstruct the power structures of our two major parties and to promote the imperative of environmental stewardship as the foremost medium for economic growth and public health. The two parties that have reigned our government for centuries are not equipped to respond to socio-economic needs in a timely enough manner to make a difference when it counts. How long can we wait? More than $20 million dollars revenue annually could be realized by investing in offshore wind energy that could be sold to other northeast states. A Katahdin North Woods National Park would inject more than $100 million of recreation dollars into Maine. Ultimately no one party should ever have a majority of government representation because there is no one party that truly represents a majority of citizens. This democratic system is antique and outdated but the two are often the only choices we have. In House District 135 voters can break the cycle. Voting for me will not get Biden or Trump elected but it will signal to both Democrats and Republicans that an ecologically-focused perspective needs to be responded to with governmental action.

My thoughts and prayers as well as those of #TeamMikula go out to President Trump and the First Lady who both just tested positive for COVID-19. I hope they both remain asymptomatic and quickly recover.  We must continue to remain vigilant of COVID-19 and continue to practice common sense safety precautions - such as hand washing social distancing (when possible) and mask usage (where appropriate); however we must also follow the lead of President Trump and continue on normally with our lives as much as possible with the realization that this virus is likely to be around for the foreseeable future and we cannot keep ourselves and our communities locked down forever.  As with most things in life we are able to compromise between two extremes - in this case not just ignoring the virus but also not living in total fear of it and allowing it to disrupt our way of life indefinitely.  #TeamMikula #HistoryOfService,political,Facebook
"UPDATED: 205000+ Americans dead a majority of them an unnecessary consequence of incompetence and deliberate malfeasance. An utter failure to protect America -- he couldn't even be bothered to wear a mask to protect himself. A federal government defined by corruption on a scale well beyond anything witnessed in our lifetimes. The treasonous betrayal of American interests to Russia. A man with the nuclear codes suffering from severe psychiatric disorders. Massive job losses coupled with the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. Those who have served America in uniform characterized as losers and suckers. A Senate and President that sprints in a mad rush to fill a Supreme Court seat with someone who will likely act to take health insurance from millions and stand against justice and equality for decades but that cant muster the effort to deal with COVID-19 and a recession relief package for month upon month.  We are closer than we have ever been in our lifetimes to losing American democracy likely for the rest of our lives. The end could be less than two months away.  My voice alone may be small. Your voice alone may be small. But together we can change the present and summon a better future. If you dont like what is happening then DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. WE are NOT POWERLESS.  What can you do? 1) VOTE and encourage everyone you can to do so as well; 2) PROTEST (peacefully and safely); and 3) CONTRIBUTE resources to the candidates that represent American values.  There is one Presidential race and 35 Senate races up for election this November 3. Nineteen of the 35 Senate races are currently considered ""up for grabs."" For each of these races I've listed the contenders along with links to the donation and web site for the Democratic nominee. The Domino Principle is not affiliated with any political party. However the current situation is one in which there is not a single Republican candidate that has in the past or for which there is any indication that they will in the future stand up in support of equality the rule of law sanity and basic democratic principles. So here we are.  For President: Joe Biden (D) vs. Donald Trump (R-Incumbent)    The following four Senate races are considered a toss-up at the current time:  Iowa: Theresa Greenfield (D) vs. Joni Ernst (R-Incumbent)    Maine: Sarah Gideon (D) vs. Susan Collins (R-Incumbent)    Montana: Steve Bullock (D) vs. Steve Daines (R-Incumbent)    North Carolina: Cal Cunningham (D) vs. Thom Tillis (R-Incumbent)    The following nine Senate races are considered leaning Republican but are not considered safe:  Alaska: Dr. Al Gross (Independent with support from Democratic party) vs. Dan Sullivan (R-Incumbent)    Alabama: Doug Jones (D-Incumbent) vs. Tommy Tuberville (R)    Georgia: Reverend Raphael Warnock (D) vs. Kelly Loeffler (R-Incumbent)    Georgia: Jon Ossoff (D) vs. David Perdue (R-Incumbent)    Kansas: Barbara Bollier (D) vs. Roger Marshall (R)    Kentucky: Amy McGrath (D) vs. Mitch McConnell (R-Incumbent)    Mississippi: Mike Espy (D) vs. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Incumbent)    South Carolina: Jaime Harrison (D) vs. Lindsey Graham (R-Incumbent)    Texas: MJ Hegar (D) vs. John Cornyn (R-Incumbent)    The following six Senate races are considered leaning Democratic but are not considered safe:  Arizona: Mark Kelly (D) vs. Martha McSally (R-Incumbent)    Colorado: John Hickenlooper (D) vs Cory Gardner (R-Incumbent)    Michigan: Gary Peters (D-Incumbent) vs. John James    Minnesota: Tina Smith (D-Incumbent) vs. Jason Lewis (R)    New Hampshire: Jeanne Shaheen (D-Incumbent) vs. Bryant ""Corky"" Messner (R)    New Mexico: Ben Ray Lujn (D) vs. Mark Ronchetti (R)    Each of the above D candidates stands against what is happening in America today and needs our help.

A president who has lied over and over to the country from Mexico paying for a Wall denying bribing Ukraine telling the people the Coronavirus was a Hoax while knowing the deadly dangers we were facing and with over 200000 deaths most in the world millions unemployed thousand of small business lost still considers himself he has done a good job. A president that has evaded taxes payments paying only $750 for the last two years and not paying any for years while getting 80 Million refund from IRS and now that is in dispute due to his efforts to use loopholes and most likely fraudulent records. And still refuses to release his tax returns to show the truth if different. A president that has no empathy for social justice for War heroes and no solutions to the chaos and violence we are living in and promoter of hate division and White Supremacy. There no need for Debate. The only thing we need is to vote in overwhelming fashion to send Trump to Retirement to Mar a Lago. so he can live making payments on his 300 Million debt.

Alguien que es millonario puede no pagar taxes por 10 de los 18 y en dos de los aos solo $750.00?? si estas pensando que eso es imposibleTE EQUIVOCAS...Donald Trump el ""exitoso empresario"" no solo no pago impuestos durante tantos aos sino que lo hizo declarando cientos de millones en perdidas...ahora se puede entender claramente por que este farzante no presento publicamente sus taxes cosa a la que se ha negado durante los 4 aos desde su fatidica nominacion a la Presidencia y la eventual lamentable toma de pocesion. El New York Times fue el que destapo la olla y claro ahora Republicanos dicen tal cual dijo Trump que eso es noticia falsa. JA JA JA si es noticia falsa Sr. Presidente y Republicanos; es bien facil: TRUMP MUESTRA TODOS SUS IMCOME TAXES Y PRUEBA QUE EL NEW YORK TIMES ESTA MINTIENDO Y DE PASO LES METE UNA DEMANDA QUE SE QUEDA CON TODA ESA EMPRESA. Una y otra vez se demuestra lo farzante mentiroso arrogante y descarado que es Donald Trump y como se entiende que personas puedan seguir creyendo en este payaso?? Como los cubanos apoyan a alguien que los convencio en las elecciones anteriores que iba a sacar a la dictadura y despues de 4 aos esta sigue ahi??? y ahora a pocos dias de las elecciones pone nuevas sanciones. No se dan cuenta que lo hace solo para ganar el voto de Uds??? POR QUE NO PUSO TODAS LAS SANCIONES POSIBLES EN LOS 4 AOS DE PRESIDENTE????

En 47 aos viviendo en este gran Pais Pais de democracia de respeto por la prensa respeto por las personas y la justicia llego este despreciable humano a tratar de cambiarlo todo diciendo que la prensa es falsa poniendole nombretes a politicos dandole de baja a todos los que se pusieron en contra de el a todos los boto.

Why Do They HATE The Cops???  It started about 30 years ago in our public-school system. They (the mostly liberal leaning bureaucracy of educators) changed the curriculum being taught to our young innocent impressionable minds. They taught them that our country was bad and rich people and those with a different opinion were racist. They stopped saying the Pledge of Allegiance. They removed the American Flag from many of the classrooms. They made them watch the Inauguration of the Clintons and the Obamas. They taught children that anyone of a different opinion was racist and the cops hated African Americans. They brainwashed a whole generation of our youngest most impressionable minds. They told them if they felt different that was only White Privilege and guilt setting in. They became part of the strongest union in the country i.e. The Teachers Union. Its not these young peoples fault that this is what they were taught in the schools we sent them to...You wonder why there arent more charter schools? Because the left wants these children taught their reality. But you can change this you see it all starts at home. Talk to your kids about R.E.S.P.E.C.T and freedom of speech and choice and our wonderful country. Tell them how lucky we are and how they want to take all of that away. Tell them that the police are there to help us and that they are good. And make sure you vote for Donald J. Trump for President so as to preserve our way of life and uphold the Constitution...  Talk to your children your nieces and nephews and all of those whom will listen.  Theyre worth it as is our way of life.  Love to know your thoughts.  Thanks  Kevin,political,Facebook

"It is just impossible for a democrat to be impartial as a moderator or journalist. The weasel of Fox Chris Wallace showed his true colors once again. The problem is that a democRat like Chris Wallace like all intolerant democRats lack a lobe of their brain.That is called the ""objectivity lobe"" of the brain. They just do not know how to be tolerant or impartial. This included Ruth Bader Ginsburg who was a SCOTUS justice and should have been impartial when she was not.That was the most important quality a judge needs but she lacked it. It is just a typical liberal democRat quality. All the MSM and all democRat pundits and handlers are the same. President Trump was called a clown tonight in the debates and was also told to shut up by the clown in chief Biden who has completely lost his faculties. I am sure he was given drugs to be able to debate The President. I am disappointed that The President did not tear him apart when he was called names by this fraud and thief. He should have told him to shut up much stronger and called him a retard when Biden called him a clown.Trump was too civil with a very uncivil low IQ idiot Biden. Chris Wallace was a disgrace. That was to be expected. Wallace asked The president to condemn white supremacists but could not name one such group. Trump has condemned them many times however Wallace never asked Biden if he was for law and order and against Antifa and BLM and the violence and anarchy in democRat cities. He should have asked Biden if he was for defunding the police too ! He was so prejudiced against The President which is typical of the weasel of Fox.",political,Facebook

Lets talk about mental health.  As many of you know mental health is a very important issue for me and my campaign but also for our country as a whole. Living in the mountains of Colorado the mental health crisis is at the forefront of our healthcare needs and we simply dont have the access available for everyone who would benefit from increased mental healthcare. This is something I have plans to change if I am elected to represent HD 57.  During the Presidential debates last night Donald Trump made a mockery of addiction and mental illness when he implied that Joe Bidens son Hunter who has struggled with both of these health problems which frequently go hand in hand was a lesser-than person or a bad person or a loser due to being in recovery. As a recovering alcoholic myself this was very upsetting to me.  This is not the kind of leadership our country needs while we battle increasingly high cases of addiction depression and anxiety. I believe Vice President Biden said the correct thing when he informed Donald Trump in front of our nation that yes his son has struggled but that he is in recovery and most importantly he is proud of him.  We need to focus on de-stigmatizing mental health problems and increase Colorados access to resources and support.,political,Facebook

Racism is cultivated and we have to pull it from the roots  You cant address racism in adults and think it will stop if we dont pull the racism out from the roots. Racism is cultivated and the roots take hold in childhood.  I spent my entire life save my time at Howard University receiving an education at a cost to my well-being. I want my children Adeline and Langston to receive an education without receiving the bigotry and racism that were a condition of mine.  My mother has always called me an idealist. She always says that I cant change the world. And I always respond to her I can try. I instill this directive into my children. I require them and teach them how to speak up for anyone being marginalized. I require them to not marginalize for any reason. I dont feel many of her peers are being taught the same thing at home. And to be clear not talking about it is just as detrimental. If you truly want our children to be their authentic selves then we have to provide an environment for that to happen. We have to nourish and cultivate that environment so our kids can grow into successful human beings.  We currently have a President of the United States who when asked if he denounces white supremacy cant just say Yes I unequivocally denounce it and it has no place in our country. He will not say it. Please understand Im not bringing this up to be political. Denouncing any kind of supremacy should not be a political stance. Im bringing it up because this is what many if not the majority feel about white supremacy. It is what they feel about systemic racism. Remember what I said earlier not talking about it is just as detrimental. They will not say they support it but they will not say they denounce it or they will not talk about it at all. I can say this because he won the presidency. Almost half the voters cast their ballot for someone with this ideology and it may happen again. This country voted for a man that said that he could just grab a womans vagina.  My point is this. If you voted for these ideals you are definitely complicit. But dont think because you didnt vote for these ideals that these ideals dont exist in your standard operating procedure. It is built into our society and history proves it to be so. Donald Trump is just a person but the ideology is systemic. Systemic racism systemic misogyny systemic gender and sexual inequality are all deeply rooted in our society. They are built in. To think a liberal person regardless of race has weeded out these ideals would be an unreasonable assertion. Weeds grow back if they are not consistently maintained.  Im asking everyone to pull the weeds. Im asking you to begin that process with our children. Im asking you to not make this a political problem. If you think racism doesnt affect you you are wrong because you see it is affecting you now. I am asking you to love our children.,political,Facebook
The first Presidential debate between has concluded. Who do you think won.. Joe Biden or Donald Trump?,political,Facebook
My take on the debate................ If you just came from Mars and knew no background you would probably say Trump won and is a better person to run country...... But when you look at it from the standpoint of what they were both trying to accomplish.... China Joe just needed to survive thru without making any major gaffs... a couple of small ones but everyone expects that from him and not get a complete gotcha point on any of his lies... even though he flat out lied a couple times including saying Hunter did not get 3.5 million from Moscow Mayors wife... that is proven... Trump wasnt able to drive home the point he was lying..... So overall  even though he did not say a thing of substance... I think China Joe is Happy with his performance. Trump has so much ammunition of this guy taking bribes not doing anything for the people being a racist having the worse policies and much more.... the guy should not be running..... but the main stream media never calls him out on anything  and they are his best ally.... So this is one of the few chances he had to enlighten the public on the truth and drive it home... bit in the short periods of time... the format him talking over Biden... and not just picking 1 or 2 Biden weaknesses to drive home...... he tried to hit all of China Joes weaknesses  and it would take a week long debate to cover them . So even fhough on a level basis Trump would get win.... In both of their goals Biden is Happy  Trump is not happy with outcome!,political,Facebook
"To democrat hypocrites who never address the 'issues ""of the country because they never have any new ideas and solutions for the welfare and advancement of the country. All they do is attack The President . They try to ""elevate"" themselves by putting President Trump down. Trump gives his whole Presidential salary to charity. Do any of you ? You all became richer after taking office but he was rich before taking office. You have major multibillionaires on your side who have not paid a dollar of taxes. Nor have their multibillion dollar companies. Amazon paid ZERO dollars in federal income tax on $11 billion in before tax PROFIT in 2018. Amazon paid an effective rate of 1.2% or $162 million on income of $13.3 billion last year. Jeff Bezos also bought a $165 million mansion in Beverly Hills which is more than the taxes he paid on $13.3 billion dollars of income ! He is the owner of the trash newspaper called The Washington Post or the propaganda newspaper of the socialist democrat left. Many billionaires have paid minimal income taxes or none at all. That is called ""accounting"" using write offs depreciations and other LEGAL methods. The New York Times which you can use if you ever run out of toilet paper again has ""cleverly"" come out saying President trump paid $750 in taxes. If trueAll the power to him because that is the tax code that Biden and Pelosi and Obama had in place for years. The timing and the source make me doubt the veracity of that claim. Another very poor ""hit job"" on Trump. The writers of this piece of crap in The New York Times must think they are so clever. It used to be such a great newspaper years ago and look at it now ! Propaganda lies misinformation unnamed sources and more lies. They lie so much that there is a disturbing trending increase relying on unnamed sources. By the way if you do use the paper for toilet paper make sure your behind does not get influenced too much or ""Brainwashed "" and rebel against you.

Please let your legislators know you support the passing of House Bill 3322 by signing and sharing the following petition: https://www.change.org/BeCompassionate2020  The legislation aligns closely with the federal bipartisan First Step Act signed into law by President Trump in December 2018. President Trump spoke at Benedict College in South Carolina where he expressed his passion for the new legislation. If the Federal Government and many other states support Sentencing Reform then SC should follow.  South Carolina is known for its antiquated views and statues. For example the US Congress passed the 19th Amendment in June 1919 allowing women to vote. On January 28 1920 South Carolina voted to reject the 19th Amendment while 36 other states ratified the Amendment. South Carolina did not officially ratify the Amendment until July 1 1969. 50 years later.  Now it's time to bring other statutes into the 21st century like Sentencing Reform.  The prison infrastructure cannot accommodate America's four-decade-long experiment of mass incarceration and overcriminalization is widely recognized as a failure. At an annual cost of more than $80-90 billion taxpayer dollars. The US incarcerates more people than any other country in the world. Statistics show people sentenced to unimaginably long sentences do little to advance justice and provide deterrence. The seven states with the highest incarceration rates are all in the South.  SCDC has proven its inability to provide fundamental human rights to inmates e.g. protection from physical and sexual abuse nutritional meals access to adequate mental and medical care and sanitary housing. The deterioration of the prison's infrastructure is disturbing and dangerous. Prison personnel brings in contraband inmates/employees assaulted and killed extreme staff shortages limited meals excessive lockdowns outdated/broken equipment are a few examples.  The State needs to find another way of running the correctional facilities. H3322 in its current draft or a modified version could partially or fully remedy some of the critical issues within SCDC.  Send geriatric and incapacitated inmates home to their families. They pose no threat to society. Secondly utilize home confinement for non-violent offenders. Thirdly release qualified inmates incarcerated for possession particularly those with marijuana charges. It's perverse to detain individuals for years for a drug that drives tax revenue in some states.  SC incarcerates 1300-1350 geriatric (over 60) and palliative care inmates costing taxpayers millions each year. Keeping infirmary patients serves no purpose when they are no threat to society. It costs 3-4 times more to house them and Medicaid is 3x less expensive. The continued incarceration of such prisoners is senseless and inhumane.  COs and medical staff share the facilities are so short-staffed in some instances there is one guard making rounds in the infirmary and one nurse on the floor trying to manage patients' well-being. Some infirm patients are fully or partially bedridden. They lay in their urine and feces for hours bathed when staff and time permits dependent on someone to give them a drink and feed them. Understaffing an infirmary could be dangerously negligent and reckless resulting in injuries and deaths.  A prison sentence that was just when imposed could become cruel and senseless if not altered because of changed circumstances. An inclusive and fair medical furlough program (Compassionate Release) is merciful. It recognizes the need for end-of-life dignity the financial and emotional distress placed on the inmates' families.  Albeit the primary focus is on fundamental human rights and rehabilitation programs for inmates. We would be remiss to overlook the fiduciary windfall should the State reduce incarceration for qualified offenders serving 65% of their sentences and the release of incapacitated inmates.  It's time for a change. Politicians should stop vote pandering on both sides of the aisle. It's an insult to constituents and it's a slap in the face to the inmates' families. The State has a solution and now they need to take action when it is most needed. If Legislators don't bring H3322 to the floor for an emergency vote constituents (republicans independents and democrats) will know the SC Executive Branch and Congress does not care how many inmates die.,political,Facebook

For what he has had to endure every day and what he's willing to endure now is absolutely reprehensible! And I would gladly lay my life down for him! Because he's doing it for us right now! How inspiring he is! I don't care what he's done we're all sinners and we have all fallen short of the glory of God! But what we're witnessing is one-man's finest hour! I toast to you President Trump! And I thank the Lord Jesus Christ for appointing you as our President of the United States of America.

One thought has recycled for months now. Often after a nights slumber I awake to the awareness that an enormous cloud is continuing to grow over the election. Is the election being tampered with if so then exactly how are they interfering and if they are who are the forces at work to destroy our democratic republic and can the election be an honest one? This conversation along with the following two subjects  Covid-19 and law and order  have become the most debated issues in the country from the everyday Joe and Sally to the endless chatter of pundits.  Well I have the answer. The sad truth is that the election is being tampered with  by us. We are buying in to the turmoil and confusion being delivered by our media our political parties and our foreign advisories in an endless information drop that happens every nano second. These information drops thunder into our homes cars and across our media devises like a virus of its own. Our foreign adversaries are exerting influence and if possible direct influence as often as possible as they have done for decades and decades. Today those plays on their parts are easier because of the new fertile ground for influence and meddling that the internet provides.  Our adversaries have always known that destabilization of our institutions will lead to the demise of our leading position in the world community. They have stated as much if we would only listen attentively. But this simple concept needs our complicity. Mistrust in our foundational processes is the fastest way to destroy the United States of America  are they succeeding? Ask yourself. We have processes lawful processes to deal with an injustice and the resulting frustration of fatigue with our foundational design. Taking the law into your own hands destroying property frightening and intimidating folks is not part of the law. In fact those are unlawful activities and there must be equal protection under the law in all applications of the law not just the ones that are cherry-picked. How are we doing on this? Ask yourself.  Today there appears to be little patience with lawful peaceful processes that have been a bedrock of our country. It is too slow and antiquated is the hue and cry by some organized entities that seek to tear down and rebuild the country. Rebuild to what design? Become a God-less nation with for example nuclear families a thing of the past and on and on. How are we doing? Ask yourself. This coming election we must not and I restate must not embrace the herd mentality and cast a vote based on sound bites that are designed to permeate your consciousness creating a feeling of comfort that you are doing the right thing.  Please I implore you do your homework before casting your vote in this election that is being billed as the only time we have ever had a leader who is unfit or a leader who possesses decency and on and on it goes. This is really about inclusion of all and decisions about the future of our country which will require a strong determined leader whomever receives our mandate. Here is an example of the outright manipulation we are being subjected to without any nuance and how it can be utilized by our foreign adversaries.  Let us look at the decency word used by the Lincoln Project to gaslight Republican voters that are uncomfortable with President Trumps behavior. Who are their founders? Mostly past political election consultants and operatives who were scooted aside with Trumps outsider win. They want to defeat the man who impacted their livelihoods and with whom they differ by referring to Senator Joe Bidens decency as their unique selling proposition to persuade you to vote for Biden. That is the juxtaposition against Lying Trump.  People lie but are some worse than others? Their message is Trump lies and Joe is decent  lets look. Dr. Jill Biden according to her ex-husband Bill Stevenson met Joe Biden when he and his ex-wife worked on Bidens first campaign for Senator in Delaware in 1972. He says they sat in Bidens kitchen working on the campaign. Jill Biden married this ex-football player now millionaire businessman at the age of eighteen. He says he became convinced of the affair when Joe Biden had a small fender-bender while driving Stevensons wifes (Jill) Corvette. At the time of their divorce they owned a bar and music venue in downtown Wilmington. Jill sued Stevenson for one half the value of the bar Stone Balloon but the judge in the case denied her petition.  Biden said during the nationally televised DNC convention he was introduced to Jill via a blind date in 1975 by his brother. Do your homework. If the ex-husband (named one of the most successful businessman in Delaware) is telling the truth (he says he has no ill will but facts are facts) then the would-be president lied to the nation on national television about fundamental facts of his life and that is not the only time.  He also told a shabby lie about his first wife and daughters death. When giving speeches he said that they were killed by a man (Mr. Dunn) who drank his lunch. Yet it appears that the then Mrs. Biden was unfortunately at fault. No evidence of alcohol on either driver. Dunns daughter had to finally write a cease and desist demand that Biden halt defaming her father. It stopped. Final note the official highway patrol record of the accident cannot be located to date.  More decency. China according to US intelligence reports appears to be urging the United States voters to favor Senator Biden. Bidens record on China is interesting. His son Hunter made a deal with financial institutions that are not independent entities but entities of the Communist Party and received remuneration for doing so. Senator Bidens brothers and sister are implicated in receiving financial benefit here in the US from consulting in-house advertising and real estate deals that Biden showed favor by even meeting potential investors along the way.  More decency. Where are the movements that led the cancel culture activities against so many men when Uncle Joe Biden has had charges launched against him that were never rigorously investigated? Do your homework.  Now President Trump and his decency. His niece portrayed him as a horribly flawed individual and his sister said that he could not be trusted. His last remaining brother who died recently appears to not have shared these feelings. His daughter received trademarks from China. His children and his staff were working on real estate deals in Russia and elsewhere when he was running for President. Russia is said to favor him.  His widely known unseemly exploits with women did not (at least to our knowledge to date) occur while in office. His pejorative characterization of women and what he could do to them  vetted more than most.  His relationship with Russia at least to date has not revealed any money taken from Russian oligarchs during his time in office and the investigations to date do not have concrete evidence that he or his family were financially rewarded during his run for the presidency or while in office.  These few facts might inspire you to move yourself out of the column of an uninformed or misinformed voter counted on by so many who need you to remain in that column. In closing do not take my word for anything you read. Do your homework and arrive at your own conclusion before voting if decency is your test. How are we doing with our choices to lead our nation? Maybe one day we will be able to meet in the middle once again.,political,Facebook

We will not invest in Starbucks (SBUX) and neither should you but you likely do in the mutual funds and ETFs you currently own.  Starbucks (SBUX) has for many years pursued a liberal corporate agenda in the belief that these actions bolster profits and make them good corporate citizens. Its effect on the bottom line is questionable Starbucks stocks total return has trailed the overall market as well as the restaurant sector for the last 5 years. [data as of 9/22/2020 calculated by Morningstar]. We do not believe that Starbucks is systemically important to a diversified portfolio and should be boycotted by politically conservative investors. Remember its anti-Christmas holiday campaign? In 2015 the coffee chain chose to feature seasonal holiday cups without any reference to Christmas or Christianity. This led then-candidate Donald Trump to denounce Starbucks War on Christmas during his 2016 presidential campaign. That same year Starbucks fell flat on its face with its #RaceTogether campaign which aimed to promote race-related conversations between customers and Starbucks employees. The corporation encouraged its employees to write the hashtag on cups like it does with customer names on the cups but the outcry led the corporation to end the campaign after a week. Starbucks has also promoted left-wing politics such as supporting gay marriage in 2012 and telling gun owners not to carry firearms into their stores in 2013. This year they banned employees from wearing clothing supporting Black Lives Matter only to reverse the policy after being pressured by left-wing activists and even supplying employees with BLM t-shirts. Starbucks pioneering left-wing corporate activism has encouraged other corporations to follow suit in the public square. Now it seems every major corporation is kowtowing to liberal and left-wing politics out of fear or as an act of pandering to potential customers and investors. Instead of remaining apolitical corporations have become political machines.  To learn more about our solutions for politically conservative Investors please visit our website,political,Facebook
When the tyrant is in Action. We have a response There are reasons why Trump is in a hurry to nominate a new justice to the Supreme Court. One is not to repeal the abortion law. In 2016 Republicans had full control of Congress and Executive and they didnt make an effort to repeal abortion they went for the repeal of Obamacare. Two weeks after the November election the Supreme Court will start deliberating the Republicans and DOJ law suit to dismantle Obamacare affecting millions of people and their existing conditions. To Repeal Obama Care even after losing the elections is the goal of Trump. He cannot stand anything that is named Obama. The other reason for the hurry is to protect himself from all investigations on his financials tax returns and most of all to protect himself from being Court Marshall for his Negligence and lies to the country instead of providing the proper message and actions for protections as was his responsibility as President at War. His downplaying of virus dangers and lies to the country has caused over 200 thousand deaths millions of unemployed and thousands of small businesses falling. Not acceptable for a President at War. The other reason is his preparation for a coup if he loses the elections. His deceptive message about mail-in voting when Florida is not the only state who has being voting by mail in the past in high percentages and his representation that the country is full of crooks trying to commit fraud. Instead of promoting safety and civil duty he pretends to add a Trump supporter to the Supreme Court to make sure the Court will go along with his plot Our Response and actions as a country must be to vote in mail-in early voting and on election day in overwhelming numbers. That will be our coup to recover our country and our democracy!! Lets send him to retirement. His punishment will arrive one day!! Lord! Save us from Trump!,political,Facebook

"Here we go again ! democrats can always disagree with Republicans and conservatives and those who oppose them but woe if you disagree with the democrats. If they like something they want to force you to like it and if they dislike something they want to force you to dislike it. In both cases they want to make what they want or don't want the law for everyone. They are not content enough to practice what they want or do not want. That freedom of choice is not satisfying enough for them ! They always want everybody else to be forced to do the same. I have never understood this sick mentality ! ""Herd mentality"" or ""sheep"" mentality ! freedom of speech is only for them hate in the name of freedom is for them violent protests are ""mostly peaceful"" for them unless it is directed against them. Then you are a racist or white supremcist. They hate Trump and that means YOU must hate Trump too. If not you are a xenophobe racist homophobe and the other goodies they like to falsely call people. If you are black but not a democrat you are an uncle Tom or not BLACK at all. You are not a woman to be protected or respected if you are not a liberal or democrat. You are not gay if you are a conservative. Now they want the rules changed like they always do when it does not fit the democrat narrative and agenda. The President should not nominate a new justice until after the elections. Justices have been selected for The Supreme Court 29 times in elections years. It is ok if they the democrats stack the courts with nominees of the presidents that are democrats such as Obama and Clinton but not if a republican president wants to ""stack"" the court with non revisionist non activist justices. He must not select someone who applies the law rather than make the law according to his or her wishes or maybe I should say to their extreme leftist vision and beliefs ! Socialist spoiled democrats Ruth Bader Ginsburg is DEAD ! She did not resign she DIED. Trump did not kill her ! He has every right to select a justice he likes and trusts conservative or not ! Respect the law of the land for once instead of complaining and threatening and protesting. !! Your socialist democrat leaders and some behind the scenes sinister manipulators of the deep state love the division and anarchy. Stop being fooled every time and falling into their traps. A president selects the Justice of SCOTUS and the electoral college selects The President whether you like it or not.We will not change the rules just because you yell and scream and threaten everyone or because you lose !

"These United States are at a crossroads and in the virtual crosshairs of history whether this nation survives to meet its aspirations is firmly in the minds hearts and ultimately in the hands of voters! DA 2020 (Share if you agree!)  My political leanings have been pulled right and left but reside in the middle. I see merit and peril on the left and on the right. I have experienced these leanings over a long period as such my remaining time to ponder to worry to rage to praise are nearing a conclusion and as a result will not greatly impact me nor my desires nor my limited needs.  But as I suspect you share I have great concern for the well being of my successors be they kin EACH of my fellow countrymen (regardless of party or political leanings) and for the nation's foundational principles.  But hear me I rendered to the nation an oath of service an oath that I have never relinquished nor ever shall I. This is my nation with warts moles and cancerous growths. Yet I love her.  I love her not merely for what she has accomplished good noble and enlightened but to what she aspires. I anguish with her for her shortcomings for her lack of integrity for her meanness for not meeting her aspirations.  I think that the path forward is ominous; there are so many daunting issues. I need not enumerate nor discuss them here. We all know them whether we acknowledge or deny the seriousness of their impacts. They are numerous and varied!  To me if there is to be hope and purpose of a fulfillment of ""Americanism"" in its numerous facets it must flow and flow with minimal blemish in this perilous time from a Zenith. If it cannot flow there from it cannot be hindered thereby.  That zenith is the ""Presidency of the United States of America"". That is to say neither man nor woman but presence and passion and gentle persuasion respect for the citizenry respect for lawful norms lawful and constitutional processes. Also their efforts for and their hopes for the health and economic welfare and beneficial freedoms of the populace evermore for us than for themselves.  Whether the nation continues and succeeds or falters and ultimately fails is not the choice of the President chosen but the choice of those that choose our next Zenith. That choice includes counting each lawfully cast ballot.  So please consider what merits and traits that person should possess. Should they follow constitutional norms and confront today's challenges in those contexts or should they seek political expediency and chart a new course despite our norms?  Answer carefully for are you a Liberal trying to Conserve or a Conservative trying to Liberalize even corrupt American governance? Will you Stay the Course or will you Stray the Course?  In the administration of this page a common allegation from supporters of Mr. Trump is that the nation is on the brink of becoming Socialist or in the same breath Communist.  Although they are not truly equivalent and many aspects of American society are socialistic in nature let's lump them together and consider them to be bad for the nation's future.  However lost in these allegations is an acknowledgement that Mr. Trump is acting in ways manners and purposes to stray from our embedded norms toward authoritarian totalitarian precepts and practices equivalent to Putin's Russia and Communism.  For example Mr. Trump has publicly stated that if he wins re-election that he will try to negotiate a third term ""because he deserves it.""  So let's say that he achieves such extraordinary things in a second term that a case could be made that he ""is [in fact] deserving""! So should he just seize power or should he seek to re-amend the U.S. Constitution to allow additional terms of office?  Neither! We must insist upon that as the vital the only option.  Clearly he is testing the waters in the current election not merely pondering a third or fourth term as Putin has assured to himself.  He is waging war against Vote by Mail despite it being in existence since Union soldiers voted by mail during the Civil War.  He claims that ballots are distributed to anyone with no control over them. That is one of his biggest lies; it simply is not true. Vote by Mail is safe and secure with systems and procedures built in to detect and prevent the counting of suspicious ballots.  He too has voted by mail and will this cycle but he knows that Democrats are more likely to vote by mail than his supporters thus his claims that it will be a fraudulent vote.  He is discussing and will likely claim that only votes cast on November 3 2020 are valid and his desire to pick RBG's successor may be part of his efforts to undermine the count. (Not all states count mail ballots on election day some by state law are prevented from counting earlier.)  Included may be votes being cast now at early voting locations not made by mail since those are not cast on election day but prior. Much is in place to prevent such a calamity to democracy but this is Trump and AG Barr of whom we must be wary diligent prepared and responsive to as needed.  Not only must we vote but we must be prepared to protect that vote by any and all LEGAL mechanisms as established within each state. For it is the states not the federal government that conducts the voting and to have Trump Barr their sycophants or the Supreme Court interfere in the lawful and rightful conduct of voting will be ushering in authoritarianism at the highest level much akin to Putin's Russia.  So not only must we ""Choose Wisely"" but we must also be prepared to ensure that ""Each Lawfully Cast Vote is Counted""!  Be wary remain vigilant much like the first ""Minutemen""!

Amy Barrett  Immediately If Not Sooner President Trump has the right nominee at the right moment in American history. by SCOTT MCKAY September 19 2020 2:35 AM  When Ruth Bader Ginsburg died Friday evening she did so with a message for posterity which for all the history that Ginsburg might have made as a woman on the Supreme Court was pristine in its self-description of her time on the Court. My most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed she said. The arrogance of that was par for Ginsburgs course. The fact that Republican women havent been represented on the Supreme Court since Sandra Day OConnor rankles a bit; youve got to offer big parts of your base role models when you can. Yes yes Ruth Bader Ginsburg lived an interesting life and yes yes she was an accomplished woman. Those things are beside the point. It is neither ghoulish nor inappropriate to look to the future of the United States Supreme Court upon her death rather than pay tribute to the life she lived. After all that life was for all practical purposes long since over months ago when Ginsburg chose to spend her time on deaths door occupying space on the Supreme Court in an effort to outlast President Trump. And Ginsburg practically begged us to engage in nominatorial exegesis upon her death with the unfortunate quote referenced above. That her gambit failed despite practically every responsible pundit and political voice in the country either whispering or shouting the lack of wisdom involved in Ginsburg persisting on the court long after she should have recognized her failing health and retired is not the fault or responsibility of President Trump. She was 87 years old for crying out loud. Were Trump to be re-elected did she honestly expect to linger on the Supreme Court until she was 91? Or 92? In her failing health? The vanity of Ginsburgs attempt to hold the seat for the Left regardless of the Supreme Court balance that entails did not reflect well on Ginsburg. It was an affront to American democracy not something to be given credit for. She was advised to retire years ago when Barack Obama could have appointed her replacement. She gambled on Hillary Clinton and she lost. That was Ginsburgs problem. Not Americas. Donald Trump has a Republican Senate majority and he has a candidate who has been recently vetted ready to go. There is no secret that Amy Coney Barrett currently of the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals is a favorite of the presidents to succeed Ginsburg and Barrett ought to be nominated forthwith. Truth be told Barrett would have been an appropriate if not a superior choice for either of the last two Supreme Court vacancies. Thats not a slur against Neil Gorsuch or Brett Kavanaugh both of whom were qualified and competent justices. Its just that Barrett is exactly the kind of Supreme Court Justice Trump wants and needs and with Ginsburg leaving the court on terms not quite her own but certainly terms she dictated there is no reason to wait. Why Amy Barrett? Start with the political. This appointee needs to be a woman. Yes as conservatives we hate the idea of quotas and checklists but its an election year. And since Trump didnt go with a woman to replace Anthony Kennedy or Antonin Scalia he has to go with one to replace Ginsburg. Besides the fact that Republican women havent been represented on the Supreme Court since Sandra Day OConnor rankles a bit; youve got to offer big parts of your base role models when you can. Not to mention that the Left has lived on Ginsburg as a folk hero and feminine role model for decades. Theyve made movies about her theyve turned her into an icon. Theyve almost completely ignored Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor as cultural figures something theyll now likely remedy. But Barrett is something different than Kagan and Sotomayor. Shes not only a stellar brilliant jurist shes also a regular American. No lets rephrase that. Amy Coney Barrett is no regular American. Shes extraordinary but in ways regular Americans can admire. For example and this is important she isnt another Ivy League elitist judge. While the Supreme Court is loaded down with law school graduates from Harvard and Yale Barrett is a Notre Dame graduate. Thats a big deal. The most important imbalance on the Court isnt that it has too many men or too many white people or too many conservatives  its that it has too many people who come from a very insular elitist perspective that does not reflect the experience of ordinary Americans. Amy Barrett is neither East Coast nor West Coast. She grew up outside of New Orleans attended elementary and middle school at St. Catherine of Siena Catholic School in the middle-class suburb of Metairie St. Marys Dominican High School in the city graduating in 1990 and then Rhodes College in Memphis. Barrett obtained her law degree from Notre Dame then after a pair of clerkships for distinguished jurists Lawrence Silberman and Antonin Scalia and a couple of stints at well-respected private law firms became a law professor at Notre Dame for several years before her nomination to the 7th Circuit in 2017. Barretts confirmation to the 7th Circuit was a disaster for the Left. It included the famous gaffe by Californias Dianne Feinstein in which the latter essentially attempted to disqualify Barrett for having deeply held Catholic beliefs as though that made her akin to a cult member. The dogma lives loudly within you and thats of concern when you come to big issues that people have fought for for years in this country Feinstein told Barrett during the confirmation hearings in a moment most Democrats would like to forget. What underlay that exchange was a 1998 article published in the Marquette Law Review that Barrett had written offering a very thoughtful analysis of the considerations Catholic jurists would run into regarding issues like euthanasia abortion and the death penalty. Barrett said during the confirmation hearings that were she to be a trial judge she couldnt see herself entering an order of execution but that as a clerk for Scalia at the Supreme Court she had advised the Justice on capital cases and would be bound by the Constitution rather than Catholic teaching on matters of the law. And that was the gist of the law review article  its conclusion was not that the dogma would control over the Constitution but that in cases where the two should conflict it might be reasonable for a Catholic judge to consider recusal under certain circumstances. It was an excellent performance one which put Barrett on the map as a potential Supreme Court justice and Barretts demeanor and poise in handling Feinsteins rather obnoxious assault was eye-opening in a positive way. When Sen. Dick Durbin embarrassed himself asking Barrett whether she was an orthodox Catholic and when the idiot Al Franken attempted to make her out as a homophobe because she had delivered a lecture on constitutional law at a seminar put on by the Alliance Defending Freedom on the basis of a laughable designation of ADF as a hate group by the far-left terrorist inspirers at the Southern Poverty Law Center it became quite clear that Amy Barrett is not someone the Democrats can beat down in a confirmation hearing. Presenting Amy Barrett to the Senate for Supreme Court confirmation would tee up yet another potential disaster for the Democrats just like her confirmation for the 7th Circuit was and it would do so when virtually every American is watching intently. Shes young in her late 40s. Shes a mother of seven including two adopted children from Haiti she lives a middle-class lifestyle (her husband Jesse Barrett is a prosecutor in the U.S. Attorneys office in Chicago) shes attractive shes exceptionally well-spoken and an excellent compelling speaker on the law and the Constitution. She also boasts an outstanding perspective as a mother of seven whos been a lawyer a law professor and a federal appellate judge on the question of how women might balance a career and a family. Barrett has said that women shouldnt be pigeonholed into specific roles based on other dogma on the issue; rather the individual circumstances should govern and nobody should assail their choices out of some feminist or traditionalist perspective. Thats a healthy viewpoint the majority of American women and particularly middle-class or upper-middle-class women in the suburbs will find wisdom in. Which is a trap the Democrats could easily fall into seeing as though so many of them have taken on the perspective that women who choose family over a career are somehow selling themselves short or are traitors to their sex and seeing as though the Left is insistent on forcing women to adopt more and more unrealistic ideals for themselves at an increasing cost to the happiness of women in America. Nobody would accuse Amy Barrett of that but to paint her as barefoot and pregnant because she has seven kids including two adoptees from Haiti and one with Down Syndrome will be an unmitigated disaster in front of suburban women far more likely to see her as a hero. You guys want to alienate the rest of the Catholics you havent pissed off? You want to drive away those suburban white chicks youre competitive with because of Trumps mean tweets the ones you had a brief flirtation with in the 2018 midterms but who are ignoring your texts thanks to the mostly-peaceful riots just a few miles away from where they do yoga a couple of days a week? Go make a run at (Kavanaughing) Amy Barrett. Lets see how well that works for you. Get this done now President Trump. Dont wait. Your correct nominee has already been on a Supreme Court short list. She was in the final three when Kavanaugh was selected and she was the woman of the bunch. She will be on the Supreme Court for the better part of three decades maybe longer and she will become an icon of American jurisprudence and a cultural figure who makes a joke of the Lefts narrative about the patriarchy or even white privilege  shes far more impressive and relatable than anyone on the scene griping about such Marxist tropes. And if anyone screams about the speed of the nomination or the rapidity by which it moves through the Senate those things are easily dispatched. The Supreme Court begins to hear cases in the first week of October. Having nine justices on that court is important for the country. By all rights this nomination and confirmation should have been dispensed with months if not years ago. It isnt Donald Trumps fault but Ruth Bader Ginsburgs that we come to this crossroads now with the presidential election so near. Ginsburg didnt die suddenly; shes been too ill to effectively serve on the court for months if not years. The Weekend At Ruthies memes are old and tired theyve been around so long. That kind of obstinance driven by pure partisan hackery on Ginsburgs part abetted by the Democrat party establishment possesses no rational argument for its own reward. The Republicans have the power granted to them by the American people in the 2018 elections when the GOP won enough Senate seats for a 53-47 effective majority and by former Majority Leader Harry Reid when the latter exercised the nuclear option to eliminate the filibuster on federal judges to push through a nominee. Three of those Republicans Mitt Romney Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski have expressed objection to voting for a Supreme Court confirmation prior to the election but Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Friday night there will be a vote. Even without Romney Collins and Murkowski there are 50 votes for Barrett  and thats before Doug Jones the Democrat from Alabama who is likely to get clobbered by former Auburn head football coach Tommy Tuberville in that states race is put to the question. Jones political prospects are such that a yes vote on Barrett might be the only hope he has at staving off extinction. Even without Jones vote and a worst-case scenario among faithless GOP senators its a 50-50 tie that Vice President Mike Pence who was governor of Indiana when Barrett was a law professor in that state at Notre Dame can break. In other words this nomination is there for the confirming it gives the country an excellent Supreme Court justice who will do excellent service for a protracted period of time its a transformational choice which creates a new Supreme Court for the 21st century its a political win which delivers Catholic voters and suburban women for the presidents party it creates a feminine cultural icon setting precisely the right tone and it demonstrates once and for all to conservative voters that unlike the Republican Party of the Bush era this GOP has the will and the sand to deliver on its promises. On big items. With big stakes. For lasting change. Make Amy Barrett happen Mr. President. Dont think twice dont wait. Move the nomination forward and work with Sen. McConnell to ram it through with all possible speed. You wont regret it  in fact the political capital it will give you will seal the election not just for you but for your allies down the ballot in November.,political,Facebook

Okay. I had some wine. Cried. Zoomed and commiserated with friends. I read the headlines yelled at my TV screen and my computer. Just when I thought I could not be any more disgusted with this country or its leadership I found the well could go deeper. The hypocrisy of McConnel and Lindsay Graham knows no bounds. Instead of mourning and celebrating the life of one of our finest American citizens we are left bickering and fighting over the actions of men who do not deserve to walk the halls of our greatest institutions let alone sit in the seats of the Senate. May history judge them as the most incompetent people to ever hold office. Worse however are the people who continue to support these politicians. Those that excuse their actions as politics as the last defenders of America from the evil left are just as unforgivable as those that they support. But even worse there is nothing for them to gain from this support other than the ugly sideline cheering of despots and strongmen. These people are just as responsible for our current state of affairs as the ugly politicians they support. Most of them are in an abusive co-dependent relationship with their representatives and they do not even realize it. Their love of unborn babies blind patriotism and stars and stripes are going to destroy this country. Patriotism is not about blindly and unquestioningly following politicians and/or policy. Patriotism is about standing up when you see that something is wrong speaking out and demanding change.  This country is broken the death of RBG is enough to snap the fine threads holding this country back from civil war. Our only saving grace might come on November 3rd. If we fail to elect Biden and Harris to the Executive office America will be irreparably changed forever. There will be no turning back from our slide to authoritarianism and darkness. Men like Donald Trump Bill Barr and Stephen Miller will be cemented into positions of power that will destroy what is left of our institutions. Those that support these monsters will suffer even more and never understand why. Their deep belief in god country and dogma will be our ultimate undoing. Their blind faith in people who care nothing about them will be the final bet won and the devil will dance. We said it could never happen in America that our institutions would stand the test of time. We were wrong. We were warned over and over again. We failed to listen. We failed to see. The pages of history had lessons to teach us. We did not pay attention. George Washington said it best in his farewell address to the Nation. I beg you to read his words and carry them as a shield and as a beacon of light for those who have lost their way:  The unity of government which constitutes you one people is also now dear to you. It is justly so for it is a main pillar in the edifice of your real independence the support of your tranquility at home your peace abroad; of your safety; of your prosperity; of that very liberty which you so highly prize. But as it is easy to foresee that from different causes and from different quarters much pains will be taken many artifices employed to weaken in your minds the conviction of this truth; as this is the point in your political fortress against which the batteries of internal and external enemies will be most constantly and actively (though often covertly and insidiously) directed it is of infinite moment that you should properly estimate the immense value of your national union to your collective and individual happiness; that you should cherish a cordial habitual and immovable attachment to it; accustoming yourselves to think and speak of it as of the palladium of your political safety and prosperity; watching for its preservation with jealous anxiety; discountenancing whatever may suggest even a suspicion that it can in any event be abandoned; and indignantly frowning upon the first dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest or to enfeeble the sacred ties which now link together the various parts.,political,Facebook
GET OFF THE TRUMP ECONOMIC TRAIN ! ITS HEADED DOWN   Trumps economic plans have been shown to be the emperors new clothes. Hollow at the start by emphasizing tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires instead of investment irresponsible petty tariff policies that have gutted many family farms and small businesses and the Crown Jewel Of Failed Economic Policy: Trumps Pathetic Covid19 Response. 1.Almost 7 million cases of Covid19 and the associated cost of medical care and people lost to the labor force. 2.Huge economic drop caused by business closing to prevent the Covid19 spread that Trump did practically nothing about for two months. 3.Between 20 and 30 million newly Unemployed Americans Wiping out years of job gains. And The Republicans in the Senate are blocking needed additional unemployment benefits. 4.And the most Tragic of all the Permanent Loss Of American Consumers: One hundred ninety-nine thousand five hundred thirty-one (199531) Unnecessarily DEAD AMERICANS as of 11:18 AM September 21st according to Johns Hopkins.

Should the current President be able to fill a vacant supreme court position 43 days before an election. Personally I think not. I think once the nominees are selected it should wait until after the inauguration. This has nothing to do with Trump it has to do with my feelings that once we know who the nominees are the people should be able to choose the direction of the country.

"I regret the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. She was certainly an accomplished woman but not a great judge. She was not impartial or neutral. In my opinion the most important quality of any judge is neutrality in judgement. A judge does not judge based on race color religion or wealth or any other quality. A judge particularly a Supreme Court Judge judges all people rich and poor black and white with equality. She let her liberal views and ideology interfere in her judgement. That does not make you a good judge. You are no Solomon of a judge or wisdom when you allow your personal views to get in the way of your judgement and rulings.She called President Trump a ""faker"". A justice of The United States Supreme Court does not call The President of The United States a faker or refer to him in any other derogatory name or manner. She showed her disrespect and dislike of The President in no uncertain terms. She also did not follow her oath to uphold The Constitution and not to re- interpret it according to her leftist ideology. She also made it very clear that she would do anything in her power not to allow Trump to elect a new justice instead of her. Unfortunately death does not calculate when it comes based on politics or a persons wishes or their ideology and personal prejudices. She went on to say that Trump "" has no consistency"". "" He says whatever comes into his head at the moment"". "" He has an ego"" she said about Trump. Trump unsuccessfully asked her to resign. She did not ! Now all the news is praising her and saying how great she was and glorifying her and her ""candor"" ! But the truth is she failed as a Justice of The Supreme Court by being biased in her views. Death does not ask for resignation or retirement it commands it at will. Death out candors everyone ! Her wish her dying words were ""my most fervent wish is that I not be replaced until a new president is installed"". ALAS death is the ultimate decision maker of life even for a liberal SCOTUS Judge.Rest in peace justice Ginsburg. President Trump should immediately nominate a new justice and the Senate should confirm the nomination without any delay. Elections have consequences but death has even more consequences.",political,Facebook

"Ok Joe Joe Biden you win the ""nice guy award"" of the decade. Maybe even of the century. You are so nice so decent so compassionate . You sound so honest and sincere and caring and when you talk so softly you just make me want to cry. You arouse my sense of pity and bring out the human in me. we would otherwise all be so selfish and deplorables and irredeemables. You have ""empathy""  ""You reward work not wealth"". Did those that become wealthy not work.? Did they not create jobs ? You are an expert but an expert in dividing people. The poor against the rich and the blacks against whites. You are an expert in dividing one American against another.There is only at least 47 reasons that all you say is crap and complete lies ""make believe"" and ""demagoguery."" You have had 47 years to practice your hypocrisy and dirty politics and make yourself rich on the back of American workers that you betrayed for China and Mexico and other countries. You totally divided the people and destroyed the economy and jobs. Didn't you say that if you can go deep down in a mine you can also learn ""programming"" and ""coding"". You want to build the ""jobs of the future"" but you did that with your master Obama. Now we rely on China for almost everything essential including life saving medicines.You had 8 years as Vice President and betrayed America. Then prior to that you were a corrupt senator for almost 40 years. Now all of a sudden you will wave a magic wand and fix everything that you destroyed for 47 years. I am happy you found that magic wand that your master Obama did not find.Were you hiding the wand all this time ? You would be a curse to America if you get elected. You can say Trump is to blame for 190000 deaths from Covid but we would have lost millions of lives if you were in charge. Remember your calling him a "" xenophobe""when he banned travel from China ? You have not condemned the rioting and looting and anarchy until your handlers and the corrupt MSM told you that it was hurting you in the polls. JoeYou would make a great ""Clown in Chief"" but never a ""Commander in Chief"" or a President. You are not a leader but you have mastered the art of cheating and conning the people for decades. Joe Biden the wizard of Washington the master of deception. All we have heard from you and your party is how bad Trump is. The reason for that is that you have nothing to offer no agenda no solutions definitely no principles or character. Let the polls rule Joe blow with the winds of the fake polls.

If you are a Catholic or other Christian Jew Muslim or other person opposing Abortion I recommend you read John Carrs essay to help with your decision about Biden or Trump. Thank you.  Full disclosure: I personally oppose abortion with the exception of rape incest health of the mother or the inability of the fetus to survive outside of the womb. I support healthcare solutions such as widespread availability of free birth control for both women and men and universal healthcare. I do not support legislative solutions because frankly they dont work. I am voting for Biden/Harris.  This article is from America Magazine the Jesuit Review  POLITICS & SOCIETYFAITH AND REASON I helped write the bishops first document on Catholics and voting. Heres why Im voting Biden not Trump.  John Carr September 17 2020 (From his essay) While I understand that others will come to different conclusions my personal choice to support Vice President Biden is clear but not without reservation. To frame this judgment in the words of Faithful Citizenship I believe Mr. Trumps character lack of integrity and record on racism and Covid-19 among other matters constitute morally grave reasons to oppose his re-election. I believe Mr. Biden has the character [and] integrity to lead our nation and is more likely to pursue other authentic human goods. I will vote for Mr. Biden for what he can do to help us recover and heal lift up those left behind ensure health care for all and treat immigrants and refugees with respect. I will not vote for him to support his position on abortion but in spite of it.  (Chucks Recommendations: Biden McGrath Owensby In KY04 and Hicks KY06),political,Facebook

I also have Catholic Jewish Mormon Muslim and non-believer family and friends. I believe we are all welcome in America.  Im opposed to abortion just like many of you. I believe in exceptions for rape incest health of the mother and inability of the fetus to survive outside the womb. I believe better than legislation good health care including free birth control is the key to reduced abortions. Free birth control is part of the current Federal Law for inclusion in all Health Insurance. Protection for Pre-Existing Conditions is also part of the current Federal Law for inclusion in all Health Insurance. I believe the current administration should stop trying to take that Federal Law away from all of us.  Im the descendant of immigrants just like many of you. I have friends that are First Generation Immigrants just like many of you have. I have family members and friends that are descendants of African Slaves just like many of you. I have family members that are part Native American just like many of you.  Im concerned about the poor reputation of our country in the world just like many of you.  Im a supporter of the U.S. military just like you. I have many veterans and active duty military in my family just like you. I support good Veterans care just like you. I respect our All-Volunteer Military just like you. I respect our Drafted Veterans that served just like you.  Im a straight married guy just like many of you. Unlike some of you I have a lesbian family member. I love her so dearly I performed her wedding ceremony to her wife a few years ago. They are like second daughters to me I love them so much. I support LGBT rights.  Im a White guy just like many of you. Like many of of you I worry about the safety of my family. I worry about the safety of my extended family. I worry about the safety of my friends families. Unlike some of you I have an African-American niece and two beautiful African-American grandnieces. I worry about their safety as they grow up. Unlike me as a White man to be safe they have to be extra careful in America wherever they go.  I support the majority of those serving as our police just like you. Because I support the police I want them to operate to protect all Americans including my African-American Niece and her African-American daughters. Because for years now African-Americans are being shot and killed by police at two and a half (2.5) times the rate of Whites like me my nephew and niece have to teach their African-American daughters extra safety measures. As they grow older unless we change policing they will be in danger of being shot and killed by police for being American while Black.  I support the peaceful Black Lives Matters demonstrators fighting for changes in policing.  Im on Social Security just like many of you. Im concerned about the security of the Social Security Trust Fund just like many of you.  Im very concerned about our National Debt just like many of you. In fact one of the times I didnt vote Republican I voted for Ross Perot in 1992 like many of you because I was so concerned about the National Debt. I was very concerned about the 2017 Tax Cut because it did not turn out as promised. The Individual Tax Cut was limited small Temporary and only 15% of the total. The Corporate Tax Cut was huge Permanent and more than half of it was immorally used by Large Corporations just to buy back their own stocks; not as we were promised for new investments or improved workers wages and benefits. Worse It did not pay for itself as promised. Its adding $1.5 to $2 Trillion to our already bloated National Debt.  Im concerned about medical costs just like many of you. Im on Medicare just like many of you. Im worried about Medicare funding just like many of you.  Im concerned about Covid19 just like many of you. Im an older person at higher risk just like many of you. Im concerned because I have pre-existing conditions making me more susceptible to Covid19 just like many of you. Im concerned about this Global Pandemic that has already killed 188942 Americans and 889364 people worldwide just like many of you.  As I said at the beginning I am a Lifelong Republican just like many of you. Since 1972 I have usually voted Republican for President just like many of you.  I have decided this year to Vote Democrat for President as many other Lifelong Republicans are doing.  I would ask you to consider joining me and voting for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.

The geographical divide pitting the blue ocean coasts against the red interior is partly culture to be sure. Social liberals are heavily concentrated on the coasts while social conservatives especially White Evangelical Protestants are heavily concentrated in the South and Midwest. Yet the blue-red divide has a crucial socioeconomic dimension as well.  Though Democrats had been considered the party of the working class since the New Deal they carried the richest counties and lost in many of the poorest in 2016. Understanding that fact is key not only for the Democrats to retake the White House but for the country as a whole to reunite in a common purpose. As candidate Joe Biden seems to be conveying the right messages.  Democrats have become the party of social progressives African Americans and other minorities environmentalists and younger voters as well as the party of those with bachelor's degrees or higher. Republicans meanwhile became the party of social conservatives especially Evangelicals and increasingly of White working-class and older voters.  Rapid technological changes have pulled blue and red states apart economically notably most advanced in the blue states. Democratic Party strongholds on the two coasts are heavily oriented towards the high-tech service sectors while staunch Republican Party regions in the interior are heavily concentrated in the goods sectors such as manufacturing and fossil fuels.  The economies driving blue states are based heavily on professional sectors that draw on a workforce with bachelor's degrees or higher. Meanwhile the goods-producing sectors of red states including agriculture and forestry mining construction and manufacturing and draw on a workforce with much lower rates of college completion.  When comparing election outcomes to data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis Clinton carried 17 of the 20 states with relatively large service sectors while Trump carried 27 of the 30 states with relatively large goods sectors. The 15 states with the highest proportion of employment in mining logging construction and manufacturing all went for Trump while 9 of the 10 states with the lowest proportion of workers in goods-producing sectors went for Clinton. Clinton carried the states with high-tech services. All 15 states with the highest proportion of adults with advanced degrees (post-Bachelor's) went for Clinton while 24 of the 25 states with the lowest proportion of advanced degrees went for Trump.  Thirteen of the 15 richest states (ranked by median household income) voted for Clinton while 22 of the poorest 25 states voted for Trump. These high incomes reflect the earnings of the high-tech professional sectors.  Voters in red states that both produce and use fossil fuels more heavily have been wary of plans to decarbonize the economy. In 1979 employment in manufacturing peaked at 19 million jobs but declined to around 12 million by the time of the 2016 election. By 2016 many industrial workers felt that the Democrats were no longer representing their interests.  Trump swooped in on these states during his first campaign to wrest many of them from Democrats charging them with ignoring their job plight. He claimed that the jobs had been lost to China Mexico and immigrants and that he would restore the jobs through protectionism and anti-immigrant policies. These arguments were grossly exaggerated and ignored the forces of automation which has led to an increase in output of goods despite fewer workers thanks to robotics and other technological advances.  He prevailed with an aggressive though utterly false and blatantly racist narrative. He told red-state voters that China and Mexico had stolen their jobs and that he would return them. He blamed immigrants for many of the red-state ills. He promised to resurrect the red-states' fossil-fuel industries.  In fact Trump's remedies have been so much hocus-pocus. The number of those employed in manufacturing in 2019 remained well below 2008 numbers. The number of manufacturing jobs in August 2020 was 247000 less than at the start of his term in January 2017. He did not and could not bring jobs back from China since most of the job decline in industry reflected automation not trade and since even jobs squeezed out of China by US tariffs will simply shift jobs to Vietnam or other low-income but highly productive countries.  Moreover Trump has not and could not resurrect the coal oil and gas industries. His promises to do so are recklessly blind to the world's shift away from fossil fuels and towards green energy due both to the climate crisis and also to falling costs of renewables. Jobs in mining and oil and gas extraction are down by 30000 since Trump took office and will fall further as America's declining and money-losing fossil-fuel production is replaced by wind and solar power. The S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production stock index is down 51.5% over the past year while the Clean Energy S&P is up 50.7% over the same period.  He did not and could not create decent red-state jobs by clamping down on immigration since immigrants were never the cause of red-state job woes to begin with.  He also promised a boom in construction jobs building new infrastructure across the US but he failed to do so as he lacked any serious vision of what the country needs.  Democrats now have the opportunity to reunite the nation by creating jobs across all regions. They should offer an industrial plan to build the next generation of electric vehicles smart grids advanced batteries and green fuels (such as hydrogen produced with renewable energy) -- all of which would create new jobs throughout the industrial heartland.  The Democrats can win over the natural-resource states by playing to their great strengths: massive low-cost renewable energy (especially wind and solar power) and new mining resources for advanced batteries electric vehicles wind turbines and other parts of the new industrial economy.  The Democrats should also lead on the long-delayed modernization of infrastructure: interstate transmission lines to carry renewable energy; buildings retrofitted for electrification and energy efficiency; charging stations and other facilities for electric vehicles; transmission pipelines for hydrogen and other green fuels; and a 5G network for advanced digital services. -Jeffrey D Sachs,political,Facebook

Just the facts! THE STOCK MARKET IS NOT THE ECONOMY!  Don't BUY THE CON!  Best Jobs President of all time?  During the last three years of the Obama administration 8.1 million jobs were created according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. During the first three years of the Trump administration only 6.6 million jobs were created.  Best economic growth ever?  Trump inherited a thriving economy. By just about any important measure the economy under Trump did not do as well as it did under Presidents Dwight Eisenhower Lyndon Johnson or Bill Clinton. The gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 2.3% in 2019 slipping from 2.9% in 2018 and 2.4% in 2017. But in 1997 1998 and 1999 GDP grew 4.5% 4.5% and 4.7% respectively. Yet even that period paled in comparison against the 1950s and 1960s. Growth between 1962 and 1966 ranged from 4.4% to 6.6%. In 1950 and 1951 it was 8.7% and 8% respectively. Meanwhile the unemployment rate reached a low of 3.5% under Trump but it dipped as low as 2.5% in 1953.  The BBC explained that Trump wasnt even doing as well as his political nemesis former President Barack Obama. For 2019 the data shows an annual average growth of 2.3% ending the year at 2.1% for the fourth quarter. This is significantly less than the 5.5% peak achieved in the second quarter of 2014 during the Obama presidency. And if you go further back there were times in the 1950s and 1960s when GDP growth was even higher. Megan Black an assistant professor of history at the London School of Economics told the network If you choose to look at the health of the economy based on GDP Mr. Trumps claims are suspect when compared to the national economic boom of the post-War years.  Tax cuts trickling down?  According to Forbes Trumps entire premise that the tax cuts are trickling down to families and sparking an economic boom is baseless. His tax cuts have not trickled down to workers theyve inflated deficits and by doing so they have put programs like Social Security and Medicare more at risk. Another Trump tax cut would threaten these programs even more.,political,Facebook

"We're told this is a free country. If so everyone has the right to vote for whoever they want in this year's election. If your informed research leads you to vote for Donald Trump feel free. I would suggest however that if you vote for Trump for any of the following reasons you've been had:  Because you think he's a devout Satanist-exterminating Christian; Because you think he's going to screw over a secret cabal of cultish ""black hats"" by abolishing the income tax; Because you think he's going to reveal the existence of Tesla-derived free energy to the world at some point after November of 2020; Because you think he's liberating thousands of sexually abused children locked up in Illuminati conclaves hidden within or below U.S. military bases; Because you think he's going to save your flesh from being masticated by the blood-spattered fangs of subterranean beasts. -Robert Guffey",political,Facebook

"The charlatan ""democrats"" are already setting up the whole world and the American people to deny Trump victory even if he wins. Mail in ballots is one of the tactics they are using to keep the turmoil alive and cheat the system.Their activist lawyers are all lined up to create havoc and confusion. They are on the offensive with the Goebbels method of propaganda. They are ""worried"" and ""concerned"" that if Trump ""loses"" he will not leave office. The translation of this is"" if he wins he has really not won and he will not leave office"" and we will have to force him out.

"""Fallout"" no matter what President Trump does it is a fallout or a scandal. A true leader a benign President tries to calm the nation he serves by not making the people panic or fear excessively when a tragedy strikes.Bob Woodward another democrat writer journalist  but really prostitute no insult intended toward prostitutes says The President ""downplayed"" the virus pandemic. Right away the other prostitute bought and paid for ""journalist""  Carl Bernstein Woodward's former Watergate ""partner"" appeared on CNN to comment on the ""travesty"" of The president. The whole thing could not have been more planned and rehearsed and calculated. !! You POS fraudulent duo clowns go ask Cuomo why he sent the elderly to early death with his careless actions in New York. Go question all your masters in the democrat party and the rest of your corrupt MSM crooks why they downplayed the Covid-19 virus months after President Trump acted. What is truly infuriating is their feeble and failed attempt in ""acting neutral ""or unbiased when it is all orchestrated and calculated. They have gotten used to getting away from their ""pretending"" and falsity for years. But no more the people know.  A good father or mother at home calm their young children when a calamity occurs. They do not jump up and down and start pulling their hair out or start shouting screaming and crying.They try to calm the situation by telling the young ones that they will survive despite the unforeseen tragedy. They display assurance and soothe the situation. When the Covid-19 came President Trump acted faster than anyone including the loser clown in chief Biden and the witch of San Fracisco Pelosi. However he also tried to avoid panic and fear for the nation. Now his words are as usual taken out of context and twisted to represent that he ""downplayed"" the pandemic. Biden called him a xenophobe and Pelosi was inviting people to China town in San Francisco to party. All the left were saying that life should continue as before. He banned travel from China and other countries and put an incredible team of doctors and other experts together. He appointed the VP to lead the defeat of the virus. Every time Pelosi or Biden open their mouths including Schumer and Schiff and Cuomo and so many other ""democrats"" they spew hate and propaganda and pure lies and nonsense but the fake news MSM never calls it a ""fallout"" ! Does anyone care or trust them anymore ? I don't think so ! I have not cared or paid attention to them for a long time.

"A CONSPIRACY THEORY B Part 1 Since this is section B it means you need to look up Section A  and section A has two parts so I will have to add at least another part to the section also. I an talking about A Conspiracy theory it will someday get in to discussing a real conspiracy probably but for now I am focused on the current situation we find our country in. There are many that accuse Trump of dividing the country but we have been a divided country for a very long time. The truth is that United States was always a divided nation where the people learned to live together and get along as the things changed we adjusted to the changes. We were divided even before the Civil war heck that is why there was a civil war we fought and then we adjusted we swept our differences under the rug but not for long soon we developed the Jim Crow laws in the south the racism went out a spread all over the country. There were lynchings in Montana Oregon had laws against blacks and so on. The federal and state governments passed laws to disenfranchise the blacks also. And this is not even the topic here. The fact is we know very little of our own history and yet we are proud that we know everything there is to know and we deny the truth and facts when presented as falsehood as they don't match our ignorance of them. Now there is theory being promoted that 9/11 was an inside job it is being promoted by the same people that support DJT for president and that DJT has actually accepted their support and promoted their ideology without however coming out and saying the same. So what is our reality and what is our truth. If 9/11 was an inside job then why hasn't Trump said so outright or is he using these people as useful idiots. The irony is that these same people are also the supporters of our military but they are not upset with Trump for insulting our armed forces. Something just doesn't add up unless someone is brain dead. How does one reconcile this? But are we not the same nation where white people on #foodstamps and #medicaid are against ""welfare"" because only the blacks are on welfare they think and people on #socialsecurity complain about #socialism. How do you fight this level of stupidity. More will follow M. N. R. 11 SEPTEMBER 2020  Yet it is the simple minds that search for simple solutions a complex problem is overwhelming it requires nuanced reaction it requires deep thought and meditation it requires knowledge patience and understanding it requires logic and methodology. O to be a simpleton. Yet the greatest nation in the world ever does not have the time the knowledge the logic and the study. Trump is not the first simple minded person Reagan was also simple minded but the difference is that Reagan listened to his advisors and for better or for worse he followed he followed through with his tax cuts and NAFTA he screwed the poor as all politicians are apt to left or right and the nation suffered he lied about a balanced budget and increased the deficits he went along with Iran-Contra his NAFTA deal destroyed the democratic cities and ruined their economy setting up the decline of black jobs and break up of unions and middle class. Today when Trump talks about the democrat run cities we need only to look back at NAFTA destruction of unions and globalization. But that is only one part the liberal mantra of sexual freedom is the other the destruction of family unit the spousal abuse the divorce rate single parent family is second. Add to that the drug problem both legal and illegal and abusive police tactics and you get 2020. Yes I have a master's degree I can write better but I like to write at a level that an average person can get the gist of my message. I have written about the economy at length also I post some of writings here again from time to time. You can follow the page and look. The problems we have today didn't happen overnight we had set up the ground work for the last 40 years or more. We only didn't know or didn't care no one did not Trump not Biden nor anyone else.  I posted earlier today. ""A dog is not aware that the master that throws him a bone every once in a while is himself eating the steak but the dog will fight another dog even to death over the bone thrown his way"". I ask my friends what do we want to take America back to? What is plan where is the map and will America look like when we have taken it back no one has an answer not even Mike Pence. I know where we are going if we don't change our ways liberal or conservative Republican or Democrat  we are going to hell in a hand basket of course. An we won't like it when we get there. Destruction of a nation should not be a matter of policy undermining of the #Constitution should not be the aim looting and burning or killing ""other fellow Americans"" should not be the plan of either side. But we are being led over the cliff by both sides. More will follow M. N. R. 13 SEPTEMBER 2020",political,Facebook

A citizen recent sent me a list of questions. Here is the list and my replies.  1) What is the identity of Pickens County in your eyes?  Pickens County is a storybook small AMERICAN hometown with a close knit generous and compassionate community. Most everyone is connected and everyone knows each other.  2) What are your goals to further define or change the identity of Pickens county?  I have no interest in changing the identity above. I truly desire to keep it small town without an increase in population. WE need to develop this county in a controlled way and with quality community-based needs. We need to make sure economically we are hiring locally. We need community events and connection opportunities that give off that vibrant & exciting small-town feel. Id like our main entry points to give our community a more rustic look as visitors enter into the North GA Mountains.  3) If you could pick a city as a role model for the future of Pickens county which Georgia city would you pick?  LaGrange. They have gardens parks breweries a first-class amphitheater grassy community space etc. The feel is energetic & exciting while still giving off that small-town feeling. The merchants and small businesses are thriving. Their intergovernmental agreements anti-litter campaigns and comprehensive plans are impressive.  4) How do you plan on implementing your vision for Pickens county with a budget that is limited how do you plan to free up cash or bring more cash in?  I dont think we are as limited as we think. We just need to use the money we have responsibly. Working with the current department heads to trim any fat just as I do now is priority. We need to think outside the box. One way is to become a destination area through Parks and Recreation and other amenities. Little league sports tournaments/complexes are cash cows. You have good people traveling and spending lots of money. Its good for local businesses as visitors need food drinks hotels VRBO rentals. This really capitalizes on SPLOST. Look at Hoover Alabama they are making a fortune off their sports facilities. I really like the RV Park incorporated into their park design. They paved a big area and made 170 spots available to RVs at $30 a night. They saw something similar to what we have in Pickens. A lot of people traveling through and needing a stopping place to stop and refresh. They stay at 25 percent capacity even when events are not taking place which is 400k in revenue. They also eat out and restock on groceries which brings in more SPLOST revenue. Look at the Tri-State Exhibition Center in McDonald TN. This type facility for car shows horse shows dog shows etc bring people that spend money! I can negotiate and arrange these revenue producers without raising our taxes!  5) What are your top three project goals for the board of commissioners during your term in office?  Wow! Thats a hard one as there is so much to improve on. These are not in order as they are all important. Again there is so much more to make better. First it isnt a project but a must is the transparency fairness and flow of county business. Our local government must be open honest and fluid with our citizens. Every last one of them is our employer. We also have to simplify government and it starts local. Getting a building permit should not be a hard process to figure out. Requesting a pothole to be filled should be a simple click on a computer or smart device. Everyone must be treated equally. 1  Roads Infrastructure and Public Services  We need an inter-city agreement with Jasper regarding sewer if not we might just need to build our own. We need a reservoir TRUMP has relaxed EPA requirements enough to do it now that doubles as water source and recreation area. We have serious road problems in the county needing addressed including some private road issues that need worked out. We need emergency responders in each Fire Station with ambulances. Grandma or little Johnny cant wait 30 minutes for an ambulance. ALL our workers need paid appropriately as we cant afford turnover. Happy employees are key to our success. I consider the animal shelter in this category. We need a new shelter with better areas for the animals to exercise. ABSOLUTELY no kill unless medically warranted and recommended by a vet. 2 - Amenities - Parks and Recreation was already discussed. Our children are going to Cherokee County for aquatics. An aquatic center would be used by or elderly citizens and could be a revenue generator for events. Kids arent playing other sports or they are going to Cherokee or Cobb to play. We need to incorporate activities for non-sports players and citizens with disabilities etc. Greenspace amphitheater dog park and Ag area are all part of my amenities plan. Again I can pull this off without a tax increase. The Pickens County Airport is a huge amenity and asset to this county. It could be the driver of economics. We have heavily invested in an unfinished project. FBO fences lengthen the runway needs to happen. This can be through grants. I am a huge supporter of General Aviation. 3. Economics  If we create the right environment to attract businesses that hire our citizens with career jobs we change our landscape. There are segments of industry that build out of site out of mind but employ a hundred people with top pay. UPS FedEx US Cold Storage are all looking for homes in North Georgia. These buildings are built on a track of land behind landscaping and only need water for their restrooms and dont pollute. This automatically fixes the housing situation as citizens being paid well can all of the sudden afford the house they cant now.,political,Facebook
CNN Con News Network CNN has a lot of traitors who think they are journalists.Don Lemon and Chris Cuomo are two of many truly despicable ones. Don Lemon was telling Chris Cuomo that the democrats have a blind spot because the polls are showing that the riots and the violence are hurting the democrats in the POLLS. Don Lemon you are disgusting. I do not judge you by the color of your skin or sexual preference. I judge you by your lack of decency and lack of character. I judge you by your arrogance and know it all attitude and unprofessional conduct. Chris Cuomo is no better but then again CNN has so many of the democrat propaganda con artists posing as independent news and journalists. Add Wolf Blitzer and Anderson Cooper to the list. So as not to have discriminated put Dana Bash and Erin Burnett and Alisyn Camerota to the list too. There are far too many to mention.  Your concern about the riots and the looting and violence was ONLY due to the polls ? In other words the lives and properties of innocent Americans was not of concern to you. Police being harassed and beaten and Trump supporters being shouted down and beaten and threatened was not important enough ? Shame on you and your associates and CNN.

"The fake news MSM do not realize that the people have realized how fake they are. For years they delivered their fake news subtly and acted "" impartial"" and pretended to have no bias. however after the election of President Trump they could no longer hide their prejudices and their propaganda and misinformation . Trump's victory infuriated them and made them come out of the woodworks. They could no longer tolerate hiding their lack of objectivity and complete partisan ideology. They are without doubt bought and paid for by the democrat machinery of government and it has been so for decades. CNN MSNBC The Washington Post The New York Times  ABC NBCCBS and so many more are an arm of the corrupt democrat party.  For decades they tried to at least show a neutral front. No longer it's out in the open they know it and most people know it. the only ones who do not know this fact are ignorant lazy unaware idiots. The democrats all know this as a fact. They no longer try to hide it or can hide it. This latest fraud vote by mail so blatantly obvious intended to cheat the system and rig the elections. Their gamesmanship is totally in the open. They do not even hide it or pretend otherwise. The main reason is that they no longer are accountable to the voters. They have enough fools to vote for them and to keep them in office.  Those that still think that they are hiding it from the ""aware"" voter or citizen have their heads buried in the sand but their bare asses are up in the air naked and visible to all observers. They are so stupid and so corrupt that THEY don't realize this fact.  I am talking of the Rachel maddows the Juan Williams the Donna Braziles the Don Lemons the Anderson Coopers and the Chris Cuomos and the Chris Wallaces and the Jake Tappers and the wolf Blitzers and the Brian Stelters and the Dana Bashes Erin Burnetts Jim Acostas Gloria Borgers Fareed Zakarias Jeffery Toobins and so many many more. Basically all of CNN and MSNBC and the rest of the MSM.  I must mention Joe Scarborough and Lawrence O'Donnell and Ali Velshi and the great Mika Brzezinski. They would be offended not to be mentioned in this list of journalist or hosts or news casters or news anchors or hosts or really FRAUDS which is the best word that describes them. Add to this list corrupt career politicians in power for decades. Pelosi Schumer Schiff Maxine Waters Jerry Nadler Joe Biden John Kerry The Clintons Bernie Sanders and again so many more including the new ones ""the squad"" Ilhan omar Rashida Tlaib AOC and Ayanna Pressley. I call them "" the gang of four"". The original gang of four where 4 advisers to Mao Zedong and controlled the power organs of the communist party of China through the later stages of the Cultural Revolution. Sound Familiar ?  They are all part of exposed and corrupt news organizations and part of the machinery of deceit and the failed democrat party.  Then we come to democrat run cities and states governors and mayors. Mayor De Blasio mayor Garcetti mayor Lori Lightfoot Jenny Durkan Ted WheelerJacob Frey London Breed. The governors include Andrew Cuomo Gavin Newsom J.B. Pritzker Gretchen Whitmer Ralph NorthamTim Walz and so many other failed democrat cities and states.  American news media was once the model of journalism and true information and part of the system of checks and balances. It was the envy of the world.

"WANT TO KNOW WHY WE ARE VOTING FOR TRUMP! IT'S YOU!.  If you are a liberal who cant stand Trump and cannot possibly fathom why conservatives would ever vote for him let me finally fill you in.  Its not that we love Donald Trump so much. Its that we cant stand you. And we will do whatever it takes  even if that means electing a rude obnoxious unpredictable narcissist (your words-not ours) to the office of President of the United States  because the only thing we find more dangerous to this nation than Donald Trump is you.  How is that possible you might ask? Well you have done everything in your power to destroy our country from tearing down the police to tearing down our history to tearing down our borders. You are systematically destroying our schools and brainwashing our kids into believing socialism is the answer to anything (despite being an unmitigated failure everywhere) while demonizing religion and faith and glorifying abortion violence and thug culture.  From calling us racists every time we expect everyone of any skin color to follow our laws equally to telling us that our tolerance of lifestyles we dont agree with isnt nearly enough....no we must celebrate any lifestyle choice or gender option (forget science) you throw our direction or you think its fine to calls us homophobic or some other degrading slur  and ironically all while lecturing us on hate speech. While you gaslight us about 52 genders polyamory grown men in dresses sharing public locker rooms with little girls and normalize the sexualization of young children you simultaneously ridicule us for having the audacity to wish someone a Merry Christmas or hang a flag on the 4th of July stand for the national anthem or (horror or horrors) don a MAGA hat in public. So much for your tolerance. Do you see why we think you are hypocrites??  Were also not interested in the fact that you think you can unilaterally decide that 250 years of the right-to-bear-arms against a tyrannical or ineffective government should be abolished because you cant get the violence in the cities you manage under control. Free-speech should be tossed out the window history erased and those who disagree with your opinions are fair game for public harassment or doxing. Spoiled children with nose-rings and tats who still live off their parents dime should be allowed to destroy cities and peoples livelihoods without repercussions. That chaos and lawlessness and disrespect for authority should be the norm. This is your agenda. And you wonder why we find you more dangerous than Donald Trump?  Your narrative is a constant drone of oppressor/oppressed race-baiting intended to divide the country in as many ways as you possibly can. You love to sell victim-hood to people of color every chance you get because its such an easy sell compared to actually teaching people to stand on their own two feet and take personal responsibility for their own lives their own communities and their own futures. But you wont do that. You will never do that because then you will lose control over people of color. They might actually start thinking for themselves God forbid!  This is why we will vote for Donald Trump.It is not because he is the most charming character on the block nor because he is the most polite politician to have ever graced the oval office. It is not because he is the most palatable choice not that we love his moral character or because he never lies. It is because we are sick to death of you and all of the destructive crap you are doing to this once beautiful and relatively safe country. Your ineffective and completely dysfunctional liberal leadership(?) has literally destroyed our most beautiful cities our public education system and done its damndest to rip faith out of peoples lives.  However bad Donald Trump may be (and he is far from perfect) every day we look at you and feel that no matter what Donald Trump says or does there is no possible way he could be any worse for our country than you people are.  We are sick to death of your stupid destructive ignorant and intolerant behavior and beliefs  parading as wokeness. We are beyond sick of your hypocrisy and B.S. We are fed up with your disrespectful divisiveness and constant unrelenting harping and whining and complaining (while you live in the most privileged nation in the world) while making literally zero contributions of anything positive to our society. Your entire focus is on ripping things down never ever building anything up. Think about that as there is something fundamentally very wrong in the psychology of people who choose destruction as their primary modus operandi.  If Donald J Trump is reelected rather than blame us look in the mirror and blame yourselves. Because you are the ones that are responsible for the rise of Donald Trump. You are the ones who have created this monster that you so despise by your very actions your refusal to respect your fellow Americans and the things that are important to us.  You have made fun of the fly-over states the people who cling to their guns and religion the middle class factory workers and coal miners and underprivileged rural populations that you dismissively call yahoos and deplorables. You have mocked our faith and our religion. You have mocked our values and our patriotism. You have trampled our flag and insulted our veterans and treated our first responders with contempt and hatred.  You have made environmentalism your religion while trashing every city you have taken responsibility for. You scream from the rooftops about global warming and a green new deal while allowing tens of thousands of homeless people to cover your streets in literal garbage needles and plastic waste without doing a single thing to help them solve the environmental crisis that your failed social policies are creating. But were supposed to put YOU in charge of the environment while gutting our entire economy to institute this plan when you cant even clean up a single city?? You complain  endlessly  yet have failed to solve a single social problem anywhere. In fact all you have done is create more of them.  Weve had enough. We are tired of quietly sitting by and being the silent majority. So dont be surprised when the day comes when we finally respond. And trust me its coming sooner than you might think. And also trust me when I say it wont be pretty. Get ready.  If Donald Trump is reelected it will be because you and your comrades have chosen to trash the police harass law-abiding citizens and go on rampages destroying public property that we have all paid for and you have zero respect for.  If Donald Trump is reelected it will be because we are sick of your complete and utter nonsense and destruction. How does it feel to know that half of this country finds you FAR more despicable than Donald J. Trump the man you consider to be the anti-Christ? Let that sink in. We consider you to be more despicable more dangerous more stupid and more narcissistic than Donald Trump. Maybe allow yourself a few seconds of self-reflection to let that sink in. This election isnt about Donald Trump vs. Joe Biden. This is about Donald Trump vs. YOU.  So if on the morning of November 4 (or more likely December 29 by the time the Supreme Court will weigh in on the mail-in ballot fiasco we are headed towards) if Donald J. Trump is reelected the only people you have to blame is the left-wing media drones and yourselves. You did this. Yep you!""  Time to walk away! BY- ANONYMOUS",political,Facebook

The campaign to reelect President Trump has great support everywhere. But I believe it is just as important to Hold the Senate and we have 6-8 seats possibly in play. Even if Trump lost McConnell could stall a lot of Bidens and the Lefts objectives until we could retake the House in 2022 win several state Governorships and Add to the Senate. Also 2022 Senate races 12 Dems 22 Reps so we must continue to work or we could lose Senate Control and have No Say in Government at all.,political,Facebook
To all my Republican friends: In 1984 I cast my first ever vote for President for Ronald Reagan. I voted for Republican in EVERY election until 2016. I voted Republican because Republicans led by Ronald Reagan believed in Small Federal Government and more State power. Believing that the closer decisions are made to us the people the better decisions will be made. I believed in a strong smart military. Republicans believed in a strong NATO and relationship with out Allies. Republicans believed that Russia China South Korea and Iran were our enemies. Republicans believed in Free trade. Republicans believed in sensible gun control. Reagan instituted the first gun control on automatic weapons. Reagan revered the FBI and Justice Department and all law enforcement.  By all these measures Donald Trump is not a Republican. He has bloated the Federal Budget and taken power from the states He disrespects the military and has weakened there moral and readiness. He has cozied up to China North Korea and Russia while considering leaving NATO and angering our allies He has instituted Tariffs on many countries destroying free trade. He has torn up trade contracts without replacing them with anything. He has bowed to the NRA and won't even discuss sensible gun control. Donald Trump has disparaged the FBI and Justice department destroying there morale.  If you support Donald Trump you can not also claim to be a Republican. Ronald Reagan would disagree with almost every policy of Donald Trump as Have George HW Bush George Bush John Boehner Michael Steele and many many other traditional Republicans.  If you support Donald Trump that is your right but DO NOT call yourself a Republican as you are going against every Republican principal of the last 40 years,political,Facebook

Dear Trump 2020 voters:  Im an American just like you. Im concerned about our country just like you.  Im a Lifelong Republican just like many of you. I have voted Republican for President most elections just like many of you.  Im a Protestant Christian believer just like many of you. I also have Catholic Jewish Mormon Muslim and non-believer family and friends. I believe we are all welcome in America.  Im opposed to abortion just like many of you. I believe in exceptions for rape incest health of the mother and inability of the fetus to survive outside the womb. I believe better than legislation good health care including free birth control is the key to reduced abortions. Free birth control is part of the current Federal Law for inclusion in all Health Insurance. Protection for Pre-Existing Conditions is also part of the current Federal Law for inclusion in all Health Insurance. I believe the current administration should stop trying to take that Federal Law away from all of us.  Im the descendant of immigrants just like many of you. I have friends that are First Generation Immigrants just like many of you have. I have family members and friends that are descendants of African Slaves just like many of you. I have family members that are part Native American just like many of you.  Im concerned about the poor reputation of our country in the world just like many of you.  Im a supporter of the U.S. military just like you. I have many veterans and active duty military in my family just like you. I support good Veterans care just like you. I respect our All-Volunteer Military just like you. I respect our Drafted Veterans that served just like you.  Im a straight married guy just like many of you. Unlike some of you I have a lesbian family member. I love her so dearly I performed her wedding ceremony to her wife a few years ago. They are like second daughters to me I love them so much. I support LGBT rights.  Im a White guy just like many of you. Like many of of you I worry about the safety of my family. I worry about the safety of my extended family. I worry about the safety of my friends families. Unlike some of you I have an African-American niece and two beautiful African-American grandnieces. I worry about their safety as they grow up. Unlike me as a White man to be safe they have to be extra careful in America wherever they go.  I support the majority of those serving as our police just like you. Because I support the police I want them to operate to protect all Americans including my African-American Niece and her African-American daughters. Because for years now African-Americans are being shot and killed at two and a half (2.5) times the rate of Whites like me my nephew and niece have to teach their African-American daughters extra safety measures. As they grow older unless we change policing they will be in danger of being shot and killed by police for being American while Black.  I support the peaceful Black Lives Matters demonstrators fighting for changes in policing.  Im on Social Security just like many of you. Im concerned about the security of the Social Security Trust Fund just like many of you.  Im very concerned about our National Debt just like many of you. In fact one of the times I didnt vote Republican I voted for Ross Perot in 1992 like many of you because I was so concerned about the National Debt. I was very concerned about the 2017 Tax Cut because it did not turn out as promised. The Individual Tax Cut was limited small Temporary and only 15% of the total. The Corporate Tax Cut was huge Permanent and more than half of it was immorally used by Large Corporations just to buy back their own stocks; not as we were promised for new investments or improved workers wages and benefits. Worse It did not pay for itself as promised. Its adding $1.5 to $2 Trillion to our already bloated National Debt.  Im concerned about medical costs just like many of you. Im on Medicare just like many of you. Im worried about Medicare funding just like many of you.  Im concerned about Covid19 just like many of you. Im an older person at higher risk just like many of you. Im concerned because I have pre-existing conditions making me more susceptible to Covid19 just like many of you. Im concerned about this Global Pandemic that has already killed 188942 Americans and 889364 people worldwide just like many of you.  As I said at the beginning I am a Lifelong Republican just like many of you. Since 1972 I have usually voted Republican for President just like many of you.  I have decided this year to Vote Democrat for President as many other Lifelong Republicans are doing.  I would ask you to consider joining me and voting for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. I believe they will lead us better than the current administration. Thank you for your consideration. Chuck Eddy Lexington KY  #RegisterToVote GoVoteKy . Com,political,Facebook
TRUMPSTERS! TAKE HEED!  On Nov 3 we are turning around the The Ship of State! DA 2020 (share if you agree)!  We will no longer tolerate Trumps attacks on the Rule of Law! Yes he claims this mantle for his campaign but in fact his administration flaunts the nations laws at every turn. It began with soliciting aid from a foreign country in the 2016 election Russia if you are listening. continued in repeated violations of the U.S. Constitutions emoluments clause foreign visitors at Trumps DC hotel Secret Service agents staying a Mar-a-Lago at inflated charges at his Scottish Golf Course Turnberry and at another in Ireland. Most recently in using the White House as a campaign backdrop in clear violation of the Hatch Act.  Speaking of lawlessness how many Trump officials or supporters have been indicted convicted etc. Paul Manafort Gen. Michael Flynn Rep. Chris Collins R-NY Duncan Hunter R-CA convicted pedophile George Nader donors Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman and of course Michael Cohen and his un-indicted co-conspirator Donald Trump. You get the picture!  Speaking of such diseases as Trump and his Administration lets examine Covid-19. (He confused it through his Covfefe 17 dementia.) Rather than listen to medical experts he listened to Shawn Hannity seriously Shawn Hannity. Hannity called it a Democratic hoax so being servile to Fox News on February 26 2020 Trump claimed 'that we had maybe 15 cases in the country and that they would all be gone soon.' New Flash! Not gone still here with thousands needlessly dead dead and gone gone forever.  Trump did not lead he followed he followed Hannity. He did not invoke the Defense Production Act to provide ventilators or personal protection he simply claimed that he was not responsible and foisted the virus upon the nations governors. It is what it is!  This is not what real leaders do real leaders step up to the plate they grab a bat they take a firm stance and they take a swing at whatever threatens the nation and the citizens they take an oath to protect. Trump merely bunted because it is all that he was willing or capable of doing. Mighty Casey might have stuck out swinging at Covid 19 but Trump cowardly tried a squeeze play and failed to advance the nations response to the virus. Death death death and massive unemployment and hardship this is the legacy of Trump!  Here we could detail the many additional failings of Trumps Presidency more foul smelling episodes from the Twilight Zone:   Coddling dictators Putin and Kim  Abandoning and demeaning our Allies  Undermining environmental protections  Withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accords  Withdrawing from the Iran Nuclear Agreement  Suppressing voting rights & Undermining Vote by Mail  Refusing to respond to lawful subpoenas for witnesses and tax returns  Kids in Cages  Showing no empathy for black lives  Coddling and encouraging white supremacists  On and  On and  On!  But now we learn consistent with his personality his narcissism his demeaning of John McCain and from multiple sources that our war dead and wounded are Loser and Suckers!  We think not you vile cretin you Agent Orange stain upon the tenants of American democracy.  We are empowered by our vote to reclaim Lincolns better Angels of our Nature; we will not suffer another moment more than necessary at your little hands at your little mind nor through your deaf dumb and blind supporters!  Rather Joe Biden the Joe We Know will fill the void of the past four years with experience intelligence empathy compassion equally capable administrators (not self-serving criminals) and take a swing at all that ails the nation yes including rioters and looters as set forth in his platform.,political,Facebook
POLITICS!!  I was visiting with my cousin one day during my campaign last cycle and she asked ew what is your thing with politics almost like I had told her I was going to become a snake handler. She sounded as though politics had nothing to do with her life and a person could simply choose to stay out of politics.  Politics is a part of everything we do. As an example there was a time when all of our groceries were individually marked with the price on the can or box or whatever. But then the Grocers Association fought to make it so that is no longer the case. If the bar code is on the product and the price is clearly marked on the shelf then the item doesnt need to be individually marked. In the bigger stores there are often times scanning devices placed strategically throughout the store that allow the customer to read the bar code and find out the price. Im not arguing for or against this process just saying grocery shopping is affected by politics.  I have been a news junky since I got satellite television in the late 80s. Before that I was fascinated by the occasional story that was on all the networks. I lived in rural areas of Rhodes Bentley and Standish since 1982 where there is no cable areas without great inexpensive internet. This is politics..  I worked for the Department of Health and Human Services for 22 years. During that time our name changed 3 times shortly after I retired it changed again. Politics. Working for the department gave me first hand knowledge of the inner workings of the government and politics and its affect on the people I served. I was a Childrens Protective Services worker and a familys and childrens advocate by trade. I grew up in a union family so I knew the importance of unions but in my work I became a union member and a union activist. Politics.  The other day I posted an ad regarding veteran and service member suicide in response to President Trumps alleged comments about those who have sacrificed so much for our country. I got called out very politely about making veteran suicide political. Veteran suicide is political. To not address veteran suicide as political would be negligent. I have been a supporter of veterans services since I was a young army wife myself in the early 70s.  In the aftermath of the dam failures in early May I addressed that as a political issue. There is nothing more political than the responsibility to keep people and their property safe. As your state legislator if you called my office and said I live in an area that is threatened by an unsafe dam with thousands of other families and children I would have done something! I would have pressured the agencies responsible with no regard to party or my own comfort level. I would have put it all on the line just like I did for all the vulnerable children and adults I served every day for 22 years. I may appear mild and meek on the outside but in a battle I am a fighter!,political,Facebook
"Joe Biden will be an ""American President"". Thank God for him clarifying that because I would have thought he may be a Haitian President or a Jamaican one. But he is a good man a decent man a just man a man with feelings and heart. Only one problem he never knew what he was doing and now he has no clue where he is and has dementia and early Alzheimer's disease.This clown in chief first ran for president 33 years ago yes 33 years ago and he had a little bit of sanity then.  Yes he is a dream President for China Russia and Iran but God help America if he is president. Trump ""cozies"" up to dictators and has no ""compassion"" Joe says ! Joe lies and cheats and says every lie he has to but he will protect America. He has gone through pain and suffering so he is the man to lead America. He will show dignity respect and honor and he will rebuild America he will build pipes to carry clean water he said. ""This is The United States of America"" he said.This is not a partisan moment but an American moment.Classical accuse your opponent of that which you yourself are guilty of ! This is always their best method of attack.Demonize your opponent with the demonic things you yourself do.  There is so much he will do ""come on man""  you know he can do it. Plus you know ""you ain't black if you don't vote for Joe"". So character and decency are on the ballot and that's all a superpower needs to govern 350 million Americans and the free world and compete with China and the world. Decency will beat Covid-19 and all the other world problems including any terrorism or extremism.Decency and character and trillions more in taxation will help climate change and global warming which is your biggest problem but you just don't know it.  Also Joe will end the ""season of darkness"" except him and his party have created it and continue doing so.......................................... yawwwwn  yawn oops excuse me had to yawn Joe is decent so you be decent too and forgive him for screwing the country and the world as VP for 8 years and as a senator for almost 40 years.

"Boo!"" the tall mask-clad White man yelled walking directly up to an elderly couple exiting a Republican National Convention event held on White House grounds on Thursday. Many Biden supporters have called for ""revolution"" too. They seem to want civil war. Nancy Pelosi said that if you are faithful to the constitution you promised to defend the Constitution against ""all enemies foreign and domestic"". She was encouraging those who committed violence against Trump supporters as fighting against ""domestic enemies"". Senator Rand Paul and his wife Kelley were terrorized last night while exiting the Trump convention. They are lucky to be alive and not injured. It is time for The United States government including The Department of Homeland security the FBI the National guards and police and even the army to use force to stop the violence and mob rule. The primary role of government is the protection of the people. There is no reason not to do that before the violence rises and kills more innocent people. The democrats the enemy within want to defund the police for treasonous reasons.They want to intimidate anyone that does not support them by mobs and violence and destruction. The bar can go no lower and this woman cannot be more vile and deranged.She is enemy number one of The United States of America and its people. It is time to be fully armed and ready for chaotic civil unrest thanks to the democrats and their encouragement of anarchy and racial division. They are clearly going to do everything in their power to promote violence to keep businesses shut down and to stop Trump from getting re-elected. If he gets elected the violence is not guaranteed to end. Unfortunately the unthinkable has happened and it might be impossible to control it. Be prepared to defend yourselves and your loved ones. I hope it never comes to that but remember think of the best and be prepared for the worst. That time might just be coming.",political,Facebook
"For once I agree with the drunk witch of San Francisco Nancy Pelosi. She says that there should be no presidential debates. It will be"" beneath the dignity of the presidency"" . She went on to further say that Biden should avoid any public debates so as not to"" legitimize"" any conversations with the US president. I agree because the whole world knows that Biden is beneath the dignity of the presidency and presidential debates. and is not capable of having a debate. Trump should not ""legitimize"" debating a mad man with Alzheimer's and who has lost control of his faculties and has dementia and wants to run for the office of the presidency. It will embarrass the US and make us all look like we are fools. Biden should stay in the basement and debate with himself maybe even have Kamala there for guidance. Despite the bogus excuses by Pelosi to cover up for the shortcomings and deficiencies of Biden of course they should debate ! Just wanted to make sure that we all know the real reason the witch of San Francisco Pelosi and the democrats do not want debates. After the debates the floor will be very clean because The President will have wiped the floor clean with Joe Biden. Make no mistake about that !",political,Facebook

"As Bruce's primary opponent continues to attack him yesterday Fred Doucette posted a piece to his Facebook page about next week's EC3 primary. It is worth a read - see below.  ""As the September 8th primary approaches Im following the District 3 Executive Council race closely. With Russell Prescott retiring this year several Republicans are seeking to succeed him. As people know I like and support Bruce Crochetiere. But as Ive watched their campaigns Janet Stevens has stood out  for all the wrong reasons. Not only has she been attacking Bruce but in her campaign materials she claims she will deliver conservative leadership on day one. Time to set the record straight on what being a conservative means to Stevens.  For Stevens being conservative meant supporting John Kasich during the 2016 presidential primary. The same John Kasich who spent the last few years increasingly opposed to the Second Amendment and protections for lawful gun owners. The same John Kasich who has gone on to become a CNN contributor and one of President Trumps fiercest critics. The same John Kasich that joined Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer in calling for President Trump to be impeached.  But that was our February 2016 presidential primary and there were many choices for President so maybe Stevens then proudly stood with President Trump after he secured the nomination. Right? Wrong. As recently reported by NH Journal in July 2016 as Republicans were nominating Donald Trump Stevens said of Kasich in a newspaper article Im hanging in there for 2020. Were waiting with open arms. Waiting with open arms for 2020  for John Kasich? She must have hoped either that President Trump would lose or that Kasich would primary him. Fortunately neither of those things happened.  But that was later in 2016 so maybe Stevens positions on Trump evolved after he was elected. Right? Wrong. Less than two years ago in November 2018 NH Public Radio did a story on a potential Kasich run for President in 2020  either to primary President Trump or as a third party. Janet Stevens was quoted in that story as an example of a voter who would be attracted to a Kasich 2020 candidacy. In the story Stevens described herself as a moderate centrist Republican  whoa hold on a second. She describes herself as a moderate centrist less than two years ago? In the context of supporting a fellow centrist like Kasich against President Trump in 2020? How does that square with delivering conservative leadership? It doesnt.  But that was November 2018 so maybe Stevens stood with the President in our 2020 presidential primary. Right? Wrong. While John Kasich chose a cushy CNN role over challenging our President someone else even more liberal decided to challenge President Trump in our 2020 presidential primary  former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld. The same Bill Weld who endorsed Barack Obama in 2008 and left the Republican Party a few years ago to run against Donald Trump in the general election. Weld is a dream Republican - pro-gun control pro-amnesty  if youre a Democrat.  In September 2019  just one year ago - Janet Stevens was announced as a member of Governor Bill Welds New Hampshire Leadership Team. Bill. Weld. Conservative move by Janet Stevens? Hardly.  While President Trump took on China Janet Stevens waited with open arms for John Kasich.  While President Trump nominated conservative judges Janet Stevens described herself as a moderate centrist and hoped for a Kasich run against President Trump in 2020.  While President Trump lowered taxes cut regulations and was attacked every day by liberal Democrats during a ridiculous impeachment process Janet Stevens stood with liberal Bill Weld against Donald Trump in our New Hampshire presidential primary.  So now  with the Executive Council primary around the corner  the Janet Stevens that supported John Kasich in the 2016 primary. The Janet Stevens that waited with open arms for Kasich in the summer of 2016 after the primary. The Janet Stevens that described herself as a moderate centrist in 2018 while hoping for a Kasich 2020 campaign. The Janet Stevens that was publicly announced as a member of liberal Bill Welds New Hampshire leadership team in 2019. And the Janet Stevens that got an F grade from the New Hampshire Firearms Coalition recently on 2A. Thats the Janet Stevens that now promises conservative leadership if elected?  I dont think so.  Bruce Crochetiere is a strong conservative we can trust.  Janet Stevens  who backed Bill Weld over President Trump and who waited with open arms for John Kasich the man who just spoke on behalf of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris at the Democrat convention - clearly is not.  The last thing we need to do is send a Weld/Kasich moderate centrist like Janet Stevens to Concord.""  Fred Doucette State Representative Asst.

Senator Kerry addressed the number of suicides among our veterans. He said that the reason the numbers are so high is that in many cases our veterans feel like they are suckers and losers.  I would like to take this time to honor our veterans and their service. I appreciate the commitment that it takes to volunteer to make the sacrifice. I am asking that if you are a veteran and feeling like a loser or sucker please contact someone you trust to talk to about your situation. Times are tough enough right now for so many of us but carrying around the burden of service related PTSD must be so much harder. Please reach out.  Thank you for your service and all you have sacrificed for our country.  Paid for by the Committee to Elect Celia Young-Wenkel. P.O. Box 535 Pinconning Mi 48650,political,Facebook

Joshua Ehrhart Career Interview  Joshua Ehrhart is an intelligent compassionate and multi-talented individual and also a good friend of mine. We met as kids at Synagogue and JCC and then over the years we sort of lost touch until we reconnected in Los Angeles when we were both living there. Joshua still lives and works in Hollywood. Please enjoy the interview!  What is the name of your position and company/organization?  Ehrhart Productions. Music Producer Artist Recording Engineer and Instrumentalist (mainly keyboards and I teach piano too.) Also Owner President and CEO.  Can you give a brief description of the work you are doing?  I work with clients on producing projects and I also work with other producers and assist them with their projects as well. That includes instrumental arranging mixing and vocal recording.  How did you get into this line of work?  I went to music school and studied audio engineering. You don't have to go but I recommend going. Knowing how to play piano and music theory is really helpful and also spending time getting good at recording. I recommend taking some audio engineering classes to get started and then practicing on your own by recording your own music. Record friends or amateur musicians and don't charge at first just practice to get good. If you enjoy it you're not doing it solely for the money. People will start hearing you and you can slowly start charging and raising your rates. Also you're going to want to start off with a simple recording setup at first and then as you get money from clients you can put that money into upgrading.  What does a day of work look like?  Hopefully it's booked with clients and hopefully your own projects. Most clients don't like to record in the morning so record yourself in the morning and hopefully later in the day you'll have paid clients and you can also work on promotion.  How do you get and stay mentally prepared/fit for work and your workday?  Mentally you've got to love what you do. If you don't love music you're better off doing something else that you love. Music and sound should inspire you as well as the people you're working with.  What has been the greatest challenge in your career?  Promoting and monetizing my talents. I'm kind of a quiet and shy person naturally and not a big talker so therefore I don't promote as much as I probably should. Some people are good at talking themselves up and I just prefer work but sometimes you've got to promote to get that work. The Donald Trump type personality tends to be very successful in the music and entertainment business.  What has been the greatest success or accomplishment in your career?  When I first started a lot of people told me I wasn't good at music that I couldn't learn to record that I couldn't learn to sing or wasn't capable of making money or making music. I hope that I have disproved that.  What elements of your workplace do you appreciate?  My recording studio is in my living room so I can create almost any time of the day that I want to. I don't have to rent a recording studio every time I want to work I can just do it on my own time.  What do you do to balance your work life with your personal life?  I try my best to keep regular business hours. I also try to work six days a week and no late night recording sessions unless someone's paying me a lot of money to do them.  What do you do after a stressful workday to relax?  I'll either hang out with friends or cook some good vegan food and watch a thriller on Netflix or all of the above.  Where do you see the future of your career going?  I'm going to be focused more on my solo artists and solo work and also a few collaborations I have in the works as well. I'm currently working on a song about the coronavirus it's called The Virus.  What advice would you give to a job applicant seeking work?  Learn to do it on your own. Then you won't have to apply. Learn as much as you can and get your own setup going. Learn many different ways. Go to school watch videos read books.  What is the most important general career advice you would give?  Choose something that you love and work hard at it. Don't think you can have too much education. Education is a good thing. Don't think you're better than anybody else just learn as much as you can.

We CANNOT let Stars and Stripes shut down. Ive personally known many of the incredible writers for this publication as Ive worked in the veterans space. Now President Donald J. Trump has put it in danger of shuttering because he and the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) apparently dont believe in holding leaders to account informing the public of the issues impacting servicemembers their families and veterans.  For many in the public who dont keep close tabs on our military happenings Stars and Stripes breaks down complex issues in a an easily digestible way narrowing the civilian military divide.  I am calling on Congressman  Senator  and to stop this harmful action in its tracks.,political,Facebook
Trumps Negligence Deceiving messages and actions in dealing with the Coronavirus has the USA with the most deaths in the World millions of unemployed thousands of small businesses going broke. And if you add that his four years law and order rhetoric has not to lead to solutions of understanding and compassion but to civil unrest riots and violence make us conclude unequivocal that not only Trump has to go on November 3rd but that we have to stop his doctrine now. now.. If you follow Trumps doctrine you dont care about protecting others. Dont need a mask dont need distancing dont need compassion to support justice!! And the Crisis is nothing it will disappear! and law and order rhetoric will continue to be just that rhetoric. If you follow Christ Doctrine everyone is a brother that you love and you protect! You wear a mask; you keep distance and promote love and justice. The Crisis is real and severe and only you can beat the Evil!! Who do you follow: Trump or Christ?,political,Facebook
"In light of the latest display of stupidity by the Trump administration do not think that his temping his followers to vote ""Twice"" is going to actually be a problem for liberals.  We are allowed one vote per person and there are several safeguards in place to prevent multiple entries by voters. These safeguards are in place to assure that it is one vote per person.  The incidence of voter fraud is extremely low since there are so many safeguards. However keep in mind that if liberals fall for the reverse psychology that Trump may be using and vote twice to retaliate we will be fulfilling their prophecy and risk going to jail on top of that.  So instead of worrying about Trump supporters (Yeah it sounds like a jock strap doesn't it?) voting twice do not fall for it because if anything they will be caught and wind up with a $5000 fine and 5 years in jail per incident even for attempting.  In other words do not stoop to their level and let them hang themselves in the process.",political,Facebook

"Today let's talk about... SACRIFICE. As in human sacrifice.  Many times in the past America has asked its soldiers to risk their own death and/or kill others. It has always purported to have a purpose: to defend America and its values. Our men and women in service sacrificed to protect their loved ones and to serve the greater good.  In present times Trump is deliberately encouraging civilians to die ostensibly in support of his cause.  The Twitter thread from this past weekend from Senator Chris Murphy explains it very well:  ======= Start of Thread From Senator Chris Murphy via Twitter  Can we take the gloves off and tell the truth?  Trump is deliberately killing people.  He holds rallies where people get infected. On Thursday no social distancing or masks sending a clear message that the CDC should be ignored.  His plan is to kill people. Let's just say it.  I know what I wrote [above] sounds harsh. But I stand by it and I want to explain why.  1/ From the start of the epidemic Trump has mostly refused to wear a mask and engage in social distancing. He often does this very publicly and brazenly (like in Oklahoma City).  2/ His RNC speech was his biggest stage. 23m watched.  The question is - WHY did Trump choose not to socially distance guests or require them to wear masks as his own CDC guidelines below recommend?  There seems to be no good reason. He easily could have.  3/ He and his advisors KNEW the consequences of brazenly thumbing their nose at their own CDC.  They know viewers follow his example and thus it will now be impossible to convince many people social distancing/masks are important. Bc Trump has made it crystal clear they AREN'T.  4/ And they KNOW that masks/social distancing have proven to save lives (see the NIH Director below).  So for no good reason they chose a path that will make it harder to beat COVID and would lead to more people dying. They made this choice consciously.  5/ Think of it this way - say you told your wife you're going to drive to the grocery store and on the way ignore all the stoplights.  You don't have a good reason - you just want to get to the store faster. She tells you before you leave that you're going to get people killed.  6/ But you do it anyway and you run over people.  You had no good reason to be reckless. You knew the consequences beforehand and did it anyway.  You'd be rightly called a killer.  The difference btwn you and Trump is that you killed 3 or 4. Trump's actions killed thousands.  ======= End of Thread From Senator Chris Murphy via Twitter  184000+ have now died from COVID-19 in the United States and that number will assuredly increase substantially. On the surface it seems rather senseless and it is hard to see how anyone benefits from it. But let's look deeper.  When a cult-leader takes glory in requiring his followers to risk perishing senselessly on his behalf and when cult members are quite vocal in defending their freedom to infect and kill others it is a death cult.  It is tempting to make a joke about it as Darwinism in action. Some of them like Herman Cain will be gone and the pandemic will likely impact Trump's base harder than others.  But the willingness to potentially sacrifice themselves and the willingness to inflict senseless death upon others becomes a bond that actually brings them closer together. It proves their loyalty to the cult (most specifically the cult leader) is greater than their sense of right or wrong or even of reason. It is how a cult leader gets people to drink poisoned Kool-Aid. (If using the term ""cult"" makes you uncomfortable you might find the mafia syndicate analogy more apt. He is putting them through a right of passage that binds them as soldatos in his Cosa Nostra with Trump of course as The Don.)  It also seems right out of the Twilight Zone that once America's men (and women) in uniform like my father served in the armed services (and in some cases died) to oppose fascism during World War II while Trump's supporters today appear to be willing to sacrifice their lives in support of bringing fascism to America. It feels prima facie treasonous.  Fascist Germany was a death cult too and Trump is using the pandemic as an opportunity to apply the same general template to America. Think about the Nazis who participated in the mass murder of millions in Germany in the 1930s and 1940s. The people who committed those horrific acts in most cases started out as decent and moral members of German society just like your Trump-supporting neighbors once were decent and moral members of American society. But under the culture of fascist Germany led by a genocidal authoritarian the normal societal safeguards that prevent such atrocities were removed. Behaviors that had once been considered unacceptable or even insane for a single individual to engage in became ""accepted"" when conducted en masse by many thousands of people who were bound together by their willingness to commit horrific acts and by their allegiance to their cult leader. During the final weeks of the Third Reich and the war in Europe many civilians government officials and military personnel throughout Germany also committed suicide. In addition to high-ranking Nazi officials like Adolf Hitler Joseph Goebbels Heinrich Himmler Philipp Bouhler and Martin Bormann many others chose Selbstmord (German for ""suicide"" literally ""Self-murder"") (Ref: Wikipedia).  Trump couldn't care one way or another if his followers live or die as individuals. To him they are all marks. But he thrives on their willingness to die for him and to kill for him. The loss of support he might incur because of some thinning of the herd is far less important to him than the value and cohesiveness he gets from bonding the group together to support him in a manner that goes beyond rationality to become something more akin to idolization or worship.  Watching these individuals self-sacrifice would be bad enough if it would only end there. There is a price to be paid for an exceptional degree of stupidity and gullibility. But when these cult warriors get infected they in turn risk the lives of health care workers and many others who provide essential services to them. And they infect their children and their children will then infect the children of others along with their teachers. Consider a 60+ year-old school teacher with asthma who is told (by her governor and her school district following direction from Trump) that she has no choice but to either go to work in a classroom and then incur a high likelihood of COVID-19 infection and then a subsequent high likelihood of an adverse outcome (death) from the infection... or she can resign her job and lose her income and her ability to pay her bills. It isn't the kind of choice that any human being should ever have to make.  Crime analyst Jeff Asher looked at US crime trends in 2020 and found murders are up 26 percent trending up in 19 of 25 cities included in his analysis (and reported by Vox). Under Trump's watch hate crimes in the US reached a 16 year high in 2018 (the last year in which comprehensive statistics have been released) according to the US Department of Justice. The apparent increased volume of hate crime reports in the recent news implies a strong likelihood they have continued to escalate further since then. Once individuals cross a line into a willingness to senselessly kill others for the cult leader they won't hesitate to do other dreadful things like destroy ballots take to the streets to incite violence with peaceful protesters and engage in a wide variety of other wrongful acts designed to create chaos that ""only he can fix.""  But the reality is that the only ones who can fix it are you and I this November.  The alternative is simply too dreadful to abide.",political,Facebook
Trump in North Carolina today told his voters to both vote by mail in ballot AND to vote at the polls because if your not supposed to vote twice they will catch it.  In case you didnt get that the President is telling his voters to commit fraud. Which is a crime. And its a felony. But I digress.,political,Facebook
"RANDOM PSYCHOLOGY 85 B This had to a bit all over the place for a reason.  We like to play we like to be involved we like to think we know things we like to think we are doing something. And that is bad really bad. It is bad because we don't have enough knowledge and commonsense to know right from wrong so we just follow along whatever seems interesting whatever catches our attention at the moment and we are in damn the torpedoes. Back in the seventies and eighties it was the bowling and baseball leagues. Now with the cable TV and now with the internet it has changed a lot but! One of the problems with "" thou shalt not judge"" is that we can get involved and do things that would have been considered a taboo a few years ago and then brag about them to all the world. We have mainstreamed BDSM or so we talk about it as nothing people with young daughters talk about anal sex on their #Facebook page whatever else. But we also expect others to be moral and righteous at the same time. We talk about rights but only for our own selves. We talk about the sleaze and the corruption but only if the other party or people. When we talk about the blacks acting out we don't talk about ourselves calling the police on our neighbors when we talk about the low education blacks not dressing properly we don't talk about the four hundred pound whites wearing pajamas in public and so on. If the minorities are rioting they are bad but if the whites are trashing the neighborhood it is okay. How much do we notice and what we decide to ignore. And we sexualize our preteen sons and daughters and then we talk about stalkers and moles6after we have prepared our kids for sex of all kinds and we call it experimenting and many of us never get out of our ""experimenting"" phase either. Even sex has become a political issue #saveourkids .  The democrats had 8 years to make their move and present their case to the people not the defense contractors not the Big banks not the international community to the #American people they had a chance to promote job training education and family they failed you can read my complaints at my old blog I don't take sides in this. Obama failed even to promote human rights he failed to stop wars. In Yemen in Libya in Syria we created wars. In China in India in Israel in Burma we failed to protect the indigenous people. So no Democrats don't get a free ride. There was lot that could have been done to calm the minority populations we can not ignore the fact that part of the hate is created by the community being out of control #Trump is only taking advantage of the divisions that already existed only to get reelected and hopefully stay out of prison he doesn't care if the country goes to a civil war or burns to the ground. The #Constitition and the laws be dammed his followers will jump of a cliff behind him. That is not their politics that is their religion has nothing to do with the #Jesus the #Bible or #Christianity . You can read the #scriptures all day long to find any support for his agenda. That it is the fault of both sides that we have purposefully made ourselves ignorant if you read back my writings on society my commentary has been same for over thirty years. We have chosen to remain ignorant and the politicians and the media told us we were too rich and too smart to have a character. Two months ago I wrote that the Democrats have lost the moral superiority if we only protest when a black is murdered on camera but do nothing in between  we are not helping our cause. Where are the leaders political and religious asking for jobs programs asking for better schools better living conditions asking for more responsible behaviour from all sides. Police killings are the symptoms the disease runs deeper. I am for reparations but not in dollars in scholarships in jobs in infrastructure in addiction treatment in rehabilitation and such. Not more welfare without responsibility. And that is both for the blacks and the native American communities. In a civil war there are no young people no elderly and no innocent by standers. M. N.
