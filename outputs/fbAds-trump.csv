"During the Civil War President Abraham Lincoln encouraged a return ""... to the better angels of our nature."" Once again we find the nation in need of a return to ""better""; this would be a means to that end! DA2020  Opinion  This Should Be Bidens Bumper Sticker:  ""RESPECT SCIENCE RESPECT NATURE RESPECT EACH OTHER""  He will need a simple clear message to counter Trumps Make America Great Again trope.  Thomas L. Friedman By Thomas L. Friedman Opinion Columnist The New York Times  June 30 2020  I almost  but not quite  feel sorry for Donald Trump. Hes with two invisible enemies at once  the coronavirus and Joe Biden  and both remain highly elusive the pathogen by nature and the politician by design.  Biden who made a rare public appearance on Tuesday has been wise to stay out of sight. Trump is now in a full-on race to the bottom with himself pushing uglier and uglier positions that appeal to smaller and smaller segments of the American public. Why get in his way?  Of course eventually Biden will debate the incumbent and will need a simple clear message to counter Trumps tired Make America Great Again trope.  I have an idea for Bidens bumper sticker.  As I think about what kind of president Biden wants to be and what kind of president America needs him to be the slogan that comes to mind was suggested to me by the environmental innovator Hal Harvey. Harvey didnt know he was suggesting it; he just happened to sign off a recent email to me by writing: Respect science respect nature respect each other.  I thought  wow thats a perfect message for Biden and for all of us. It summarizes so simply the most important values Americans feel that weve lost in recent years and hope to regain from a post-Trump presidency.  Biden should highlight his commitment to all three values in every speech and interview he gives. They draw such a clear simple and easy to remember contrast with Trump.  Start with respecting science. Trumps obvious disdain for truth-telling is annoying when he exaggerates his crowd sizes his hand sizes the size of his bank account or the size of his election victory.  But his disdain for science has become fatal as were seeing in this widening pandemic. Trump has gone from offering quack remedies like disinfectant ultraviolet light and hydroxychloroquine to mocking people including Biden for adopting the easiest and most scientifically proven method for limiting the spread of the coronavirus: wearing a face mask.  The pro-Trump governor of Arizona where the virus is now spiraling out of control at one point actually barred local officials from mandating that residents wear masks. Thats as crazy as when Trump declared If we stop testing right now wed have very few cases if any.  Think about that: Stop testing. Then well have no knowledge. Then well have no numbers. Then well have no virus. Why didnt I think of that?  Stop testing people for drunken driving and then well have no more drunken drivers. Stop arresting people for shootings and then the crime rate will go down.  Attention fellow Americans this impugning of scientific methods this embrace of conspiracy theories this undermining of truth and data by our president and vice president  this is not happening in other countries. This is not happening in Germany France China South Korea Denmark Canada Israel or Japan. This is a form of American exceptionalism that we never imagined possible.  Were not leading. Were not following. Were lost.  This is Dark Ages stuff remarked Harvey founder of Energy Innovation. A prime difference between the Enlightenment and the Dark Ages is respect for knowledge respect for science. The whole idea of progress requires objectively looking at problems finding and testing solutions and then spreading and using the best of them. Thats how we grow thats how we learn thats how we prosper.  Indeed it is amazing to think that in the year 2020 Biden could actually run for president with an ad that says: I believe in the Enlightenment Newtonian physics and the Age of Reason. The other guy doesnt.  As for respecting nature that has two meanings. The first is to respect the power of nature which Trump has utterly failed to do. She doesnt negotiate. You cannot seduce her or sue her. She does whatever chemistry biology and physics dictate. Full stop. Which means in a pandemic that she will just keep infecting people  relentlessly mercilessly silently and exponentially  until she runs out of people to infect or a vaccine or exposure makes enough of us immune. She also doesnt keep score. Shell make you sick and then blow down your house with a tornado.  Trumps lack of respect for nature may be a political asset for him with his base but its been a disaster for the country. He has built no coordinated national strategy against a virus that demands coordination  because the virus evolved to exploit any cracks in your personal or communal immune system and it pays no heed to the Oklahoma-Texas borderline.  Respect for nature also means understanding that we live on a hard rock called planet Earth with a thin cover of oceans and topsoil enveloped by a thin layer of atmosphere. Abuse that soil junk up those oceans with plastics distort that atmospheric blanket and we will likely (further) destroy the perfect Garden of Eden that has been the basis of all human civilization.  And remember as bad as this pandemic is its just training wheels for the big irreversible atmospheric pandemic: climate change.  The latest evidence? See National Geographic online: An extended heat wave that has been baking the Russian Arctic for months drove the temperature in Verkhoyansk Russia  north of the Arctic Circle  to 100.4 degrees F on June 20 the official first day of summer in the Northern Hemisphere. Thats 100 degrees in the Arctic!  Respect each other? Thats not so easy in the midst of our other pandemic  a pandemic of incivility. You cannot exaggerate the impact on the whole civic culture of having a president who has elevated name-calling denigration and lying to a central feature of his presidency amplified by the White House.  We have social networks whose business model is to elevate and spread the most enraged voices from the far right and the far left and generally bring out the worst in people. Almost every day now some public figure or just everyday American has to apologize for some inane or hurtful tweet.  But this pandemic of incivility is fed by many sources. We have white police officers who feel such a sense of impunity that one of them kept his knee on a Black mans neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds while people were recording him on their phones.  We have a level of inequality that is so endemic that your ZIP code is now a better predictor of life expectancy than your genetic code. Respecting each other means ensuring each others equal access to the American dream  and right now Black Hispanic and white Americans are climbing very different housing education and health care ladders which simply has to be fixed.  And we have a mad gun culture that has way too many young men thinking respect can come from the barrel of a gun. Minneapolis has witnessed over 100 people shot since the death of George Floyd on May 25  a lot of it gang-related.  We have so many important issues to discuss among ourselves right now but for that discussion to be productive we cant just go from justifiable outrage straight to firings public shamings or disbanding police departments  without pausing for respectful dialogue and moral distinctions.  I dont know what is sufficient to get more people respecting one another but I know two things that are necessary. One is a president who every day models respect rather than denigration. Thats Bidens job.  The other is getting people out of Facebook and into each others faces again  not to shout or denounce but to listen. Its important what you learn when you listen. Its even more important what you say when you listen. Listening is a sign of respect. And it is amazing what people will let you say to them if they first think that you respect them. Thats our job.  Respect science respect nature respect each other. Biden 2020.  Its the only way to make America great again.  The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Voter suppression is not a democratic endeavor!  Unfortunately GOP controlled states are trying or have passed new laws to that end since the 2020 election.  So the Senate's minority rule feature the fillbuster must be swept from the high chamber to restore simple majority voting to allow passage of this legislation.  The right-wingers will say that they are protecting the vote. NO! What they seek in essence is to restrict voting rights by making voting unnecessarily difficult.  By this design they intend to retain power contrary to democratic principles. DA2020s (Share if you agree!)  //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////  Trumps false narrative about election fraud has prompted lawmakers in 43 states to file bills to limit ballot access.  US voting rights  Landmark US bill to stop voter suppression passes first hurdle in House Voting legislation which also targets gerrymandering and campaign finance needs 60 votes in Senate to become law  Associated Press  Thu 4 Mar 2021 01.18 EST  House Democrats have passed sweeping voting and ethics legislation over unanimous Republican opposition advancing to the Senate what would be the largest overhaul of the US election law in at least a generation.  House Resolution 1 which touches on virtually every aspect of the electoral process was approved 220-210. It would restrict partisan gerrymandering of congressional districts strike down hurdles to voting and bring transparency to a murky campaign finance system that allows wealthy donors to anonymously bankroll political causes.  The bill would be one of the largest expansions of the right to vote in America since the passage of the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act. It requires states to offer early voting as well as same-day automatic and online voter registration. It mandates that states allow anyone to vote by mail if they wish (16 states currently require an excuse) and would impose new limits on how states can remove people from the voter rolls also sometimes referred to as voter purging.  The bill also would limit the manipulation of the physical boundaries electoral districts for partisan gain or gerrymandering a process Republicans used at unprecedented levels a decade ago. States would have to follow fairness criteria when drawing districts require states to set up independent commissions to the lines.  The right to vote is sacred and fundamental  it is the right from which all of our other rights as Americans spring. This landmark legislation is urgently needed to protect that right to safeguard the integrity of our elections and to repair and strengthen our democracy Joe Biden said in a statement on Thursday morning.  The bill is a powerful counterweight to voting rights restrictions advancing in Republican-controlled statehouses across the country in the wake of Donald Trumps repeated false claims of a stolen 2020 election. Yet it faces an uncertain fate in the Democratic-controlled Senate where it has little chance of passing without changes to procedural rules that now allow Republicans to block it.  That rule the filibuster requires 60 votes for legislation to advance. Because Democrats are unlikely to find 10 Republican senators to sign on to the bill there are loud calls to get rid of the rule. But not all Democrats in the senate support ending the filibuster. The fight over whether to keep the rule looms as a major one for the Democrats in the senate; calls to eliminate the filibuster have only grown louder with the sweeping voting restrictions Republicans are passing across the country.  The stakes in the outcome are huge cutting to the foundational idea that one person equals one vote and carrying with it the potential to shape election outcomes for years to come. It also offers a test of how hard President Joe Biden and his party are willing to fight for their priorities as well as those of their voters.  US House passes most ambitious police reform effort in decades This bill will put a stop at the voter suppression that were seeing debated right now said Nikema Williams a new congresswoman who represents the Georgia district that deceased voting rights champion John Lewis held for years. This bill is the Good Trouble he fought for his entire life.  To Republicans however it would give license to unwanted federal interference in states authority to conduct their own elections  ultimately benefiting Democrats through higher turnout most notably among minorities.  Democrats want to use their razor-thin majority not to pass bills to earn voters trust but to ensure they dont lose more seats in the next election House minority leader Kevin McCarthy said from the House floor on Tuesday.  The measure has been a priority for Democrats since they won their House majority in 2018. But it has taken on added urgency in the wake of Trumps false claims which incited the deadly storming of the US Capitol in January.  Courts and even Trumps last attorney general William Barr found his claims about the election to be without merit. But spurred on by those lies state lawmakers across the US have filed more than 200 bills in 43 states that would limit ballot access according to a tally kept by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University.  Trump's fraud claims undermine democracy ex-US election security chief says In Iowa the legislature voted to cut absentee and in-person early voting while preventing local elections officials from setting up additional locations to make early voting easier. In Georgia the House on Monday voted for legislation requiring identification to vote by mail that would also allow counties to cancel early in-person voting on Sundays when many Black voters cast ballots after church.  On Tuesday the supreme court appeared ready to uphold voting restrictions in Arizona which could make it harder to challenge state election laws in the future.  When asked why proponents sought to uphold the Arizona laws which limit who can turn in absentee ballots and enable ballots to be thrown out if they are cast in the wrong precinct a lawyer for the states Republican party said: Because it puts us at a competitive disadvantage relative to Democrats said attorney Michael Carvin.

"""The Psychology of Trump-Haters""  Whats happening in America right now shouldnt come as a surprise to anyone. It could be spotted from miles away!  As a psychologist watching the political back and forth in the USA over the past 5 years is pretty incredible. Seeing people say what theyve said behaved in the way theyve behaved and made the decisions theyve made has been interesting to watch. Its also illuminated a very clear truth.  The reason why Trump-haters hate Trump so much is not because they actually hate Trump the person. Because they dont even know him. Theyre definitely not protesting Trumps competence or political policies. Because well lets face it he did an incredible job with our economy protected the people inside the country with strong borders and won the respect of so many around the world. Allies felt supported. Enemies knew not to mess. Prospects knew to tread carefully. And he did it all so confidently unabashedly unapologetically. How attractive!  So the question remains if its not his personality and its not his policies what is it? Notice that people who have been critical of Trump tend to be very reactionary in their position. Its a highly emotional topic for them. It stirs up a lot. Interestingly the reaction has been so powerful and pervasive that it even has its own syndrome!  And therein lies the answer to this question. The people who have been so vehemently opposed to Trump are not really against Trump. Theyre upset at what Trump triggers deep inside them. That is what they're reacting to when they hear ""Trump."" Trump reminds many of the unprocessed anger they have towards authority figures in their lives. Maybe an angry father. Perhaps a controlling mother. Possibly an abusive boss. For many people the idea of Trump has woken (no pun intended) up tremendous emotional pain and psychological trauma that these people have not dealt with. And that they have not wanted to deal with.  Psychologically-speaking thats how we got here. Thats why so many picked Biden. I put it in quotes because they didnt really pick Biden. They just wanted to escape Trump. Or I should say the painful memories that Trump stirred up inside them. Was Trump opinionated? Of course he was. Was he outlandish in his delivery at times? Absolutely. Did he come across as arrogant and egotistical at points? Without question. Its all true!!!  But objectively that is what you want in a President of the USA. That is what you want from your Commander in Chief. That is what you want from the guy whos sole responsibility and duty is to go up to bat for you. You want someone who will unabashedly stand up for you guard you and protect your interests with everything hes got when it comes down to the wire.  The truth is to guard and protect properly sometimes you have to be bold. You have be direct. You have to be aggressive. Otherwise some wont hear you. They will not respect you. They will manipulate you. And they will walk all over you.  To the Trump haters I feel for you. Living this way must be complete emotional hell. Because youre always on the run. Your life is driven by fear. You make decisions that are based in anxiety and avoidance. Youre constantly looking to make choices not that you necessarily personally believe in but because they are less triggering. And unfortunately sometimes it leads to this. The truth about Biden is clear to everyone now. At least it should be. He was never fit to be a leader in this capacity. The writing was on the wall from the very beginning. Some decided to see it. Others were too scared to. Because it stirred up too much. Its okay. You didnt know.  Hopefully this incident can be used as an opportunity for you to exercise the courage to look inside and see what your triggers in life actually are. Consider. Who talked down to you growing up? Who hurt you? Who made you feel so little ? Pay attention to it. Process it. Address it.  You will see better. Decide better. And live better.",political,Facebook
"AN AMERICAN NATIONALIST VOTING INDEX Draining the Swamp  ""Behind the ostensible government sits enthroned an invisible government owing no allegiance and acknowledging no responsibility to the people. To destroy this invisible government to befoul the unholy alliance between corrupt business and corrupt politics is the first task of the statesmanship of the day."" Theodore Roosevelt  This is a part of a series examining the issues in the presidential election. To see other articles in the series visit the website below and click on the 2020 Elections link on the Home page.  Score  Biden 0 Trump -1  Trumps victory in 2016 was powered by a call to drain the swamp in Washington which never consisted simply of campaign reform. It sought to end the kind of cancer described by Roosevelt  the control of government by a privileged few that subverts the very nature of democracy itself. We also now know it means different things to different groups. In this campaign the call for reform has focused on not just campaign reform but also on federal administrative and policing changes.  Campaign Finance Reform  The Citizens United decision and our loophole-riddle campaign finance laws have loosed a flood of money whose origins are opaque and very probably illegal. Democrats introduced a bill that would plug some of those loopholes. It attempts to limit the impact of Citizens United by requiring disclosure of donations of more than $10000 from certain non-profits that were previously exempt. It cracks down on digital ad spending on social media platforms by requiring the same kind of disclosure of the source of ads required for television and radio commercials. The bill also attempts to limit the use of social media for the kind of election interference we saw from the Russians in 2016 by banning campaign contributions from corporations with significant foreign ownership. Finally it also prevents foreign individuals from purchasing social media ads. Former Vice President Biden has endorsed these proposals and President Trump opposes them. This earns Biden a +1 and Trump a -1.  However there is a sleeper issue in campaign finance that has been ignored by both candidates. If you are like me your e-mail box has been deluged by appeals for campaign contributions from any number of candidates and partisan political action committees. They seek contributions of as little as five dollars by simple completion of a form on the Internet and a charge via PayPal or by credit card. While the identity of the donors must be disclosed there are no rules requiring the verification of their identities. A former Kansas attorney general recently issued an analysis of the contributions to the ActBlue independent committees which raised over $900 million for Democratic candidates. It showed how ActBlue has gamed the campaign finance system so that the true sources of their contributions is almost impossible to determine. This makes it easy for large donors to break up their contributions or foreign donors to hide theirs If Biden or President Trump are really interested in controlling dark money this loophole must be plugged as well.  Federal Administrative Law Reform  The failure of Congress to address a pressing issue has now become an excuse for forcing action through administrative rulemakings. As I mentioned in my post on the US Supreme Courts s opinion on the DACA rulemaking current law makes it difficult to control an executive agencys impulse to fill this perceived gap. This essentially creates a fourth branch of government whose inner workings are known and accessible to only a few.  Federal executive power needs to be reined in through new legislation that (1) Limits agency rulemaking to discrete subjects narrowly delegated to the agency; (2) Prohibit agency action if its impact on the economy or the number of people affected exceeds certain thresholds; (3) Allows more opportunity to challenge a agency ruling and repeal it. The DACA and Clean Power Plan rules of the Obama Administration show that Vice President Biden is a likely opponent of such reforms. Meanwhile Trump has relied on and touted his executive order power instead of pursuing legislation to prevent a future president from abusing these powers. President Bidens implied approval of current agency power results in a -1 for him on this issue while Trump deserves only a 0.  Law Enforcement Reform  The death of George Floyd and other African-Americans at the hands of the police and the FBI abuses of the FISA warrant system revealed in the Russia investigation has highlighted another swamp that needs to be drained  the excessive and unchecked power of law enforcement. As mentioned in this post policing reforms must be based not only reducing qualified immunity and other changes in tactics but also a top-to-bottom review of our law enforcement strategy.  Former Vice President Biden supports proposals to reform police tactics but never mentions the need for increased funding for the police necessary to do their job of maintaining order in our communities. The Obama Administrations acquiescence at the least and encouragement at worst of the FBIs FISA abuses does not inspire any confidence that he would support reform in this area. These two positions cancel each other out and earn him a zero on this subject. While the Trump Administration is vigorously pursuing the FBI abuses via the John Durham investigation the President has ignored and at times demagogued the police brutality issue Again the two positions cancel each other out and thus he also deserves only a zero  Conclusion  It is truly discouraging that neither candidate has Roosevelts level of concern about the perilous state of American democracy and civil rights. Trumps failures are particularly galling since his 2016 campaign featured the issue. It is up to American nationalists to press these issues with congressional candidates and in future elections.

"Copyright  2020 ABC News Internet Ventures.  POLICE USED TEAR GAS PUSHED BACK PEACEFUL PROTESTERS FOR TRUMP CHIURCH VISIT!  ....  By Ben Gittleson &Jordyn Phelps  June 1 2020  ...  Police reinforced by National Guard troops forcefully pushed back protesters outside the White House Monday evening to clear a way for President Donald Trump to visit a church just minutes after he said he wanted a military show of force against violent protests gripping the country.  As television cameras showed live images of Trump's quick stop at the historic St. John's Church where a small fire caused damage to its basement during protests the night before the president posed with a Bible and with senior members of administration. Moments before police had cleared largely peaceful demonstrators from the area using tear gas and beating some with batons and shields including at least one news photographer. The dramatic escalation 15 minutes before a nighttime curfew was due to go into effect came soon after D.C. National Guard troops were deployed near the White House.

We have gone from Mary Tyler Moore and Jungle Jim and the Wagon Train to Jerry Springer the Jersey Shores to Big Brother and Pregnant whatever (I really don't know). And Besides the shows that talk about murders glorify the police and the military don't you think we are being misdirected on purpose and we follow along as sheep. Our leaders have gone from the FDR and Eisenhower and Kennedy to Newt Gingrich Clinton and Trump but we all claim that we are smart enough and knowledgeable. Please back up and regroup. Let me state here before we go further first go back and read as much of this series as you can handle secondly if you are 50ish and on your 3rd  2d or 4th plus marriage you have no business giving relationship advice and if you are same age group and on your 1st or second marriage still you are both financially and mentally better off than average.  Let me say this again and I will probably repeat myself I am NOT religious I am not moral I am in no way claiming piety or non worldlyness I am not passing a moral judgment  my only desire is to make you aware that the game is being played you are being enslaved and that you need to educate yourself about it.  RANDOM PSYCHOLOGY 35 B  I am not bashing anyone and I am not judging anyone if you are happy with your lot in life it is your life.

I know this much that that if things did always work out the way you wanted  that all that you wished for came true then you either learned something early on or had to change the way you were living.  At the risk of repeating myself let me repeat myself here are a few observations on life that I have had over the years. Some items removed because FB standards There is a cost to being stupid the cost of being stupid can be measured in real dollars and cents. There is more I will quote later  The problem is not that our society the education system the politicians the preachers the psychologists the parents the media or the industrialists kept us ignorant the problem is that we have accepted our lot and we stubbornly refuse to learn anything that will fix our ways and our lives and that is what really makes me upset. We all know that the owners kept the slaves uneducated to control them the slaves were punished for even trying to learn to read unfortunately we have decided to to make illiteracy our own lot. I for one believe that if you refuse to learn refuse to change your ways you deserve the extreme punishment you can get.  M. N. R. 14 SEPTEMBER 2019,political,Facebook
"What are our top goals if and when we get the support we need?  Our top goal is to transform America into an empire of liberty ruled by the People according to a Bill of Rights standard through local freedom shire communities where the original spirit and intent of the US Bill of Rights is the standard. We don't just want to resist the corpomarxists we want to defeat their entire culture and economic stranglehold and replace it with the rule of a free people who can and will achieve universal prosperity.  Of course we will focus on winning elections re-electing President Trump and defeating the neomarxist party of the corpostate everywhere we can. But we have other goals as well which run deeper than winning national elections though we can never leave off that effort.  To facilitate this The American Freedomist Network will provide a safe and secure digital space with news and resources forums and groups and ways for members to interact and share content and ideas as well as organized and meet in person.  Our core long-term goals:  1. The creation of a digital-to-local activist army who will show up online and on the street to expose confront and defeat the freedom takers called The Freedomist Guard America's Spiritual Air Force  They say we conservatives don't protest because we work. The truth is more complicated than that. The left's donors and financial backers support their activists our side doesn't. We want to change that directly. There are many people who if they could gain support would work to organize groups of people for activities.  The Freedomist Guard organized as Flights Squadrons Wings and Groups will conduct peaceful digital and local actions to promote liberty to confront freedom takers and to visually attract Americans to our cause.  (The Freedomist Guard will be a peaceful un-armed spiritual air force this isn't any kind of militia.)  We do envision Color Guard Units of the Freedomist Guard participating in local parades or leading peaceful demonstrations to show the flag and visually represent our Movement.  2. The creation of a national network of local free press operations run by trained citizen journalists using the RAWE News model a model that is proven to gain and attract a loyal following and a paywall model so local free press teams can earn a living  Journalism shouldn't be limited to brainwashed writers whose real agenda is neomarxist radicalism. We need a new kind of journalism driven by loyalty to the Bill of Rights and a desire to give local people what they want: Resources Advocacy (for themselves not the journalist) and Watchdog coverage of fraud and the such all presented in and Entertaining and Educational manner.  We want to create a national digital infrastructure so people can easily set up local free press operations and a paywall so that they can make a living. We will also provide training and support as well as legal protection against litigation or violations of their first amendment rights.  3. Freedomist clubs for mutual support preparation for disasters self-reliance and social activities  We envision a national network of local Freedomist Clubs that are like lodges and thaf focus on concrete and practical ways for members to be more free and independent while being prepared for disasters. These clubs would have social activities as well.  Local groups can use the American Freedomist Network to gather online and organize and then need only get certified as being compliant with our standards to become the recognized local Freedomist Clubs to which all local members of the AFN will be referred.  4. Freedomist Town Meetings would focus on getting local voters to sign a Pledge of Allegiance to the Bill of Rights they would mirror and engage local officials they would elect and instruct Delegates to local gocerning bodies and they would get local officials and people who hold a public trust to pledge allegiance to the Bill of Rights  The goal here is for communities to become ""freedom shires"" where all or most all local officials and people who hold a public trust adhere to and uphold the Bill of Rights. These Town Meetings would create a whole local culture around the Bill of Rights on their original spirit and intent. As the number of freedom shires grows the power of the corpomarxists would decrease in this land.  This will emerge into regional Freedomist Caucuses State Freedomist Congresses and a National Freedomist Congress with Delegates assigned to real world contemporary officials assisted by Consituent Committees of 5-10 people.  As noted our aim is to create an online network for Freedomists who pledge allegiance to the Bill of Rights to America's spritual constitution based on our UPDR Ideals and the principles of a freedom economy founded upon the only derfect democracy which is Capitalism.  Freedomists believe that these three things are the core elements for restoring the USA to the status of an empire of liberty a free Commonwealth consisting of free and sovereign United People's Democratic Republics (states) and nations of people with their own sociocultural and economic independence but who are compatible with the ways of a pluralistic and free society.  Our goal is to win as many Americans over as possible to become Freedomists!  America has not yet fulfilled our empire of liberty goal as described by Thomas Jefferson along with his local Ward Republic ideas but we believe it CAN fulfill this goal. Qe envision America as an empire of liberty driven mostly by the prevalence of local freedom shire communities where the People truly rule according to a Bill of Rights standard.  Do you want an America like this where everyone can be free and where prosperity is universal? We believe that through the Bill of Rights the UPDR Ideals and Capitalism we can build sufh an empire of liberty one person and one community at a time.",political,Facebook
Liz Cheney is possibly the bravest politician in America. She is sacrificing her powerful leadership position to stand up for what is right in denouncing the Big Lie that Trump really won the election. The fact that 70% of the voters in her party believe that lie makes it obvious her party no longer stands for the same values as she does. It is time politicians in the middle separate from the Republicans and Democrats to form a centrist party. Mitt Romney Joe Manchin and many more elected officials could create a strong third party. To the naysayers that say a third party can never make it I have a history lesson for you. In 1860 the US elected a president from a third party founded just 6 years earlier.

But If you agree that it is important to share to make Americans aware we trust that you will. DA 2020  MARCH 2018  465.  March 1 2018  The FBI announced it was investigating a Russian oligarch Alexander Torshin for funneling money through the National Rifle Association to Donald Trumps campaign. Torshin who is the deputy governor of the Bank of Russia carries close interpersonal ties to the Kremlin.  466.  March 2 2018  William G. Otis Donald Trumps appointee for the Sentencing Commission which sets policy for punishing federal prisoners has favored abolishing the agency. Otis has also written a variety of racially charged statements on subjects ranging from violence to family structure. In one post on the legal blog Crime and Consequences Trumps new pick for the commission wrote When Fifth Circuit Judge Edith Jones said at a University of Pennsylvania Law School talk that blacks and Hispanics are more violent than whites a consortium of civil rights organizations filed a complaint. The complaint calls for stern discipline on the grounds that the remarks were discriminatory and biased. So far as I have been able to discover it makes no mention of the fact that theyre true.  467.  March 3 2018  Ignoring advice from his economic advisors Donald Trump chose to create steep tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. White House officials said Trumps decision which could result in a trade war was spur-of-the-momentmade without a strategy to alert trade partners without a legislative plan submitted to Congress and without any scheduled remarks beyond an email from the Commerce department drafted late at night on February 28th.  468.  March 3 2018  After Chinese President Xi Jinping altered the Chinese constitution to abolish his term limitsallowing him to retain power indefinitelyDonald Trump was recorded in a closed-door meeting as he said [Xis] now president for life. President for life I think its great. Maybe well have to give that a shot someday.  469.  March 4 2018  With midterm elections approaching the State Department was issued $120 million to combat election meddling from Russia; as of March 2018 they hadnt spent any of it.  470.  March 5 2018  In a move that may violate federal law the Trump Organization ordered new tee markers bearing the official presidential seal for one of their international golf courses. The law in question states the presidential seal or any facsimile thereof may not be used for any commercial purpose.  471.  As of March 2018  Donald Trump and Republicans in the House and the Senate used the Congressional Review Act with an unprecedented frequency. The act allowed the House to remove any regulation within 60 days of its enactment and has been the administrations weapon of choice in rolling back Obama-era regulations. Before Trump The Congressional Review Act had been used only one time; since Trump took office it has been exercised 15 times with dozens more rules proposed for removal.  472.  March 5 2018  The Trump administration announced it would allow hunters to import sport-hunted African elephant trophies on an application-by-application basis. The controversial hunting practice had been outlawed during the Obama administration. The U.S. Forest and Wildlife Service justified the decision by saying that findings on endangered species were no longer effective for making individual permit determinations for imports of sport-hunted African elephant trophies. The findings referenced as no longer effective were published just the year before.  473.  March 6 2018  The US Office Special Counsel announced Kellyanne Conway twice violated the Hatch Act a regulation which prohibits federal employees from publicly endorsing or criticizing candidates running for high-level positions. Conway had been a vocal advocate for Roy Moore in Alabamas Senate race last year speaking on Moores behalf during two Fox News interviews last year.  474.  March 6 2018  Chief Economic Advisor Gary Cohn resigned from the Trump Administration. Though no explicit reason was given for Cohns departure Trump had ignored Cohns long-standing advice against raising steel and aluminum tariffs earlier in the week causing many to speculate this was the impetus for Cohns exit.  475.  March 7 2018  Trumps chief of the U.S. Forest Service Tony Tooke resigned after allegations of sexual misconduct. PBS had released conversations with 34 women from the Forest Service discussing a culture of discrimination and sexual harassment. After the documentary aired it appeared Tooke was among those accused of sexual misconduct. The chief resigned from his post in an email to the agency. Tookes appointment occurred in August 2017 at the direction of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue.  476.  March 7 2018  Donald Trumps son-in-law Jared Kushner met with Mexican President Enrique Pea Nieto without the current US Ambassador to Mexico Roberta Jacobson. Kushner had almost no experience in international diplomacy while Jacobson served the US Government for 31 years as one of the nations leading experts on Latin America. Columbia Universitys Christopher Sabatini told the New York Times The sending of the presidents son-in-law  someone with no experience in Mexican-U.S. relations  is another example of the de-professionalization and personalization of diplomacy that will hurt U.S. interests and leverage in the region.  477.  March 7 2018  During questioning former Communications Director Hope Hicks revealed that two of her email accounts had been hacked and she still could not access either account. One of the hacked email addresses served as her primary contact while campaigning for Trump and the other was a personal address. Both the identity of the hackers and the sensitivity of the compromised information remained unknown.  478.  March 8 2018  The AP reported that one-third of the 59 people appointed to the EPA by President Trump have direct ties to fossil fuel companies either as registered lobbyists or as lawyers for chemical manufacturers.  479.  March 8 2018  The Interior Department planned to spend $139000 on six doors for Secretary Ryan Zinkes office.  480.  March 9 2018  EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt wanted to hold a series of public debates on whether or not climate change was real. Chief of Staff John Kelly deemed the debates unwise and told Pruitt to drop the idea according to White House officials. Those in the meeting with Kelly and Pruitt said Kelly considered the debates a distraction from the Trump administrations rollbacks of Obama-era legislation on climate change.  481.  March 10 2018  Donald Trump advocated for the execution of drug dealers as a means of addressing Americas drug problem. The previous year Trump was complimentary of Philippines President Rodrigo Dutertegoing so far as to invite him to the White Houseafter Duterte had been condemned by human rights groups for his extrajudicial killing of Filipino drug dealers.  482.  March 10 2018  Trump announced the US military would stage a military parade in Washington D.C. for veterans day in November 2018. After a trip to Paris for Bastille Day which included a French military parade Trump returned to the U.S. inspired to hold one himself. Criticism of the idea came from both sides of the aisle. At the very least it was considered a waste of resources as the parade will likely cost between $10 and $30 million.  483.  March 12 2018  House Republicans declared the Mueller investigation had failed to find any collusion between Donald Trump and the Russian. The statement released by the House Intelligence Committee was not reviewed by any of the Democrats on the committee before its publication. Rep. Adam Schiff one of the ranking Democrats on the committee tweeted BREAKING: GOP just shut down House Intel investigation leaving questions unanswered leads unexplored countless witnesses uncalled subpoenas unissued. If Russians have leverage over the President GOP has decided that it would rather not know. The minoritys work continues:  484.  March 12 2018  Department of Education head Betsy DeVos was interviewed on 60 Minutes and admitted she hadnt visited any underperforming schools and did not know basic public school statistics in her home state of Michigan.  485.  March 13 2018  Donald Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Trump had clashed with Tillerson in the past on everything from the Iran nuclear deal to issues of personal chemistry. In October it was rumored that Tillerson had called Trump a moron to senior staff members. To replace Tillerson Trump chose CIA Director Mike Pompeo who the president described as having a very similar thought process.  486.  March 20 2018  A citizen watchdog group named Public Citizen filed ethics complaints regarding significant conflicts of interest for 36 appointees in the Trump administration. These conflicts of interest in the administration violated Trumps own rules for ethical standards. In Executive Order 13770 Trump declared all federal appointees should pledge the following: If I was a registered lobbyist within the 2 years before the date of my appointment in addition to abiding by the limitations of paragraph 6 I will not for a period of 2 years after the date of my appointment participate in any particular matter on which I lobbied within the 2 years before the date of my appointment or participate in the specific issue area in which that particular matter falls. The Public Citizen attached a comprehensive report to each complaint which provided the full list of 36 individuals who were suspected to have violated Executive Order 13770. (  487.  March 22 2018  Donald Trump may have stoked a trade war with China by imposing tariffs on up to $60 billion worth of Chinese goods. While Chinas theft of American intellectual property has long struck economists as a serious problem in the economic relationship between the two world powers many economists viewed Trumps decision to impose tariffs on Chinese goods as a poor strategy for addressing the issue. Jason Furman an economist at Harvards Kennedy School of Government said Any good strategy has to include getting other countries on your side. If its the United States versus China were similar sized economies. If its the United States and the world versus China thats not something China can win.  488.  March 22 2018  Trump fired national security adviser General H.R. McMaster replacing him with former Fox News pundit John Bolton. McMaster and Trump had clashed frequently with McMaster telling Secretary of Defense James Mattis He treats me like a three-star rather than a coequal (McMaster is a four-star Marine Corps general). McMasters replacement John Bolton was in Trumps original consideration for the position but lost the spot because the president didnt like his mustache. The new hire would likely affect U.S. strategy for the upcoming diplomatic talks between the United States and North Korea as Bolton has long expressed hawkish views on North Korea. As recently as February 28 2018 Bolton wrote about the futility of conversation with North Korea favoring pre-emptive strike as the only viable option for the United States.  489.  March 25 2018  Ever since Trump was $1.6 billion in funding for his proposed border wall the president has privately argued for the construction funding to come from military budget. He then tweeted ""Because the $700 & $716 Billion gotten to rebuild our military many jobs are created and our military is again rich. Building a great border wall with drugs (poison) and enemy combatants pouring into our Country is all about national defense. Build WALL through M!  490.  March 26 2018  The Census Bureau announced it would include a question regarding citizenship status on the 2020 U.S. Census. The question hasnt been on the census since 1950. Critics of the move explained the question would discourage undocumented immigrants from responding to the census and thereby skew the population data significantly. The information gathered in the census has a bearing on everything from government policy to funding to boundaries for voting districts. Almost immediately the State of California sued the Trump administration over the constitutionality of the question. The Constitution states a census or actual enumeration must take place every 10 years and the enumeration must include the number of free persons. The State of California alleged this would include citizens and non-citizens alike.  491.  March 26 2018  Donald Trump kept in touch with Rob Porter after Porter left the White House amid credible allegations against him of domestic abuse from two of his ex-wives. In the final few weeks of March Trumps phone calls with Porter became increasingly frequent with some speculating Trump would bring Porter back to the White House soon. (March 25 2018)  492.  March 28 2018  The EPA sent an internal memo to staff describing a list of approved talking points downplaying the certainty of climate change. These included statements like ""While there has been extensive research and a host of published reports on climate change clear gaps remain in our understanding of the role of human activity and what we can do about it.

May 7 2019  The White House blocked former White House Counsel Don McGahn from disclosing records to the House Judiciary Committee. The documents contain information about Trump urging McGahn to fire Mueller. They also reference subsequent conversations in which the president told his former counsel to deny the exchanges.  601.  May 9 2019  At a rally in Florida Trump said How do you stop these people? when referring to migrants at the border. An audience member yelled Shoot them! The president then smirked and joked Only in the Panhandle!  602.  May 13 2019  Trump hosted Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbn at the White House. Orbns actions include installing a barbed-wire fence along the border to prevent impoverished migrants from the Middle East and Africa from entering the country. Trump said of the reactionary politician Viktor Orbn has done a tremendous job in so many different ways.  Probably like me a little bit controversial but thats OK.  And I know hes a tough man but hes a respected man. And hes done the right thing according to many people on immigration.  603.  May 15 2019  The Federal Register published safety rule changes that loosened an Obama-era restriction on offshore drilling. The safety regulation was enacted after the deadly 2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion in the Gulf of Mexico. The changes meant a savings of hundreds of millions of dollars for oil companies which donated large amounts of money to Trumps re-election campaign.  604.  May 20 2019  At a rally in Pennsylvania Trump repeated a claim that the United States has no more room for immigrants. Our country is full. We dont want people coming up here he said. His words contradicted what he said a month earlier: We have companies pouring in he said. The problem is we need workers.  605.  May 21 2019  The Department of Health and Human Services finalized a rule that allowed health workers to opt out of providing medical care if the procedure violates their conscience. Examples cites include abortion gender confirmation surgery and assisted suicide.  606.  May 24 2019  The Trump administration informed Congress that it would go ahead with $8 billion worth of arms sales to Saudi Arabia Jordan and the United Arab Emirates  despite congressional objections that it would lead to Saudis dropping bombs on civilians in Yemen.  607.  May 29 2019  Special Counsel Robert Mueller finished his report and then resigned from his investigative position transferring the responsibility of holding Trump accountable to Congress. If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime we would have said so Mueller said. We did not however make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime.  608.  May 30 2019  Trump threatened to impose a five percent tariff on all goods coming into the United States from Mexico  until such time as illegal migrants coming through Mexico and into our Country STOP.  609.  May 30 2019  The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services sent an email to federal migrant shelters notifying them that the government would not pay for educational and recreational programs for unaccompanied minors including English classes and legal aid.

"America is being destroyed ! No not by the Russians not even by the Chinese or Iranians who would love to see America destroyed. Many foreign enemies would want the decline and destruction of America. This time the barbarians of destruction are from within. The Chinese are investing trillions of dollars all around the globe and almost every country including those in Europe and taking over economically and with immigration while American democrats and lefties are bent on destroying America. China is building new ports new infrastructure and new cities in China and abroad and America is eliminating borders and legal immigration. America is arguing for males to compete in female athletics and gender neutral bathrooms. The whole world is dependent on China for almost all products including medicines that are vital. Never in history have people who have it so good and lived in complete freedom and equality and opportunity tried to destroy the closest country to a utopia. It is the era of America last for the Americans in power. Trump was the last president to put or tried to put America first. The country that is systemically racist has more blacks and brown people and foreign born wanting to come and live in it ! Everybody wants to come here and those who live here and who criticize and hate this country won't leave ! More jews  more muslims more Asians more Latinos and more Europeans want to come here than any other place in the world. Even more Chinese and Russians and Iranians would come here if they could. The socialist democrats here are tearing the country apart from within. They attack the police border control agents small businesses white people the hard working religion traditional families traditions legal immigrants who respect the process and everything of conservative value. Now they attack free speech the right to bear arms and the integrity of voting. What is most perplexing is why ! why are they so anti-American and self hating and hating of others with a different opinion. No one seems to ask which country has been better to be in ? America is being destroyed and with it western culture will be eliminated soon. The ""news"" has become propaganda and misinformation.Big tech social media platforms have also become partisan and centers of censorship of conservatism and traditions ! If we do not stop this by becoming more active and spending time and effort to save our country the last best hope for mankind will be destroyed.Ask those who left their countries of birth and came here. There are millions of such people from Russia and the old USSR Cuba China Venezuela Iran Korea Vietnam Africa The Middle East India Europe and the rest of the world ! Even Australia and Scandinavian countries !! America with all its faults was the greatest country in history but it is truly being broken down.By enemies from within with help from outside now.

NIMROD and the 2020 ELECTION You are askingwhat does Nimrod have to do with our upcoming election? Lets take a look at Nimrodhe was the first of the mighty men to appear on earth after the Flood (Genesis 10:8-12). He established a great kingdom which included the city of Babeland oh yesthe Tower of Babel (Genesis 11:1-9). The Tower occurred in the time frame of 2242 B.C. Nimrod was the designer of an ancient power structure and the founder of a false religion. He wanted to become God so he attempted to build a tower to Heaven hoping to thwart the plans of God. Gods mighty power ended the tower construction and the people were settled in other parts of the world.  Nimrod birthed a new religion called globalism that is very active today and still spreading. Here is a partial list of Nimrods spiritual heirs: Illuminati including the Rothschilds and Rockefellers; Clinton organization; Soros; Saul Alinsky; United Nations; Pope Francis and the Global Public Authority; IMF; The World Bank; International Criminal Court; Obama shadow government; Club of Rome; Druids; Free Masons; Bohemian Grove; Yale University Skull and Bones; Satanic Club; Order of Assassins; Bilderberg Group; and the Council of Foreign Relations.  Lets talk about America. God is in control of all that happens in this world. Psalm 75:7 states It is God who judges nations. He brings one down and exalts another. God has allowed America to become a great nation founded on Judeo-Christian principles. But He has a warningHe will bless each nation with a span of time so it might prosper and do well but this blessing ends when a nation becomes degenerate rebellious and unfit to rule.  Our nation was founded in 1776we are 244 years old now! We have an experiment called a representative democracy or a constitutional republic and I believe we are close to losing that experiment.  What has happened to our country in the past sixty some years? America has become completely demoralized desensitized and deceived. For our democracy and republic to work requires the legislative leaders and citizens to be spiritually mature. Your guessdo we have that situation now? And what about the morals of our country? Morals can only be built on the basis of a true moral sourceand that is God. Not following Gods morals will lead to anarchyare we seeing that today? It appears that we have rejected objective moral values in favor of political correctness. Serious questionare we self destructing from within?  I believe we are a post Christian nation. Why? A list of Supreme Court rulings provides the answer. America has crossed over every Biblical boundary!  1962: Removal of prayer in public schools.  1963: Removal of Bible reading in public schools.  1973: Legalized abortions.  1980: Ten Commandments not allowed in public schools.  2003: Struck down sodomy law.  2013: Struck down Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA).  2015: Ruled in favor of same sex marriages.  In addition to the above what are some of the hot issues going on in our country now.  Covid-19 pandemic: A real issue but blown out of proportion and politicized. Churches are non-essential while abortion clinics are essential.  The wall illegals ICE and sanctuary cities.  A national debt of $22 trillion with $100 trillion of unfunded liabilities.  Black Lives Matter White Lives Matter Blue Lives Matter (police). Dont forget all lives matter in Gods sight.  LGBTQ issues.  Abortion euthanasia and the selling of aborted baby parts.  Global warming hoax starring Al Gore.  Epstein/Maxwell and human trafficking.  Defund/dismantle police forces.  The Squad Islam BDS of Israel.  You add to this list please.  Now let me show you how close we are to a full blown socialist state which will lead to a communist state. I mentioned Saul Alinsky abovehe wrote a book called Rules for Radicals. Hillary Clinton did her college thesis on his writings and Obama writes about him in his books. Alinsky expounds there are eight levels of control before you can create a socialist state. Check these out and tell me how we are doing.  1. Healthcare: Control healthcare and you control the people. My responsewe are almost there with a one-payer system called socialized medicine. 2. Poverty: Increase the poverty level as high as possible. Poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live. My responsewe are there now. 3. Debt: Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. My responsewe are there now. 4. Gun control: Take guns away and remove ability to defend oneself. That way you are able to create a police state. My responseenough Americans are armed now and this will not happen in the immediate future. 5. Welfare: Take control of every aspect of their lives. My responsethis is happening as we speak. 6. Education: Take control of what people read and listen to. Take control of what children learn in schools. The saying goesget the children and you have the future. My responsewe are there now. 7. Religion: Remove the belief in God from the government and schools. My responsewe are there now. 8. Class warfare: Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent and it will be easier to tax the wealthy to support the poor. My responsewe are there now.  Not a pretty picture is it!  We are on a fast track to a New World Order which includes a one world government currency and religion. The world has turned to secular humanism and that is the successor to Christianity. It began with the Humanist Manifesto in 1933 then revised in 1973. The theory of evolution replaced Gods six days of creation. Science is now worshiped as mans only hope and science denies Gods creation.  What about our churches? The Bible tells us that in the end times churches will sink into apostasy and worldliness. It is happening! Church influence is weakening or gone. Jesus is not being preached from the pulpit. Name one church today in which the pastor calls abortion a sin from the pulpit. Another pointno true born again believer can support murdering babies. If you believe in the one true God and His Bible then you have to be concerned.  All of the above to get to the 2020 election! Our country is in a big mess. The upcoming November election is the most important one in history when it comes to the future of our country. We are in a struggle for our national soul.  A quick review of the 2016 election. Trump announced his candidacy in June 2015 and then won the election with a 304-227 electoral college victory over Hillary Clinton. Against all oddsTrump showed up! My opinionTrump is not perfect by any means. He was born a sinner just like you and me. But it is obvious that God is using him in many ways as our President. I only wish that Trump be more careful and selective in his language that goes out over the internet the airwaves and print.  What has happened since? The veil of immorality greed corruption and deceit has been torn open. No President has ever faced what Trump has in his first four year term.  Here are just a few:  The Swamp including both Democrats and Republicans.  The never Trumpers (Romney Flake Ryan Bush family and others).  The Dems and mass media being one.  Deep State found in all agencies.  FBI corruption (Comey McCabe Mueller).  The Clintons and their foundation.  Attorney General & Justice Department (Lynch Holder Rosenstein.)  CIA & National Intelligence (Clapper & Brennan).  Obamas Organizing for Action (OFA) shadow government (2 miles from White House). The Organization is a democratic activist group to fight Trumps every move.  Mueller investigation.  FISA abuses.  Illegal immigration issuesthe wall.  Tax returns.  Covid-19 pandemic.  Russian probe.  Impeachment (Schumer Pelosi Nadler Schiff).  Nationalism versus globalism.  Soros threatened to take down Trump to fulfill NWO plans for financial Armageddon.  We know that if Hillary had won all the lies cover-ups and wrong doings done by Obama and Hillary would have been buried. Now they are being uncovered gradually. We are waiting on the Durham report.  The hatred of Trump can only be understood as demonically driven and thus galvanizing the division of our nation. We see that most of the Washington bureaucrats are people of depraved hearts and minds no longer knowing right from wrong.  We need Trump four more years to continue his work in saving maintaining and improving our republic and democracy.  What if Trump loses and the Democrats take the White House the Senate and keep the House. God forbid! If that happens the spiritual heirs of Nimrod win big. I predict we will have a full blown socialist government within eight years.  I do believe that God in His mercy is giving us just a little time as a country to repent. I believe that God has given us plenty of warnings and is beginning His judgment on our country. My opinion is that America will not recoverwe are too far gonewe are beyond the point of returnthere will be no national repentance.  I pray that I am wrong. Please speak up America and vote your heart in November.,political,Facebook
STOP ROMANTICIZING DIVIDED GOVERNMENT IF MCCONNELL IS MAJORITY LEADER THERE WILL BE NO PROGESS.  (Share if you agree DA2020!)  Opinion by Catherine Rampell Columnist  November 9 2020 at 6:27 p.m. EST This column has been updated.  With Joe Biden now president-elect and partisan control of the Senate hanging in the balance pundits are already romanticizing divided government  a Democratic president alongside a Republican-controlled legislative chamber.  It sounds inherently moderate wax some commentators; its a good moment because in order to get something done people are going to have to cooperate and compromise claim others. In this telling divided government is paradoxically just what the country needs to heal our divisions.  Its a nice thought.  Unfortunately a single man stands in the way of this fantasy. And its not the guy in the White House. Its the current Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.)  to whom Senate custom gives nearly unilateral power to block most initiatives from ever getting a vote compromises or efforts toward common ground be damned. Over and over McConnell has already exercised this power.  Its true that today as when President Trump was elected four years ago Democrats and Republicans already agree on oodles of issues. Or at least the exhausted middle majority of Americans and the middle chunk legislators do. Or most Democrats plus some peeled-off Republicans. Or vice versa.  You get the idea. There are indeed obvious solutions to be had and clinched by the middle 50 votes within the Senate if only lawmakers had the courage to cooperate.  For instance lawmakers could finally pass a permanent legislative fix for the Obama-era Deferred Action for Early Childhood Arrivals program which provides partial protections to unauthorized immigrants brought here as children. Large majorities of voters in both parties support these immigrants known as dreamers and a bipartisan agreement giving them a path to citizenship almost materialized two years ago. (Until Trump blew up the efforts of course.)  Resolving other immigration issues remains thorny. But making life better for dreamers is low-hanging bipartisan fruit.  Or there are pocketbook issues important to American families.  In an interview Sunday Republican Sen. Mitt Romney (Utah) spoke about his desire to work with the president-elect and Democrats on an expansion of the child tax credit. Romney already co-sponsors alongside Democratic Sen. Michael F. Bennet (Colo.) a bill to make this credit fully refundable and thus available to the poorest households. Other Republicans and conservatives have supported variants of the idea partly because it can help traditional families with one nonworking parent (usually mom); and nearly every sitting Democratic senator co-sponsors related legislation.  Again an easy win-win. Expanding a similar tax break that rewards work (the Earned Income Tax Credit) likewise has a demonstrated record of appeal among both parties.  Other opportunities for bipartisan kumbaya moments include: more funding for community health centers (which help the poor everywhere but particularly in rural redder states). Or paid parental leave (which both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have endorsed albeit with different funding mechanisms). Or covid-19 aid to small businesses.  Or most any effort to rebuild international relationships that have been shredded over the past four years to much hand-wringing from members of both parties.  Voters seem to like the idea of divided government on the premise that it incentivizes such shared victories. This is part of the pitch Republicans are making about the two U.S. Senate seats in Georgia facing runoff elections which will decide which party ultimately controls the upper chamber next year: If Republicans hold the seats the GOP argues they can not only check Democrats most radical impulses but also deliver the moderate outcomes forced through mutually beneficial cooperation that voters crave.  But if past is prologue such promised cooperation is likely to be a con. At least if McConnell continues running the show as he almost certainly would if those Georgia seats remain Republican.  Recall that back in the day Barack Obama also ran on a platform of healing our divides and bringing political harmony to a polarized Washington. Republicans led by McConnell refuted this promise simply by obstructing nearly every Obama initiative on offer regardless of public support. This forced Obama to implement his agenda through executive action wherever possible which led to GOP accusations of executive-branch tyranny. (Those same Republicans somehow stayed mum when Trump exercised even more executive power including when his party controlled both houses of Congress.)  Any opportunities for finding common ground  and for Biden to prove his political healing powers  will be blocked if McConnell again prevents such legislation from even getting a vote. Which he is likely to do at least if he still believes his top priority is to make a Democratic occupant of the White House a one-term president. His support Thursday for Trump to continue fighting the election results doesnt bode well.  Maybe McConnell will ultimately be less obstructive. Were told that he and Biden are old friends after all. But Charlie Brown and the football-wielding Lucy are sometimes said to be pals too.   1996-2020 The Washington Post,political,Facebook
What is court packing?  Most of you have heard the ruckus over allegations that Joe Biden will pack the courts if elected and he wont deny it when questioned. Many of you may not know what exactly that means so this is for you. The idea of court packing may go all the way back to the founding of this great country but its most prominent iteration occurred in the 1930s while FDR was president.  FDR had a big problem during his presidency with the courts because they were regularly declaring his New Deal actions and programs to be unconstitutional. This was back when the courts still had some sense of self-control when it came to judicial activism. As a result of all of the push back by the courts against his unconstitutional New Deal actions FDR proposed adding one new justice for each justice that was over seventy years of age which at the time applied to six justices. So the court could have ended up with fifteen justices.  This was an attempt by FDR to appoint justices who would ignore the Constitution and would instead decide in his favor. However politicians on both sides of the aisle came out in force against his plan and it never saw the light of day. It appears that even though his plan was refused by Congress the threat itself was enough to get the Supreme Court to start declaring his unconstitutional actions as constitutional. The change in the courts voting behavior became known as the switch in time that saved nine.  So court packing is the action of altering the established form and function of the courts by appointing additional justices who are political activists in order to shift the balance of power to a particular side. Joe Biden said a day or two ago that President Trump is packing the courts and that it is unconstitutional. Joe Biden doesnt know what planet he is on much less what is constitutional or not. President Trump is filling vacancies and there is nothing unconstitutional about that.  Court packing exposes the much greater problem that the courts to steal a line are simply politics by other means. The courts have been used as a tool by politicians since the founding of this country but it went into hyper-drive in the 1930s. The courts have been given too much deference that has allowed them to exercise judgement and power over things the Constitution or subsequent amendments have not provided them. The courts largely have become a joke and when they exceed their authority there is a remedy and that remedy is to ignore them.,political,Facebook
Why Do They HATE The Cops???  It started about 30 years ago in our public-school system. They (the mostly liberal leaning bureaucracy of educators) changed the curriculum being taught to our young innocent impressionable minds. They taught them that our country was bad and rich people and those with a different opinion were racist. They stopped saying the Pledge of Allegiance. They removed the American Flag from many of the classrooms. They made them watch the Inauguration of the Clintons and the Obamas. They taught children that anyone of a different opinion was racist and the cops hated African Americans. They brainwashed a whole generation of our youngest most impressionable minds. They told them if they felt different that was only White Privilege and guilt setting in. They became part of the strongest union in the country i.e. The Teachers Union. Its not these young peoples fault that this is what they were taught in the schools we sent them to...You wonder why there arent more charter schools? Because the left wants these children taught their reality. But you can change this you see it all starts at home. Talk to your kids about R.E.S.P.E.C.T and freedom of speech and choice and our wonderful country. Tell them how lucky we are and how they want to take all of that away. Tell them that the police are there to help us and that they are good. And make sure you vote for Donald J. Trump for President so as to preserve our way of life and uphold the Constitution...  Talk to your children your nieces and nephews and all of those whom will listen.  Theyre worth it as is our way of life.  Love to know your thoughts.  Thanks  Kevin,political,Facebook
Great news! After being closed for 88 days because of the pandemic Eddie has reopened his barber shop on Washington Avenue in Seaford! There were face masks and social distancing but there was the same good spirit and camaraderie that has been Eddies trademark all the years hes been in business.  When I went there around 8:00 this morning plenty of Eddies customers were already there. A few inside. Some more standing out on the sidewalk. Others waiting in their cars reading the morning paper (hopefully not the Times!) Some went home until they got a call telling them their turn was coming soon. The format was that you signed in with your name and cell phone on a legal pad in an opening in the newly installed plexiglass shield on the counter.  For a while I stayed in my parked across the street on Washington Avenue in front of the bus stop. Then I stood outside the barber shop talking with the other guys waiting their turn. Conversation ranged from the pandemic to the demonstrations; the upcoming primary on June 23; President Trumps chances in November; Notre Dame football; how Erin is doing in North Carolina; a Seaford neighbor whose son grew up with Sean asking me how Sean is doing; and comparing Brooklyn and Queens bus routes with a retired City bus driver.  In the middle of this I got a call from Tom Dewey who apparently had enough time on his hands to give me some of his unique abuse and criticism.  When my name was called I went in gave Eddie a warm hello and sat down. Eddie took one look smiled through his mask and told me there was a lot of hair to cut off. Eddie then did his usual professional job and after 15 minutes I was off the chair and back on the street saying goodbye to the guys still waiting.  All were smiling. None complaining. The sun was shining. Eddie was back. Normal life was returning to Seaford!,political,Facebook

Quite from the April 2020 article by Jeffrey Goldberg in the The Atlantic and from several very reliable sources:   Trump rejected the idea of the visit to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery bear Paris in 2018 because he feared his hair would become disheveled in the rain and because he did not believe it important to honor American war dead according to four people with firsthand knowledge of the discussion that day. In a conversation with senior staff members on the morning of the scheduled visit Trump said Why should I go to that cemetery? Its filled with losers. In a separate conversation on the same trip Trump referred to the more than 1800 marines who lost their lives at Belleau Wood as suckers for getting killed.,political,Facebook
More and more cutting back of the larger social spending budget bill. First environmental and now needed benefits for elders critical paid family leave and family protection in general. At some point very close to now the progressives are going to say enough is enough and not vote for the flawed deeply cut bill just to satisfy 2 Senators.  As well the infrastructure bill without the critical larger social spending bill will just increase inequality and division. The infrastructure bill alone only feeds and maintains the current structural inequality and dysfunction of the present state of things.  The progressives need to take a stand here. Either pass both in their robust forms or pass neither. Then move more aggressively to pursue our social justice strategy. We need more backbone. Ill take my chances by striving for what is clearly fair and right rather than continue to accept growing inequality in the service of special interests.,political,Facebook
"The City Officials of St Pete used flash bangs on a peaceful crowd last night just as Trump did in Washington DC to get his ""bible photo op."" The mayor told us today when he took the podium - after our black leaders gave their usual and mandatory congratulations to institutionalized racism militarized Police and systemic poverty - that he remembered his first experience of burning and riots when he was 5 yo in Detroit and a year later after MLKs murder (got to mention MLK). He continued to say that it wasn't until he was a young man that he knew why. He mentioned that in 1967 it was about racism police brutality segregation poverty and housing. Here we are 53 years later with someone that claims to have been fully aware of the issue since he was 5yo and still believe that he can simply appease us with words and promises to gather a committee that would take feedback from the public then make recommendations on the issue to the city council (another committee) regarding an issue that he claims to be well versed in and still according to him with an entourage of black folks that should be fully aware of racism police brutality school segregation redlining and poverty. I am at a loss. Why did we vote for you all? You are telling us that even with your 53 years of experience in addition to all the years of experience of all your staff and city council you are unable to tackle the issue of police brutality yet each and every one of you took the podium that day to claim to be working with the best group of people ever assembled. To Dr. Tomalin: I hate to break it to you but your son is black and privileged. The only thing you fear for him is for our police officers to wear body cams and catch him in a bad act that you cant make disappear. In the meantime the rest of us regular folks are suffering from deliberate police brutality to protect your image and many other families like yours. Everybody can be great because anybody can serve. You don't have to have a college degree to serve. You don't have to make your subject and verb agree to serve...You need a heart full of grace. A soul generated by love.

You Chief dont need to pull your gun or your Taser to abuse or kill someone. Human lives are more precious than any other article we value. Life liberty and the pursuit of happiness. It may be true that the law cannot make a man love me but it can stop him from lynching me and I think that's pretty important. MLK To Mayor Kriseman: You are no longer worth my time.

Troubling times are coming; big tech exerts its power for Social Progress based on viewpoint and politics. Soon I see a world where firearms manufacturers pro-life groups and even religious organizations will not have access to modern cloud platforms and technology limiting their reach.  Every Christian value now is considered hate speech and even acknowledging reality is problematic. Guns are evil and must be censored; stating your own opinion can get you banned from social media or canceled from everything.  Thats why I founded Goliad Technologies; a non-profit focused on providing a neutral platform to controversial organizations so another Parlor GAB Trump or Minds does not happen again.

SATIRE: President Trump was the worst dictator in history. He was a terrible dictator ! Dictators control the media in all forms & with Trump it was the exact opposite ! The fake & fraudulent MSM controlled the news & used misinformation & propaganda the entire time he was in office against Trump ! A competent dictator would have shut them down & destroyed them. Not this one. Dictators destroy the opposition & silence them but the exact opposite happened with Trump. The opposition literally tore him apart with lies & hoaxes & even mobilizing rioters & violent anarchists to destroy his presidency. Dictators use force to crush such anarchy but Trump never even thought of doing that ! They looted and destroyed private & public property for months in a row. Dictators always stay in power by cheating in the polls & voting systems & rigging elections. The exact opposite happened with Trump they rigged & stole the election from him. This failed & incompetent  dictator  was cheated lied about bombarded with fake news & hoaxes targeted by top government agencies like the FBI & the CIA & the DOJ to name a few. This terrible dictator was fraudulently & innocently impeached twice ! Pelosi & team make great dictators. If you want to be a good dictator learn from her ! She even knows how to use a pandemic for power. Real professional dictators are a threat to anyone that opposes them but in this case the threatened was Trump. This dictator was so incompetent as a dictator that social media banned & silenced him not the other way around. They silenced almost 100 million followers of his with zero resistance .A true & tried dictator controls the media the police the armed forces the means of communication the courts and all branches of government. A true dictator destroys all opposition & critics & criticism. But no not Trump ! He knew nothing about dictatorship ! A true & loyal dictator  loyal to dictators & dictatorship would have annihilated these social media opposition dictators. Finally dictators come in with the use of force & if they ever leave its by the use of force or death. Trump failed in that category too because he was  elected. He left because the other side cheated him by force & destruction. There are many other dictator requirements & qualities for a good dictator that Trump lacked ! However One last dictator quality worth mentioning that Trump lacked: Dictators come usually very poor & without much wealth & become enormously rich in office. Richer than most people in their country.  Trump is the only dictator in history who came in rich but left less rich !

My campaign has just submitted my completed questionnaire to the Chicago Sun-Times. Im sharing my responses below:  Thomas J Wilda Running for the 5th Congressional District seat in Illinois Green Party Social Worker PhD Facebook/Twitter/Instagram: @TomWilda2020 1 . Are you satisfied with the federal governments response to the COVID-19 pandemic? Why or why not? What grade would you give President Donald Trump for his handling of the pandemic and why? This pandemic was not taken seriously from the beginning. The failed response began before the pandemic hit with the reduction and near elimination of the CDC staff. Lack of equipment can be blamed on poor management and years of depending on labor camps in China to produce the equipment. President Trump failed to enact the Production Defense Act failed to abide by CDC guidelines failed to give help to the states in following CDC guidelines. We are left with the worse response to his crisis in the world the most cases the most deaths. Our country gets an F for our response. 2. What should the federal government do to stimulate economic recovery from the pandemic shutdowns? There is an immediate need for a UBI (Universal Basic Income) for every adult citizen in the country. $3000 a month is needed. For those that do not need it it can be taxed back. People need to pay rents and mortgages. Businesses that were doing well before the pandemic need to have payroll and expense support so that they will be viable after the pandemic. Medicare for all must be enacted to ensure medical coverage for citizens and payments to hospitals medical facilities and doctors. 3. In the wake of the death of George Floyd President Trump signed an executive order on police reform. It calls for the creation of a database to track police officers with multiple instances of misconduct federal grants to encourage police departments to meet higher certification standards on use of force and the greater involvement of social workers and mental health professionals when the police respond to calls dealing with homelessness mental illness and addiction. The order also calls for police departments to ban the use of chokeholds except when an officer feels his or her life is endangered. Will this be enough to address concerns about police brutality? If not what other steps should be taken? These reforms are not enough. President Trump (and it occurred with President Obama also) proudly gave assault military equipment to police departments. Police departments have developed a culture of military presence with a siege mentality. This process has been many years in the making. Police departments should be defunded and then refunded. Police officers can reapply for their position. All new police officers will be required to train in non-violent processes. Military equipment must be returned to the federal government. Police officers must be licensed with a requirement of continuing education in order to maintain their license. Civilian police boards must be enacted with the power to review suspend and terminate officers. 4. Also in the wake of the death of George Floyd the House passed the Justice in Policing Act which would ban police departments from using chokeholds develop a national standard for use of force limit the transfer of military weapons to police departments define lynching as a federal hate crime establish a national police misconduct registry and limit qualified immunity which protects officers from lawsuits over alleged misconduct. Do you support this legislation? Why or why not? What other steps if any would you like to see the federal government take on police reform? I do support this legislation. Please see my prior response for what other steps are needed for reform. 5. Whats your view on President Trumps decision to commute the sentence of Roger Stone? There are many people in prison for long sentences for possessing a very small amount of marijuana. It is not right that those that commit white collar crimes are treated better than other citizens. The president needs to commute the sentences of many people who have committed small crimes. 6. Please tell us about your civic work in the last two years whether its legislation you have sponsored or other paid or volunteer work to improve your community. The last years I have had a private practice in psychotherapy. Many of my clients have an inability to pay due to immigration status and other reasons. I have treated a good number of people pro bono. In past years I have worked with the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless; helped establish a homeless center and worked with various community groups. I am also a founding member of the Alliance for Just Money. 7. What are your views on the decision by the U.S. House to impeach President Donald Trump? Was the impeachment process fair or not? How so? If in your view the president should not have been impeached would you have supported censure? Please explain. The Democrats attempted to impeach the President on false premises. Evidence used was not genuine. The Steele dossier was a made-up document. The process was an attempt to avoid addressing the flaws in the Democratic platform as well as the support of a flawed candidate in a corrupt primary process. There are many things the President may be criminally liable for but these were not investigated. I think mostly because many politicians of both major parties are guilty of similar offenses. The process of impeachment was a sham and removed our attention from the wars we are in the out of control military budget the climate crisis and much more. 8. How would you reduce the federal budget deficit which now stands at about $1 trillion for 2020? What changes if any to the U.S. tax code do you support and why?  Firstly the budget deficit this year will be $3-4 trillion. It is this deficit that is often used as the reason we cannot have good things like Medicare for All forgiveness of student debt and free education. The deficit exists because the country relies on private banks purchasing Treasury Bonds for its money supply. There are few banks that are qualified to do this so the process is in the hands of a small number of people. In buying Treasury Bonds banks fund the government. They buy the bonds with money made from thin air but expect the money to be repaid with interest. So we have debt. When the government cannot cover its costs through taxation they sell more bonds. This process was established by The Federal Reserve system in 1913. All banks must be part of it. As part of this act private banks can create money from nothing for other purposes such as mortgages and student loans. Banks create money only through the establishment of debt. This debt under the current system can never be paid back. It does not have to be this way. Article 1 section 8 clause 5 of the US Constitution gives the federal government the right to create money without debt. My proposal would be to eliminate the Federal Reserve and the right of banks to create money with debt and create a monetary authority under the Department of the Treasury. The authority would determine the amount of money needed in the economy to provide for the common welfare and common needs. The Treasury would establish this amount and it would be budgeted by Congress. This would be clean money without debt. What about the debt that exists? It would be paid back to the banks by the Treasury over a period of years. Probably around 100. Banks would have money for their reserves and to lend for new investments and business ventures Regarding the tax code: All should be paying their fair share. The wealthiest have the first access to created money the average citizen has the last access. The last pay the most and the first pay the least. We need to change that so that the first are last and the last are first. That would be a fair tax system. 9. What changes would you like to see made to our nations healthcare system? Would you shore up the Affordable Care Act or work to repeal it in full? Whats your view on Medicare for All? And what should be done if anything to bring down the cost of prescription drugs? This is so easy. Medicare at 100% for all is the least expensive and most fair way to fund a healthcare system. Look at the rest of the developed world. The government through Medicare for all would be able to negotiate the price of drugs but medications would be paid for by a Medicare for all program. 10. Do you support or oppose DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) and why? Should a path to citizenship be created for the so-called DREAMers? Please explain. This is just simple justice. Those who came here as children and have grown up here and contribute to society have a right to stay. Anything else would be inhuman. Of course they should be able to become citizens. 11. What are the three most important issues in your district on which the federal government can and should act? In terms of the Federal Government for this district and many districts UBI with fair tax system is needed Medicare for all and a just distribution of federal dollars for human needs in the district. 12.  What is the biggest difference between you and your opponent(s)? I really dont know where my Republican opponent stands on these issues. As far as my Democratic opponent and the incumbent well I would say look at his voting record. 13. What action should Congress take if any to reduce gun violence? Military grade weaponry needs to be illegal. Other guns must be registered and owning a gun most be licensed with a requirement of yearly continuing education on gun safety. Police should be as focused on illegal gun sales as they are on drug sales. 14. Is climate change real? Is it significantly man-made? Is it a threat to humankind? What if anything should Congress and the federal government do about it? The knowledge that burning fossil fuels creates climate change was researched and confirmed by the oil companies themselves in the 1950s 70 years ago. It is not a debate in the scientific community; only the business community wants there to be a debate. We already see the effects of climate change and it will get worse. What is needed is a Green New Deal. We need to get off fossil fuels reduce consumption of energy and create jobs to protect water forests and animals our ecosystem both micro and macro. 15. What should Congress do to ensure the solvency of Social Security and Medicare? During the Reagan administration the Social Security fund was used to balance the budget. This money was taken from Social Security to make an economic policy appear better. There have been raids on Social Security ever since. There is no crisis of Social Security. Social Security is not part of the budget so cutting it would not make a difference in the deficit. The effort to reduce Social Security is totally inhumane. Social Security will be solvent if the money owed to it is paid. I am for Medicare for all. 16. What should Congress do to address the student loan crisis? Would you use the word crisis? Student debt is a crisis. It puts many from the younger generations in the position of being indentured servants. They are not able to participate fully in the economy because so much of their income goes to debt payment. Student loans should be assumed by the Federal Government and added to the deficit that will be paid overtime when we have a just clean money system. Yes this is a crisis for those who are burdened with this debt but this is also a crisis for the economy as money that pays back debt is not money that goes into the development of the economy. 17. What should our nations relationship be with Russia? We should have fair and just relationships with all nations. We should not have a belligerent oppositional relationship with any country. It is not in the interests of the American people to have such relationships only the interests of the military industrial complex. 18. Whats your view on the use of tariffs in international commerce? Has President Trump imposed tariffs properly and effectively? Please explain. President Trump uses tariffs as punishments. The industrialists have been sending jobs to places without worker protection and in the case of China to foreign labor camps for awhile. Once there is a truly fair workplace in every country there would be little need for tariff protection. We should be ensuring that workers are treated fairly both here and everywhere else and that ecological protections are in place everywhere. Once we have accomplished this tariffs will take care of themselves. 19. Does the United States have a responsibility to promote democracy in other countries? Please explain. We need to have democracy in the United States first. We know that our intelligence agencies have been undermining democracy in the rest of the world. This is not in service of the American people but in the interests of big business. We should not send military anywhere with the excuse that we are doing it to protect democracy. We are in other countries to secure wealth for the richest. 20. What should Congress do to limit the proliferation of nuclear arms? Demand that the President negotiate a nuclear arms reduction treaty with all nuclear powers with the end goal of eliminating all nuclear arms. 21. Please list all relatives on public or campaign payrolls and their jobs on those payrolls. None 22. What historical figure from Illinois other than Abraham Lincoln (because everybodys big on Abe) do you most admire or draw inspiration from? Please explain. I was inspired by Paul Simons moral and principled stances on issues. 23. Whats your favorite TV streaming or web-based show of all time. Why?

My opponent is now attempting to go down the trump law and order path. It has many allegations based on flimsy notions.  Once again I am far ahead of Len Turcotte. Two weeks ago I offered to anyone in Barrington the final report on the Governors commission on policing in NH. I did this because I respect the citizens judgment after they read the report - which I have. I support the results of this nonpartisan review. Legislation being considered for the next session is directly lifted from those recommendations.  I dont manage from a rigid ideology. I voted in a way to protect sanctuary cities because I am against the current practice of ICE putting kids in cages and separating them from their parents. This is a part of a much larger discussion which I am happy to have with Mr. Turcotte if he decides to leave his foxhole and have a full on open debate.,political,Facebook
This entire Senate election is very very sad. If Rankin's allegations against Gallman were true it would certainly be an outrage. But why did Rankin and his team wait til after Carter Smith was out of the three-way race? If Rankin and his supporters had done so the day after John Gallman announced then voters would have had the time to seek the truth.  If Luke had agreed to a public debate these accusations could have come out with John Carter and Luke on the stage and all of us would have seen Johns face and non-verbals as it was brought up. Instead Team Rankin waits till Carter Smith is out of the race then ALL of a sudden the moral outrage and these accusations are dropped on the voters like a trump card in a game.  This is not a game! Over 4000 babies are aborted in SC a year our schools are some of the lowest ranking in our country our county does not get its fair share of state resources and our single parents and children who are in need go hungry and struggle. And yet Rankin has served in the Senate for 28 years. What has he done?  We could also mention the Santee Cooper debacle our under-funded State Pension plan and God knows what else...

"Because Joe Biden insists on attacking the unvaccinated we now find ourselves at a place in history where Americans are cheering on the fact that their fellow Americans are being ostracized from everyday life. Even here in a red state like Texas where life liberty and property are supposed to be hallmarks of society every day we are seeing more and more Texans being removed from their jobs schools and other stations in life for simply making a health decision best fits their life situation.  And that divide only deepens when we see Biden and the democrats saying things like the unvaccinated people were ""not nearly as smart as I thought you were."" We see the media pushing narratives like blaming the unvaccinated for the continuation of the pandemic Biden's poor approval numbers hindering economic growth costing jobs and putting unnecessary strain on the healthcare system.  We now live in a country where our borders are being overwhelmed; consumer prices are nearing record highs inflation is quickly pushing us towards a recession employers cannot find help and spending is out of control. And the most common narrative being pushed out of the Whitehouse and in the media is that the unvaccinated are being labeled unemployable and are being ostracized from society so that we can protect the vaccinated from the unvaccinated because the unvaccinated refuse to get the vaccine that didn't protect the vaccinated in the first place.  Personal agency over our own lives is one of the most fundamental tenents of a free society. If you have chosen to be vaccinated because you believe it protects you and it is what's best for you then it shouldn't matter if others are vaccinated because you are protected. And if you are unvaccinated because you believe that it is your right to make healthcare decisions for yourself and your family then what someone else's healthcare choices are should be none of your concern. We have somehow found ourselves in this quasi-socialist communist place where too many Americans now believe the interests of society somehow trump those of the individual. Our nation was founded on the rights of the individual not those of the community. And if we desire to continue to remain a free society and have personal agency over our lives we must move away from this collectivist ideology and return to the ideology of individual rights spelled out by our founders which has served us well for nearly 250 years.  And it starts by electing people who are willing to stand up for you and fight for your individual rights. I will go to Austin to represent you! Not the special interest groups and lobbyists.

Trump shouldnt pardon Flynn.yet  As you probably know Judge Emmet Sullivan has refused to drop the case against General Michael Flynn but has instead opted to appoint a former federal judge to present arguments against the DOJs decision to drop the case against Flynn and to see if Flynn should be held in contempt of court for perjury which I guess is for lying about being guilty. I guess Judge Sullivan has never had defendants in his court plead guilty to a crime which they did not commit. This is said to be a very inappropriate and unprecedented move by Sullivan.  I dont know Sullivans motivations but I have heard him spoken of very favorable. Even Flynns attorney Sydney Powell has thought a great deal of him in the past because of his actions in the Ted Stevens case. Stevens was at one time a senator from Alaska who was victimized by federal prosecutorial misconduct.  Judge Sullivan may be a left wing loon using his position as an accomplice to the deep state or he may be highly peeved and embarrassed that his court was used by the deep state to further a travesty of justice. He certainly is fully aware that prosecutors and investigators are capable of lying and is fully aware that these same individuals can bring such pressure to bear on the target Flynn in this case that the target will acquiesce and plead guilty to a crime not committed. Thats why its called a plea agreement. Im sure more will come out that will help to determine his true motivations so I will leave it at that.  The reason I think President Trump should not pardon Flynn at this time is because I think it will be better to use the same system to vindicate him that was used to railroad him. I want to see the system and the players eat crow publicly and as embarrassingly as possible. I think the prospects will be greatly enhanced of him becoming a very wealthy man after he sues the federal government for its prosecutorial misconduct investigative misconduct his financial ruin defending himself against this travesty and the hit upon his personal integrity. This should be played out all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary. What do you think would carry a more powerful message of public disgrace for the DOJ and in particular the FBI and those involved a dismissal by the Supreme Court or a pardon by President Trump?  President Trump can pardon Flynn at any time even going out the door if Biden wins the presidency. The Left is not going to go down without a fight so the rancor that has followed the DOJs decision to drop the case should not have been a surprise. As the days pass we will learn Judge Sullivans motives. If he is an accomplice to the deep state it will be easily detected because his court will fill with kangaroos and as more of the illegal activities of the deep staters are uncovered it will become impossible to deny the obvious.,political,Facebook
Is this the least inclusive most racist and exclusive country in the world ? You would think so if you listen to the democrats. Its all doom And gloom. Everything is terrible here. They are always correcting crises that they create or do not exist in the first place. Nancy Pelosi thinks its hard to vote so lets eliminate any requirements to vote. Just let anyone vote with no documents or ID and let them mail in their ballots. Let everyone coming to the border come in too otherwise its inhumane. There is no crisis at the border. Its all a game called catch and release Lets vote trillions of dollars of  relief for the people except it does not go for Covid or the people. Who is going to pay for the insurmountable debt ? The real crises such as keeping schools closed and shutting down businesses and rioting and burning and looting and occupying the Capital is not a crisis. The law has become threatening riots if the court does not rule a certain way. Its called  no justice no peace ! Hundreds of thousands of jobless homeless drug addicts and criminals but we want transgender men to compete in womens sports. If not that is a major crisis ! China is taking over the world and soon going to dominate the globe but we think women are not treated equally here. I wonder which country it is where people are better off? Is it those countries where everyone is trying to leave to come here ? That seems to be the whole world. Gas and oil are a huge crisis like climate change and global warming. Remember only 9 years left for the weather apocalypse! Trump is gone so now they need lots of imaginary crises and problemsto fix. God forbid if they came up with a real new idea or solution for the country. They make up for it with distraction and deflection and noble battles to fight against  windmills and other ghost enemies.,political,Facebook

"There no longer exists a democrat party. They have become socialists fascists and anti American. They are so full of hate and so misled by their leaderships in almost all areas.It is about political control and big government. Their handling of the Covid 19 pandemic and the ""protests"" has been disgraceful. Not only have they not discouraged rioting and looting and destruction and anarchy they have almost encouraged it with their rhetoric and sometimes their silence. There is no denial that they are the biggest and most dangerous enemy of the people and the nation. They are obsessed with getting control of power and spend their entire collective time scheming calculating and plotting from mayors to governors to Senators and House representatives in destroying President Trump. Dividing people and promoting hate is their latest shameful method. The disgusting  fake news MSM is complicit in this treachery and objective. Have you noticed that there is not one report of polls starting with the headline that Trump is ahead in any state. The MSM ""breaking news"" regarding polls is always to announce that Biden has increased his lead. I wonder if there is even one state where President Trump is leading. What a joke ! Suppression polls and suppression fake news hand in hand. Their whole strategy is based on influencing the naive and uninformed and gullible and unaware and the stupid. Now they want to make DC into a state because without these corrupt changes they know they cannot win.Their most heroic act is painting 'Black Lives Matter"" on streets and some buildings. The police are resigning and leaving and murder rates and other crimes are way up. Go ahead defund the police destroy the country encourage anarchy. Eventually you will awaken a very large silent majority who will do whatever is necessary to protect their lives and the lives and property of their loved ones and their country.",political,Facebook

Hypocritical much?  You know I spent many years avoiding politics on social media because well who really wants to be voluntarily attacked? Thats the problem with todays society opposing views are condemned instead of just understanding their path in life was different and thats what lead to their ideals. I saw a comment the other day that a liberal didnt like talking to her conservative friends anymore...well same because conservatives are labeled has callous and racist somehow? Fun fact a republican president ended slavery...  This the the hypocrisy that I have issues with liberals about:  1. You condemn Trump for his alleged affairs but Clinton admitted to having an affair in the Oval Office.  2. You call Melania weak and a puppet for staying with Trump but you put Hillary on pedestal for her resilience and strong nature for staying with Bill.  3. You spent two years trying to prove Russia interfered with the election and that we need stricter enforcements but want mail in voting. (Because obviously that is the most efficient way to make sure every vote is counted AND that it is not fraudulent).  4. Raising minimum wage does not put America first or create more jobs...increasing minimum wage increases the most expensive part of COGS already so it makes the increase moot AND makes American manufacturers have to produce overseas to be competitive in the market. (In case you dont understand that it closes American factories losing jobs not gaining).  5. You condemn Trump for not doing enough to stop the pandemic but called him racist when he closed the travel borders to slow the spread. Your solution to the problem is passing a bill but you refuse to negotiate a reasonable bill before the election because it will boost the economy and Trumps re-election.  6. You blame Trump for the current stimulus bill that is stalled but Congress is the one with more power and they went on vacation. You also condemned him for forcing the EDD benefits and forcing the states to take some responsibility...and why shouldnt they the states are shutting down the economy not the federal government. -Also any individuals accepting the additional $300 that curses Trumps name when he is the only reason you are getting something additional...your leaders would rather do nothing than at least pass legislation that does have consensus you should ask them why!  7. Biden calling this Trumps Recession when the reality of the recession is from California being shutdown not something Trump did. California is the 5th largest economy in the WORLD all of its own if you dont understand that is the largest thing hindering our economy right now you didnt pay attention in high school.  8. His tax returns...quite frankly I could care less. Every single American does everything they can to pay the least amount of taxes possible so why this is so important to Democratics is beyond me. You know one of the reasons Biden pays so much in taxes? His lack of charitable contributions...and Trump is donating his entire Presidential salary to charity so go figure.  Another fun fact: Trump was nominated twice for the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize for the recent Israeli-UAE-Bahrain peace talks.  My point is not to deter you from your beliefs it is to say that neither side is perfect. Trump is an average American in terms of his speaking but whether you want to admit it or not hes a pretty good businessman. It took a pandemic and world shutdown to stop the economic growth we were experiencing in the US. The only reason we have not recovered as much as we should is the continued shutdown of California and a few other states. COVID is real the sensationalism and fear is not but history has shown that when the economy is good an incumbent President is 100% re-elected. So the hate that dems have for Trump is greater than the health and stability of our nation thats not American.  Disclaimer: I do not agree with everything that Trump says but I in no way wish for his failure because we all fail when that happens no matter who is that office.  May God Bless our Country over the next few weeks as more hate and negativity is spread during these elections.  ,political,Facebook
My thoughts and prayers as well as those of #TeamMikula go out to President Trump and the First Lady who both just tested positive for COVID-19. I hope they both remain asymptomatic and quickly recover.  We must continue to remain vigilant of COVID-19 and continue to practice common sense safety precautions - such as hand washing social distancing (when possible) and mask usage (where appropriate); however we must also follow the lead of President Trump and continue on normally with our lives as much as possible with the realization that this virus is likely to be around for the foreseeable future and we cannot keep ourselves and our communities locked down forever.  As with most things in life we are able to compromise between two extremes - in this case not just ignoring the virus but also not living in total fear of it and allowing it to disrupt our way of life indefinitely.  #TeamMikula #HistoryOfService,political,Facebook
We're in the Endgame Now -- Part II -- A New Hope  Less than three months from now the current terms of office for Donald John Trump and Mike Pence will come to an end. Even a clear Biden win presents many dangers for America. Today I focus on what we might expect in the 79-day Interregnum between the election & inauguration.  Three months ago I published my first Were in the Endgame Now column looking at the final six months of this presidential term using the ten Domino Principles as a foundation to shape my forecast (I have included a link to it in the comments below this posting). That column has so far proven to be accurate and prescient in pretty much every material detail and I must admit it has led to my developing a bit of a Cassandra complex. While we cant predict the specifics of future events with certainty The Domino Principles provide a framework that allows us to assess in broad strokes many of the likelihoods and probabilities for what may occur.  As I write this column there are 15 remaining days until the presidential and Senate election on November 3. The forecasting website presently gives Joe Biden an 88% chance of winning the election and a 37% chance of him winning by a double-digit margin. It only gives a 4% chance that the election will hinge on a recount. It gives the Democrats about a 74% chance of gaining control of the Senate. These projections are reassuring but hardly cause for extreme confidence. Trump still has a 1-in-8 chance of winning which is not trivial. There is still better than a 1-in-4 chance that the Republicans will retain control of the Senate which is still a substantial possibility. The consequences of such possible outcomes are so grim that this is most assuredly NOT a time for complacency.  It is heartening to see so many Americans making their voices heard in an all out effort to save democracy against an existential threat of fascism and corruption and we must be relentless in continuing it for the next 15 days. Not only are Americans turning out to vote in record numbers they are also opening up their pocketbooks in record amounts to provide candidates working to save democracy the resources they need to get their message out. Third quarter fundraising and cash-on-hand announcements for the presidential race and for most of the critical US Senate races show that Democratic Senate campaigns pulled in more than $240 million dollars in Q3 fundraising vastly outpacing their Republican challengers. Joe Biden also raised $383 million for his candidacy in September with $432 million in cash in the bank at the end of the month vastly outpacing Trumps $248 million in fundraising during September with $251.4 million in cash at the end of the month.  A lot has been written about Trumps and Russias efforts designed to interfere in the upcoming election suppress the vote and cast uncertainty upon and dispute the results. In particular Trump is preparing to do everything he can to try to dispute the results in Florida and Pennsylvania if they do not go his way. But at least as of today there is a good chance that despite the success of some voter suppression efforts both of these states may very well resolve for Biden with margins that are beyond reasonable dispute. Meanwhile Arizona North Carolina and Georgia are all leaning slightly towards Biden and there is a realistic chance that Ohio Iowa and Texas could also shift to Biden by the time all the votes are counted. Americans should be prepared for the possibility that votes will not be robustly counted to the point of assessing a winner until days after the actual election.  Lets focus today on looking at what is now the most likely (but by no means certain) scenario for the next three months in which Biden wins the election by a clear margin despite all of Trumps and Russias efforts to stop that from happening. Even this best case scenario is still fraught with many difficulties. If this comes to pass what issues might we expect to manifest during the 79-day Interregnum period between election day and inauguration day?  The Plague  First and foremost of course as winter approaches an America that has not adequately dealt with the COVID-19 crisis is going to see massive infection rates and many more deaths. 220000+ Americans are now dead. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation forecasts that cumulative US deaths by inauguration day will range from 360000+ to 419000+ depending on how much socialization and masking restrictions are further eased. (Note that with universal masking the projected number of deaths by January 20 2021 would be far lower around 298000.)  As Dr. Anthony Fauci has stated I think were facing a whole lot of trouble and This is an outbreak of historic proportions the likes of which weve not seen in 102 years. Advances in testing therapeutics and potential vaccines technologies are indeed making progress but they are not expected to make a significant impact until later in 2021. Meanwhile leadership from the White House in setting standards for protecting Americans wont begin until (and if) Biden takes office in late January.  It still isnt at all clear that Trump is entirely through the medical repercussions of his COVID-19 infection. Should Biden fall ill at some point it would surely create further drama for America.  The Psychopath  As John Bolton stated on CNNs The Insiders yesterday Trump will not leave graciously. In the final days leading up to the election it isnt unlikely that Trump will use threats of the damage he might cause to America to try to persuade people to vote for him or else. Both before and after the election we will also see a continuing stream of people jumping ship to speak out about Trumps crimes and abuses and to claim that they were against it all along. Of course Trump will wage war against these individuals.  Even an obvious election loss will of course be termed a corrupt hoax and conspiracy by Trump. He may deny the reality. He will certainly rage against it. He will want revenge and this time it will be against all of America not just the blue states that voted against him.  A lame duck Trump wont do virtually ANYTHING for America that doesnt provide him a personal reward or benefit. In the best possible light Trump will go AWOL. In the most likely scenarios however he will burn and destroy in retreat and almost certainly engage in vastly criminal and unethical acts to try to cover up the many vastly criminal and unethical acts he has kept hidden so far. He will also surely encourage others to commit such acts and he will likely promise them pardons in return for doing so implicitly or explicitly.  I expect that a lame-duck Donald Trump would see the transition time as one in which he will do everything in his power to bring financial and legal benefit and relief to his business ventures and himself. In the pursuit of such activities I doubt that he would hesitate in the least to make deals particularly with foreign entities that will in a treasonous manner compromise Americas classified secrets along with our national security and our safety.  I dont expect that Trump will agree to do anything with regards to the pandemic or the recession unless it significantly benefits himself and his businesses. After three more months without significant relief for the unemployed and for small businesses a Biden presidency would begin with America seeing massive levels of people losing their homes and their companies. But at least there is some solace in that Joe Biden has experience with this kind of a situation because it is so similar in many respects to the way that his tenure as Obamas Vice President began.  I expect that when the current federal budget continuing resolution expires on December 11 2020 there is a good chance that Trump will refuse to negotiate in good faith on keeping the government open until Bidens inauguration on January 20 2021. There is certainly a chance that the government will be shutdown for an extended period of time perhaps the entire remainder of the Interregnum. But with Trump no longer having any real leverage over most of the Republican Senators it is possible that there will at some point be enough bipartisan support for Congress to override a presidential veto or non-signing thereby getting the government funded again.  While it isnt at all likely if Trumps behavior is outrageous enough it isnt impossible that when the new Congress convenes on January 3 2021 it will be forced to consider a quick impeachment in the House followed by another trial to remove Trump from office in the Senate. This would allow Pence to serve out the remainder of the term as President. Even though the Senate still wont have 67 Democratic votes needed to remove Trump from office it isnt impossible that a Democratic-led Senate would be able to find 15  20 Republicans willing to vote to remove Trump from office a couple of weeks early in order to put an end to the madness. Depending on how crazy things get 25th Amendment scenarios are also more likely in a lame duck presidency. Finally it isnt impossible that Trump might say to hell with America and resign early with the implicit or explicit understanding that Mike Pence will pardon him for his crimes.  The Pardons  My expectation is that it is quite possible that Trump will in some way shape or form attempt to facilitate pardons and/or clemency for himself his family his cabinet and his sycophants for anything and everything that they have done or might have ever done. The outrage and injury to America from this happening will be extensive and shocking.  The Supreme Court  As I mentioned in my column three months ago the loss of Ruth Bader Ginsburg from the Supreme Court before the end of the current presidency could have bleak and long lasting repercussions and could have an immediate effect on Trumps efforts to invalidate an election loss. Unfortunately that possibility has come to pass.  As I write this a rush-through nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to fill Ginsburgs seat is working its way through the US Senate. There is presently a strong likelihood but not a certainty that she will be confirmed to fill that seat.  Two key takeaways from watching this process are: 1) Trump has stated that he is in a rush to fill the seat before the election because he feels Barretts vote on the court could help him if an election issue makes its way to the high court. The implication here is that Trump is extremely uncertain of his ability to retain power against the will of the American people and he is desperate to do everything he possibly can to try to fix the process in his favor. And 2) this nomination is being pushed through in such a rushed manner that the American people clearly see it as yet another effort on the part of the Republican party to pack the Supreme Court with dark-money backed justices who a) place the interests of businesses and business owners ahead of the interests of the American people; and b) lack a dedication to furthering the principles of justice and equality in a manner that reflects the values of the majority of Americans.  Because of these factors my sense is that if Biden wins the presidency and the Senate flips to a Democratic majority then the majority of Americans will support actions such as the expansion of the number of justices on the Supreme Court designed to reflect the diversity and the values of the majority of Americans. Most concerning will be the cases in which arguments are heard or decisions are issued from November through January before any such actions can be taken.  The Transition  In late September Nancy Cook writing for Politico reported that assistant to the president Chris Liddell was hard at work on developing a transition plan for a possible Trump presidency exit. Cook characterized it as one of the most organized and functional parts of the Trump White House. As Cook noted however:  The question is whether Liddell can maintain this level of professionalism if and when Trump starts paying more attention to the prospect of leaving office. Trumps last transition team under Gov. Chris Christie also ran smoothly and made plans for hiring Cabinet officials and rolling out executive orders  until the Trump team fired Christie days after winning and threw his binders of plans in the trash.  I suspect the president is totally unaware one former Obama transition official said about Trump and the transition plans. It could go sideways as soon as he knows this is going on.'  Sideways is a charitable word. My expectation is a full reverse accompanied by deliberate acts of sabotage and surprises as Biden becomes aware post inauguration of secret promises along with a myriad of compromising national security breaches that Trump has engaged in with foreign leaders.  A New Hope  If Biden wins it will be a tremendous vindication and victory for the broad coalition of American conservatives moderates and liberals who have come together to end Trumps all out assault on democracy. Whatever chaos and darkness Trump creates during the Interregnum the shadow from his deeds will occur under the backdrop of the hope and promise of an extraordinarily challenging but also much brighter future one in which a broad coalition of patriots strives to work together to rebuild a better America. It will come at a time at which we will know that Americans faced the greatest challenge to democracy in the history of the country and won.  Americas cultural problems and prejudices once hidden are all in the daylight now. Instead of continuing to witness the continued slow decline in American power and prestige of the pre-Trump era the tragedies of the past four years could become a singular catalyst that puts America on an entirely different and more promising trajectory.  As James Carville recently wrote in A Crusade for Something Noble: I can say with certainty that in all my years joining in this crusade to take America back from the brink of destruction is the greatest thing I have ever been a part of in my life. This election is our one and last chance to say loudly and clearly to the world: this was not who and what we are. This is not who and what America IS. We can be better than this. We ARE going to better than this.  It is with hope and promise that I look forward to the possibility of us exploring together what such a future might bring.,political,Facebook
"UPDATED: 205000+ Americans dead a majority of them an unnecessary consequence of incompetence and deliberate malfeasance.

"Yesterday...I surmise Christine Merser  Yesterday morning while speaking to a friend on the phone I said I had hope for the first time in a long time. I saw a change. Police departments across the country on their knees and the kind and generous way they were embraced by those who had feared them for generations. I could see that we CAN come together as a nation.  Silly girl. Trump saw it too and he realized that unless he keeps fear in the hearts of those Americans who aren't sure who to trust to keep them safe and prosperous he will lose. Resoundingly.  Then he spoke to Putin in the early morn. If Kim Jong Un is still alive maybe he spoke to him too. I have a feeling he has his own ring on Trump's cell phone. Then Trump spoke to the governors of this country and laid out a Putin-type approach to those that dare to stand up and lead rather than tow the line of sheep to a slaughter. Squash those protesters and show the world we are as strong as Russia and North Korea in keeping our people in line. If you do not I will squash you. (My words not his) No governors hung up. None really came back at him. They just sat there and then leaked it to the press which is cowardly if you ask me.  Then came the hammer in the early evening. Trump's first press conference since the white knee on black man's neck a week earlier. His face thrust forward defiantly LOVING the message. I can visualize when someone laid the plan out for him of what would happen. A little kid excitement without a thought as to repercussions or even what would happen next. The sheer strength of the words. This moment is not a man hiding in a bunker. ""I will show them how strong - how brave - I am."" LOVING the visual of taking control of the country the same way Russia and North Korea would. ""Ask not what your country can do for you do what I say or the hammer will come down on you!"" Then he gassed those peacefully protesting BEFORE legal curfew so he could walk across the street and hold up a bible which he can't quote from because he's never opened it in front of a church whose female leader immediately condemned and he felt like he was king of the mountain.  And so police knelt in solidarity last night and the bridges that had started to be built the day before? They are forgotten this morning as we read of looting.  Well done Donald.  What is needed? A leader to speak following Trump's terrifying power play last night? One that has the ability to motivate and calm waters and inspire. Help wanted America. It's not Biden who stays safely inside his mantra of vote him out in November which right now does absolutely nothing to offer something other than Trump's rhetoric. Biden has to set the election aside if he is a leader as he says and start to speak to America about what we can do NOW.  We need a Martin Luther King. Or a Bobby Kennedy. Or a Barack Obama who I am sure thinks he has to tread lightly to not make Biden look weak. But the November election be damned in my opinion right now we must do something now to stop this forest fire from totally obliterating our country's strength and possibility.  Other than that I have no opinion about yesterday.",political,Facebook

"I want to challenge the people who say they will vote for Donald Trump because he is Pro-Life. No. Hes Not.  225230 Americans have already died due to Covid19. That doesnt sound like Pro-Life. And just yesterday: ""We are not going to control the pandemic"" Meadows (Mark Meadows White House Chief Of Staff) told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" Sunday. And yet other countries are controlling Covid19.

Like many of you I am personally against abortion with exceptions for rape incest the health of the mother or the inability of the fetus to survive outside the womb. And just as a reminder there is no such thing as a VOLUNTARY late-term abortion. It Doesnt happen. There are only heart-breaking emergency medical procedures by mothers and fathers who have already decorated their nurseries. They make the very tough decision to terminate the pregnancies due to the mothers life being in danger or the inability of the fetus to survive outside the womb. It is plain and simple a tragedy absolutely not a VOLUNTARY late-term abortion as some misleading Republicans are saying.  Please join me in voting Donald Trump out of office. Im also voting against our Senator Mitch McConnell and Congressman Andy Barr who also claim to be Pro-Life. I hold them responsible for all the Covid19 deaths as well. #VoteToSaveAmericanLives #VoteBidenHarris #VoteAmyMcGrath #VoteJoshHicks Thank you.",political,Facebook

So as we Small Business owners expected but the know-it-alls seem surprised about the new jobs report showed a small amount of job creation.  We all know of landlords (like Myself) that haven't received rent in a year and a half from protected tenants and we all know business owners who can't find workers to hire even though we are willing to pay them and give them security more than likely because of the generous additional unemployment benefits.  As business owners we have seen a great reversal in prosperity in our businesses and seem to be taking the brunt of the costs of the Covid and the recession placed on us by this Administration's policies.  Like all the great storms we need to hunker down and hope that better days are coming soon. Good luck to all of you remember you are not alone.,political,Facebook

It is now easier to buy and own a gun in Texas than it is to Vote. Your right to vote is now under attack through restrictions that now tell you how and when you can vote. UNACCEPTABLE! It is okay for you to purchase a gun in our state without a background check but if you go vote you may be turned away. This is the strategy that our current leadership has decided to implement to hinder the vote for the people of Texas. Let's state the obvious our top leaders in Texas are Republicans and they are okay with suppressing the vote because DONALD TRUMP LOST! IT'S OVER! This has been verified over and over in both federal and state court proceedings all across the country.  It is vital that we organize and establish a presence in your communities. I urge you to reach out to your communities and let me know if there is a presence where you are so that we can address it. I have been traveling through all 254 counties in Texas and I try to call and send several emails to Democratic organizations in rural counties across Texas and our presence feels nearly obsolete.  Texas grew in population by nearly 5 million since 2010 most of this increase being Hispanics and minorities. This added 2 more congressional seats for Texas. WE HAVE THE POWER TO FLIP TEXAS. We can leave an impression on Texas that will last generations to come for our children's children and their children's children. Our voices can resonate in Texas and across the nation. But it will take all of us. Vamos!,political,Facebook

Election day is Tuesday! We wanted to send out a final message to voters that may still be considering how they will use their THREE school board votes about what we think this election is and is not about.  This election IS NOT a referendum on our public schools -- we know that our schools do a good job without being perfect.  This election IS NOT about whether you send your children to public or private schools -- many members of our PAC have had children in private schools.  This election IS NOT about school levies -- not every member of our PAC has always supported every school levy and nothing about this election obligates you to support future school levies.  This election IS ABOUT one thing: Do we want unqualified Trump-supporting radical conservatives running our schools? Thats what is on the ballot on Tuesday.  You can think our public schools have problems and send your children to private schools and dislike our property tax rates and ALSO REALIZE that electing Rennert Lynn and Drake is not the solution. Electing them is likely to result in giveaways to private interests and is likely to make our schools worse. It won't fix anything.  In fact at the end of the day what this election is really about is keeping MAGA off of our school board.  On Tuesday we hope you will join us in using ALL THREE of your votes for three of Malia Lewis Jodi Sourini Dan Heintz and Mario Clopton-Zymler for Cleveland Heights-University Heights School Board.,political,Facebook

Sleepy Joe stands up and reads the teleprompter claiming that he went above and beyond to get 100 million immunizations in 100 days. Well in 60 days. Psst Joe the Trump team was on that pace when you were illegitimately put in office. You did NOTHING!!!  By the way the claim you were ordering up to 800 million doses of vaccines check it out.

Is it possible to gaslight the entire country?  What do you get when you cross an insatiable desire for power raging hatred of anyone opposed to your agenda and a monumental lack of self-awareness? You get the modern democrat (Keystone Cop) party and their endless list of failed gaslighting and disinformation operations. Gaslighting and disinformation operations are similar in that both are used to create a false narrative. They differ in that gaslighting is an attempt to make us believe something completely different from the facts that we know and see to be true. Disinformation operations put out false information that we dont know to be false at the time. The Russia collusion hoax was a classical disinformation campaign as were the Kavanaugh hearings and the impeachment hearings of President Trump.  For those of you who dont know the term gaslight came about because of a movie by the same name released way back in 1944. The movie is about a husband who is trying to make his wife think she is going insane by telling her that things she thought were happening were not and that things she thought were not happening indeed were. This brings us to the current gaslighting projects by the democrats.  We are completely surrounded like fish in water by their gaslighting projects with the news media politicians and talking heads being the primary provocateurs. Take for instance the rioting and destruction that the democrats have encouraged promoted and funded. They have taken to going in front of any camera and making the claim that President Trump is the cause of the rioting. Now there is video evidence of President Trump offering any support needed to stop the violence in its tracks. Unfortunately many democrat controlled cities have refused his offer because they want to allow their cities to devolve into utter chaos. The democrats trying to blame President is like telling us that the Sun rises in the North and sets in the South. It is clear that democrat operatives are causing and perpetrating the violence and destruction including the assassination of police officers.  The latest gaslight operation to bring Trump down is the accusation that he publicly downplayed the dangers of the KungFluenza as he privately talked about how serious it was. One of the first responsibilities of a leader is to not instill panic so his comments were measured and responsible in that regard. The first responsibility of the democrats is to instill as much panic as possible so that the American people will willingly surrender as much freedom as possible to the democrats. Trumps comments measured as they were werent much different than those of health officials including Anthony Fauci that we heard with our own ears.  Now what did we see from President Trump? We saw him be the first world leader to ban travel from China and then from Europe and other hot spots. He mobilized the private sector to make available needed medical equipment that irresponsible state officials neglected to do. He held a daily briefing for the American people to stay informed about the progression of the disease and the progress on getting needed medical supplies and standing up mobile hospitals. While he was trying to instill calm his actions showed that he took the virus very seriously.  One of the funniest gaslighting operations to watch are the talking head panels on the left wing Propaganda Ministry networks. You should know that democrats use these panels for purposes of the appeal to authority. Viewers are expected to see the panelists as knowledgeable and wise and therefore are expected believe everything the panelists say. As each one makes assertions about Trump and America that we know to be lies the others are sitting there nodding their heads in agreement. The nods are supposed to impart to the viewers that what they are hearing is the consensus of the anointed. And after one of them says something spectacularly stupid that we are supposed to believe and there is that brief silence until another picks up the conversation I keep getting the sense that a punch line is coming just like at the end of any good joke.  We could go on and on here with different examples but I think you get the point. The problem the democrats have is that they are stuck in the past while living in an era of modern technology in the form of social media playback and satellites that can send information around the world the moment it happens. Leftist gaslighting operations cant overpower that. We can see for ourselves in real time who is doing what to whom and who is supporting it. We know which party is supporting the violence in our streets and which party is opposed to it. We know which party supports destroying the economy and which party supports strengthening it. Lastly we know which party believes in America and which party hates America. The age old communist and Nazi tactic of repeating a lie over and over until it becomes the truth simply no longer works.,political,Facebook
Typical of career corrupt politicians. Congressman Palazzo has been touting his term limit bill since he went to Congress. If he abided by the bill he has submitted numerous times his term would be up in 2022. Like most politicians they only say things to get elected. If he was honorable he would retire after his twelfth year. We know that like most career corrupt politicians he won't because he can't give up the power and money.  Press Releases Palazzo Re-Introduces Term Limits Bill f t # e Washington January 5 2017 | 0 comments Washington DC  Congressman Steven Palazzo (MS-4) re-introduced his legislation today H. J. Res. 17 that would impose term limits on Members of the House and Senate. The bill would limit members of Congress to twelve years of service six terms in the House or two terms in the Senate.  I personally believe our nation would be much better off if there were no career politicians. That is why I have introduced a term limits bill for the last three Congresses that forces politicians to go back home and live under the same laws they created knowing they will likely do less damage to our country and work more to improve the lives of hardworking Americans.  President-elect Trump and I are in complete agreement on the fact that we should have term limits in place. However my legislation allows lawmakers in both chambers to serve twelve years in order to ensure the balance of powers among the two institutions as specified in our Constitution. ,political,Facebook
"With the stroke of a pen to an executive order... at his golf club showing a privileged economic status ... even with Republicans in decent...TRUMP has further endangered Social Security and Medicare for all generations.  A payroll tax holiday does nothing for the millions of...

Recently a friend of mine was defending Liz Cheney and criticizing Trump and those that support Trump which is certainly his right to do.  For me Lizs diagnosis is simply: Liz is suffering from TDS and cannot focus on winning back the house. Personally I support president Trump because he points out weakness which is the primary problem with Republican leaders is the most pro-life president in my lifetime is not using politics for financial gain as many do and although rude and obnoxious at times always puts America and the little guy first. Additionally no other national leader has ever had the courage to demand school choice for every child in America which is critical for those like me who are only concerned for those that will follow us.  For me it is always policy over personality and honesty over slick political rhetoric. I respect who you support whether Liz or anyone else but for the future of mine and everyones children I hope the disruptor in chief trump decides to run again and God willing wins again.,political,Facebook
"From 2001 to 2009 Trump was a democrat. He became a republican in 2009. I think that he has seen both sides and knows the difference. One thing he knows for sure and does when necessary is fight the democrats like democrats. He is not like most of the rest of the spineless republicans who have still not figured it out that the democrats fight dirty and hard with no holds barred ! When the democrats "" fight their opponentsanything goes and nothing is disallowed or off limits. Identity politics name calling smearing demonizing propaganda misinformation changing positions multiple times double standards lying cheating and changing rules are just some of the methods democrats have used for decades. The fake news MSM sides with them and enables them in their methods. President Trump figured this out almost immediately and knew he had to fight back hard to preserve his presidency. The democrats controlling only one branch of government with a slight majority have had the republicans on the defensive for almost four years. The only real fighter against them has been The president. The democrats had false Russian collusion obstruction of justice phony quid pro quo bribery impeachment and much more and still have not been able to beat President Trump. God bless him he is a fighter for the country and The American People ! It is high time that all the republicans back the president and fight the democrats the way they fight their ""opponents"". The Senate Republicans have the power to help The President because they are in a majority and have the power to vote impeachment and numerous other powers. What else has to happen on top of all that I have described above for Republicans to not only fight back but to take the offensive for a change ! The democrats run circles around the always defensive nice guysrepublicans. Now include rioting burning looting and total violence against innocent citizens and total anarchy all by liberals and fascists encouraged by democrat mayors  governors and democrat politicians in all positions ? Vote by mail is another fraud being committed by democrats against the country ! Wake up Republican politicians It is time to fight fire with fire and help the country survive from four years of agony and distress. The ""good people"" need and deserve help.Decades of ""Kafka trapping"" has disabled you and you need to wake up from your stupor. You republicans and we Trump supporters hold the moral ground because the democrats have lost all morality and that too should encourage you ! The democrat MSM lies and makes fake news 24/7.  Start by immediately approving The ""lady Justice"" The President has appointed. He has every right to appoint her and you have every right to vote her in right away without allowing the typical gamesmanship and delays the democrats play !",political,Facebook

Is destroying America a winning electoral strategy?  A few years ago I was listening to a gun hating nut being questioned about his hatred of guns. He was posed with a scenario in which his home was invaded by a person who intended terrible harm to him and his family therefore would he not want a gun available in order to protect his wife and children from all manner of harm. I will never forget his response. He said that he would hide in the closet and call the police. It was then added to the scenario that the police would not arrive in time to save his family. As unbelievable as it was he continued to assert that he would hide in the closet and call the police and re-iterated his opposition to guns under any circumstance. The most basic duty of a father and husband is to protect his family with his life if need be yet he was willing to see everyone he loves destroyed before he would violate the rules of his ideology.  I think this story is important because it helps to provide perspective of leftist ideology in general and how that applies to what is happening in America today. This man no doubt loves his family dearly but the destruction of his family is far less worrisome for him than violating his ideology. If a man who loves his family dearly is willing to see his family destroyed in order to promote his ideology what do you think those who hate this country are willing to do to it in order to promote their ideology? Yes they too are willing to destroy it.  For leftist democrats which really means the entire democrat party because it has been taken over by the loons nothing is more important than their ideology and they are determined and always motivated to achieve power over everyone else. Their political philosophy has been described as a secular religion but it really isnt that. To describe it as a religion is an insult to religions. Theirs is a cult. A cult complete with the mindless chants of the Moonies and the destructive nature of Kool-Aid drinking zombies. They literally have taken to the destruction of every American institution that has made it the greatest country to have ever existed the most beloved most sought after for the hope of a better future and the most depended on to ensure a world free of world domination.  They are trying to create as much havoc as possible in all areas of life because they believe that President Trump will be blamed for it causing him to lose his bid for re-election so that they can usher in their leftist agenda which itself will make complete the destruction they have started. They have embraced the rioting looting and destruction of private and public property. They have embraced the violence that has resulted not only in bodily injury but also many deaths to law abiding citizens and law enforcement officers. They seek to drastically reduce the size of police departments or eliminate them entirely. They have been releasing violent criminals back onto the streets with no regard for the safety of law abiding citizens and some of these animals immediately upon having been released went right out and committed rapes and murders.  They are trying to destroy the economy using Covid 19 as an excuse. Typically the President in office receives the blame for a bad economy so they are trying at every turn to keep Americans locked down and businesses closed to the greatest degree possible. They have trampled civil rights closed businesses for so long that some will never reopen. The science is clear Covid 19 is particularly harmful to the very elderly and those in poor health. It is particularly harmless to all other especially children. But the science be damned they have an economy to destroy.  The democrats are trying to destroy our electoral system by doing away with our borders so that anyone can get in who wants in so that they can then be put on welfare and the voter rolls. They want to do away with the Electoral College which was created to make sure that every State mattered in national elections. They want to do a wholesale vote by mail scheme which will ensure voter fraud because ballots will be and have been mailed to the dead and to those still living who no longer live at the address on record. And no absentee voting isnt the same thing as the scheme the democrats want to put in place. Absentee ballots must be requested. Democrats want to send ballots out to every person registered to vote knowing that probably every precinct in this country has well over 100% of actual eligible voters on the voter rolls. If the election is close one crooked precinct or and handful of illegal votes can throw the entire election. Remember the 2000 presidential election? All of the things they want to do lay bare their fake concern about election integrity and voter rights.  They want to destroy the courts by expanding them with leftist judges who will decide cases properly..the left wing way. The courts are probably the most important target of leftists because they know their looney ideas will never come to fruition if it is up to the American people to decide so the courts staffed with leftist judges will be used to force their leftist agenda onto the American people.  They want to destroy Americanism and replace it with tribalism in order to keep Americans at each others throats particularly blacks and whites. Their obsession with skin color ethnicity and religion mirrors that of the KKK. Listening to their commentary that is laden with such references is full frontal evidence of their bigotry and racism.  They wish to do away with the so-called nuclear family a mother a father and children which is the most important institution known to mankind. The one thing that has caused the greatest harm to black families is the absence of fathers yet here is blm advocating for that very thing which is just another example of how black lives dont matter to blm.  This is just a partial list and are just the beginning for the totalitarian left. Make no mistake about it. It is their goal to ruin America for some grander scheme they want to put in place. Worldwide every one of these attempts to create a fair and just society by taking away freedom and personal property rights have failed completely. What makes these leftists so dangerous is their belief of their own superiority over all others just like the KKK. They are brainwashed brain-dead lunatics free of reason and logic who care about nothing and nobody except their ideology the ideology they want to force onto you. Government takeovers are always done by a very small minority of motivated actors who then gain control of the reins of power. There is a largely silent majority who must stop being silent.

SUPPORTERS OF THE RACIST TRAITOR IN CHIEF: QUESTIONABLE CHARACTER AND WORTH.  We the people with common sense decency and respect said back in 2016 during election that the Republican candidate that reality tv moron was nothing but a racist xenophobic homophobic corrupt and lying traitor. We said this often we said it loud we said it facts to show that we were saying was true and that if he were to win the nation would find itself in turmoil to say the least. But still people went ahead and voted for that repugnant individual and why did they vote for him? We have come to find out that the only reason they voted for such a person -of course this description is an assault to individuals- is because his divisive nature speaks to their own hateful and disgusting nature. Because there was no ideology in play that man sitting in the White House nowadays has never upheld conservative views he doesnt care about anything that Republicans uphold and just because he says it doesnt mean he does actions speak louder than words. He rambles on exaggerates uses beautiful big and wonderful to hide the fact that he doesnt know anything in reality and nothing to make anything great is really being done.  The narrow mindedness ignorance and worthlessness of those who voted for that trash will not be changed they are too stubborn to accept the truth and for that reason we reason we must from this moment on repudiate boycott and turn our backs on those who in spite of everything continue believing that repugnant man sitting in the White House is worthy of being reelected. From now on the standard by which to measure a persons worth is by finding out if they support that racist and lying traitor in the White House and if they are famous. we should boycott their movies tv shows albums books. These are some of those worthless individuals who are famous and support that disgusting individual in the White House Jon Voight Scott Baio Antonio Sabato Jr. Wayne The Rock Johnson Roseanne Barr Kanye West Gene Simmons John Ratzenberg Stacey Dash Clint Eastwood Ted Nugent Paul ONeill Dean Cain Kid Rock Robert Davi Johnny Damon Loretta Lynn Bob Knight Jesse James Dana White Mike Tyson Stephen Baldwin Gary Busey Teresa Gludice Dennis Rodman Lou Ferrigno Hulk Hogan Mike Ditka Tila Tequila Kristy Swanson Terrell Owens Wayne Newton Willie Robertson Ivana Trump Susan Sarandon. Surely there are more out there and as they are found; they should join the lines of those we no longer wish to pay money to watch in any way and preferable have their lives be ruined. And just as we boycott these supposed celebrities because if anyone researches these names they will realize that they arent at the top of their professions most of those on these list have been second rate performers who by chance had their 15 minutes of fame and lived their entire lives clinging to their flitting fame. A few in this list still enjoy a status of celebrity but after being known of their lack of integrity respect and intelligence surely they ought to be relegated to the status of pretty much unknown or so called had been  Now as far as family friends and those who we might meet in the future we do need to ask ourselves do I really want to be associated with such an individual do I feel comfortable sitting at the table with such a deplorable person to enjoy a meal or would I instead get up with a upset stomach for looking into the face of such questionable individual while eating?,political,Facebook

"To all : President Trump was a great American patriot and leader. His presidency was everything but dictatorial. His leadership was compassionate and smart and good for the country despite all the fake propaganda and demonization by the democrats and the fake news media. He governed with love of country and an America First ideology and not of party and partisanship and corruption. He placed the interests of the American people first and foremost. He was smart in dealing with foreign powers friends and foes included and brought respect and dignity to America. He brought back jobs that had been lost forever and created the greatest economy in the history of the country with record employment and growth for all including every minority group. He did this despite the greatest slander misinformation collusion and multiple coup attempts against his Presidency and his character and his administration. He did this despite one of the worst pandemics in modern history and constant barrage of attacks by the democrats and their allies in the fake MSM and despite two hoaxes of an impeachment and Russian collusion hoax.He created a vaccine in record time when everyone of his opponents made fun of him and ridiculed him. operation ""warp speed"" has saved tens of thousands of lives  if not millions in this country and the world. He was falsely called a racist antisemite Hitlerian dictatorial and many other derogatory names all as part of the attempt to cheat him out of a second term which he won by a landslide and millions of more votes than the votes of his first term election.History is not subject to the manipulations and machinations of the corrupt few and time will be the ultimate rightful judge of this man and his love for his country and people. The swamp and the deep state won but the majority of The American people know the truth and will not allow it to continue to rule for long. Many have been fooled and misled but the awakening is here and The People will take over their country from the greedy and the corrupt and powerful. God has always watched over America and its people because despite all its flaws and all its shortcomings it is the most democratic country in the history of mankind and a force for good and benevolence. It is no wonder everyone is trying to come here from all over the globe and whether they come legally or unlawfully they never want to leave.

Hello! I'm Michael and I'm running for Randolph Board of Education. I call my platform the #2040Plan in reference to the year that a child born on Election Day this year will graduate high school and head out into the world. When that day comes what sort of world will they face and how well will we have shaped that child to meet the challenges of tomorrow? I believe the answer to these questions depends on how we as a community address the following issues:   Technology  The pandemic was a crash course for us on just how much we can accomplish with technology. It also exposed how much we still have to invest in both the curriculum and infrastructure to create a fully integrated technology program that will prepare the students of today for the world of tomorrow. I've spent nearly twenty years in the technology industry and over that time have worked with organizations from small businesses to Fortune 50 corporations to build successful technology programs. My goal is to ensure that every student parent and staff member has the tools training and vision necessary to ensure that our children can thrive in the world of 2040.   Culture  Today's world is more diverse and interconnected than ever and tomorrow's world will be even more so. For today's children to thrive we as parents and educators need to do better at shaping children with a more worldly perspective. Our schools need a greater emphasis on language world history international relations and cultural understanding. My goal is to encourage movement toward a curriculum that treats all cultures with respect and teaches children to view their world and their interactions from different points of view. I support an open and honest conversation of current events based on facts and mutual respect and believe that our children can only benefit from learning to see the world with empathy and understanding for experiences outside of their own.   Talent  The continued success of Randolph's educational programs depends on fostering an organizational culture that attracts and retains the very best faculty. Like any other organization our district's greatest assets are its employees. Ensuring that faculty are free to focus on being the best educators they can be is among my top priorities. How we measure performance and academics from both a student and a faculty perspective is paramount to this effort. I will strive to ensure that the contributions of our faculty are identified and properly recognized. In fulfilling these promises I believe we can drive a culture of excellence and innovation that will guarantee our children's future success.   Transparency  School boards exist to represent the community's concerns to the administration and represent the needs of the district to the community. I believe that the board should consider the opinions and seek the community's advice and consent when dealing in matters of district policy and education. This role has never been more critical than it is now in the digital age when communications are more rapid and information flows more freely than ever before. As a board member I will work with my fellow board members to facilitate this process through all authorized means. No decisions should be made in the dark. No board should allow the personal ideologies of its membership to trump its obligation to be servants of the community. This sense of civic responsibility is crucial not only to the proper functioning of the district but also in setting the right example for our children to become good leaders amongst their own generation.  Finally I am poignantly aware that our community has been through a lot lately. I pledge to you that I will work to build bridges provide principled leadership and at all times be ready to listen empathetically. I have great faith that our community is as resilient as they come and that all of us simply want the very best for our children. Though we may not always agree we can never forget that we are a community and that all members of our community deserve respect. I therefore promise to maintain a respectful dialogue throughout this process toward the current Board members other candidates and the community. To at all times focus on helping Randolph heal the divisions that have threatened to tear us apart so that we can return to keeping our eyes on the future of our district and our children.  My door is always open and I encourage a public and transparent campaign among all candidates. Any resident is welcome to a private or public conversation on these or any other issues. I look forward to getting to know so many of you that I've not met yet and to giving my all to help ensure that our children receive the very best educational program we can provide.,political,Facebook

An Unlikely Hero  Four years ago I voted for Trump half seriously. Having been told that he had no chance of winning against his felonious rival. I had long ago distanced myself from liberal thinking as issue by issue I saw the faults and failings of that world view. As I would think is true for many people to me Trumps personality is abrasive. As an architect I would say the same for the style of his gold anodized aluminum buildings. Architects tend to make moral judgements about such things. Over the last three years and again issue by issue I have seen that the bad orange man has taken positive actions for the American people. Construction sites abandoned after the crash of 08 are finally resuming work. Foreclosed homes are being renovated and put back on the market. My clients that are mostly member funded non-profits have the confidence to start new projects. He has shown great courage in standing up for the most innocent and fragile human life. He has appointed more women and minorities to positions of power than previous administrations. Though censored by most media he has shown great compassion to those with severe disabilities and support for our veterans that have been all but ignored. Unemployment for minorities is at an all time low. He has taken decisive action on COVID19 and mobilized the private sector. I understand how he is loathed and hated. I was once among those of that mind set that placed style over substance and had a misplaced sense of security in a failed ideology and all encompassing government. I still dont like his buildings or personality but I have found him to be a hero of the people. An unlikely hero but a hero just the same.,political,Facebook

"The state of this world is getting scary. It's unfortunate that many do not see it.  Millions are marching around the world in protest every weekend against COVID-19 lockdowns vaccine mandates and the removal of civil rights liberties and freedoms. With at least a hundred thousand protesting in cities and towns around Australia.  ""If you forget the past you are doomed to repeat it."" ""I don't agree with what you say but I'll give my life defending your right to say it.""  Two very important statements the kids of today are not being taught. Free speech is something the whole world needs. Even racist hatred and down right evil things need to be allowed to be said. Gives us the opportunity to hit back through words NOT violence.  Let's start with Covid-19:  The fear being pushed by politicians and the media about COVID-19 is out of control. No I am not one of those that think COVID-19 is a hoax. COVID-19 is real. As I read once: Do I believe that people are getting sick? Yes. Do I believe that people are dying? Yes. Do I believe some hospitals are overrun? Yes. Do I believe nurses and healthcare workers are terrified? Yes. Do I believe China is lying about it's numbers? Yes. Do I believe COVID-19 was made in a lab? Yes. Do I believe China is responsible? Yes. Do I believe COVID-19 is being politicized? Yes. Do I believe COVID-19 is being used to strip Americans and Australians of their rights? Yes. Do I believe there's a bigger picture than what politicians and the media are telling us? Yes. Do I believe this is more about power and control than anything else? Yes. Do I believe we as Australians just set a dangerous precedent for our freedoms? Yes... and I am much more terrified of that than any virus.  Am I an anti-vaxxer? No I am 100% for vaccines. Myself and my family are all vaccinated for everything except for the COVID-19 vaccine. No I do not plan to get the COVID-19 Vaccine. I will not inject a vaccine into my body that is being forced upon me. Especially a vaccine that was ready in less than a year. It takes at least 5 years to fully test a vaccine. We do NOT know the long term side effects yet. I am Anti-MANDATORY vaccine I am not Anti-Vaccine. Take the vaccine if you want I support you decision to take it. But don't force it on me.  I do not believe in lockdowns or mask mandates. We lived with Influenza (a virus that had a confirmed 0.13% death rate for the years 2016-2017) for generations without mask mandates or lockdowns. I used 2016-2017 because they are the latest years where the numbers are confirmed: COVID-19 is far more deadly for over 60's than Influenza particularly those with underlying conditions with a death rate of about 0.66%. However When you account for elderly patients dying to COVID-19 without an underlying condition that death rate drops to 0.2%. Compared to the 0.08% Death rate for under 60's with COVID-19 dropping further the younger the bracket. The Delta variant is less deadly but more contagious. Please note I am talking about the death rate (Your chance to die if you get infected) not number of deaths. These numbers are based from the CDC's own words that 90% of COVID-19 cases will go completely undetected as most of the population is asymptomatic to the COVID-19 Virus. All this information can be found on the CDC website.  Now while the death rate is higher than influenza in the older generation. This is no reason to completely shut down a country even at the high end of 0.66%. No one wants to even talk about the rising rate of ""Self harm"" especially in teenagers due to lockdowns. These lockdowns are causing far more damage than they are preventing Not just in ""self harm"" rates. Source:  Next Abortion:  Abortion is getting out of control. The latest data from Planned Parenthood states that over 98%... YES OVER 98% of the reasons given for Abortion is ""Unwanted Baby"". Less than 2% is due to Rape / Incest. 2 reasons that are the only time I ever agree with Abortion and ONLY before a heartbeat. Source:  Both men and women need to take some responsibility for your own actions. If you cannot afford / want to bring a baby into the world then Wrap it Swallow it Flush it Throw it or just say no. But please STOP using Abortion as a contraceptive. Stop killing babies because you couldn't keep your pants zipped up. I accept that accidents happen but that's the risk you take when you say yes. Deal with the consequences of your actions.  And now for the US itself:  The US is being run by a senile dementia ridden old fart controlled by special interest groups in the hopes of turning America into a communist dictatorship. The Left leaning Mainstream Media is complicit in this they regularly distort the truth to push their own agenda. Notice they are not reporting on the Phone call between President Biden and the Afghan President Ashraf Ghani. A phone call that if it happened under President Trump He would be rightfully impeached before the media could even report on it.  In this phone call President Biden's own words pressured President Ghani to distort the truth: President Biden to President Ghani: ""And theres a need whether it is true or not there is a need to project a different picture."" Source:  This is not the first time President Biden has pressured another country to help him politically: Then Vice-President Biden with President Obama's backing threatened to withhold aid money if a prosecutor that was investigating the company Hunter Biden was working at was not fired. Source from then Vice-President Biden's own lips:   There are multiple other examples of corruption lies and propaganda by the Biden administration and it's buddies in the media. However this post will become a novel if I continue. Follow me for more examples in future posts.  And finally Australia:  Australia itself is sliding down a dark path. Our country is done as we know it if the population doesn't wake up and soon.  Queensland is opening a concentration camp in the center of the state. Source:  Victoria is the next communist China puppet state. Led by a known Communist supporter. Source: Multiple other articles showing the corruption of Daniel Andrews.  The Federal Government just passed a spy bill. Allowing them to access our phones and upload or delete data at will. Source:  The media around the world doesn't even care that Australia has begun a process to strip its citizens of what little rights we had. I fear that most Australians have forgotten what happened 80 years ago. We don't even have the means to defend ourselves any more they are scared another Eureka Stockade will happen.  It is time for Australians to take a stand. It is time for us to take our country back but we need help. We need the world to care about what is currently taking place in Australia.  Australia must ditch the crown. We must become a Constitutional Federal Republic. We do not have a Bill of Rights that needs to change. We deserve our freedom. But we must earn it first.

 Last week the Cranston Republicans put out a press release labeling the Cranston Democrats as leftist radical progressives.  Tell me was it radical when Democrats introduced legislation to waive penalties for those struggling to pay their city taxes or bills on time because of COVID?  Tell me was it radical when Democrats introduced a resolution condemning Donald Trumps attempt to eliminate funding for after school programs that support low-income residents of our City?  Tell me was it radical when Democrats introduced a bond proposal to combat climate change and finance projects to increase renewable energies and reduce our Citys energy costs?  Tell me was it radical when the Democrats found money in the FY20 and FY21 Budgets to increase funding for our schools?  You can hurl that label at me all you want but I will pick it up and wear it as a badge of honor. Im proud of our work and Im proud to be a member of a party fighting for a more just and equitable Cranston for everyone. ,political,Facebook
"Remember! 5th Excerpt  Remember when Trump did ""this that and the other""? Who can possibly recall all of this American disaster? Fortunately ""McSweeney's Internet Tendency"" has been recording them all along the path!  Following is their collection from a single month January 2019 two years into the Trump Administration.

But if you agree that it is important to share to make Americans aware we trust that you will. DA 2020  JANUARY 2019  564.  January 2 2019  In a cabinet meeting Trump said that Russia invaded Afghanistan in the 1970s to stop terrorists from entering the country. They were right to be there he said.

January 9 2019  Trump stormed out of a meeting with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer after the congressional Democrats said they would not back his proposed $5.7 billion border wall.

Because I knew he would say that and after Nancy said no to proper Border Security I politely said bye-bye and left no slamming!  566.  January 10 2019  In an impromptu news conference Trump denied ever saying Mexico would pay for his border wall. I never meant theyre going to write out a check he said.

January 12 2019  Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin five times over the course of two years but no detailed record of the conversations exist  even in classified files. The Washington Post reported that Trump went to extraordinary lengths to conceal what the two leaders discussed.  568.  January 14 2019  The Clemson Tigers football team visited the White House after winning the national championship. Previous White House celebrations for sports teams have featured elegant meals that highlight the best of American cuisine. Trump served them a candlelit dinner of McDonalds fast food still in paper wrappers.  569.  January 15 2019  A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to remove the question Is this person a citizen of the United States? from the 2020 census. The new question had been proposed by the Trump administration after prompting from then-presidential advisor Steve Bannon and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach appointed by Trump to lead a voter fraud commission.  570.  January 17 2019  Trumps former lawyer Michael Cohen admitted to rigging online polls during the 2016 campaign to make it appear as though the presidential candidate had more support than he did. Cohen said he acted at the direction of and for the sole benefit of Trump.  571.  January 17 2019  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was scheduled to visit troops in Afghanistan but Trump canceled her use of a military aircraft. The retaliatory move came after she urged him to delay his State of the Union address because of the shutdown.  572.  January 18 2019  A class-action lawsuit was brought against the Office of Refugee Resettlement. It accused them of working with the Trump administrations Immigration and Customs Enforcement to use children as bait to arrest immigrants who come forward to sponsor them.  573.

As Americans we seem to be drifting further apart every second of every day. The level of hatred can be felt almost anywhere you go in this country and its even worse online. People just dont seem to like each other anymore right? But why? Wars? Riots? Masks? Covid? Vaccines? Minimum wage? Abortion? Taxation? Trump? Biden? The Pope? Conservatives? Liberals? We could go on and on and   If you had a megaphone (or the virtual equivalent of one) and could speak to every single person in America at the exact same time what would your message be?  P.S. look no further than the comments on this post to get a flavor for whats happening in America.,political,Facebook

Warning this is a sarcastic post about Mitch McConnell.  I am seeing political ads by Mitch McConnell that are nonstop attack ads on Amy McGrath and her Liberal ideas without any ads proudly touting his policies.  Here is my idea for an attack ad that Mitch McConnell could run against Amy McGrath that would also demonstrate his commitment to Repealing and Replacing the Affordable Care Act/Obamacare:  ( The background pictures could show office doors being slammed shut in Kentucky as each topic is covered. They could be labeled: Protection Against Preexisting Conditions-Closed  PreNatal Care And Free Birth Control - Closed  Mental Health Counseling Access-Closed And Substance Abuse Counseling Access-Closed )  Amy McGrath supports Obamacare and wants to improve on it. She has flat out said it!  In contrast I Mitch McConnell  have enthusiastically led the fight to repeal Obamacare. I have been proudly working to end ACA/Obamacare since it passed in 2010. The bill to gut Obamacare was the Republican AHCA. The Republican American Health Care Act of 2017 or proudly called Trumpcare.  I voted for the AHCA to Gut Obamacare. Just after my vote to gut Obamacare the Congressional Budget Office issued its report saying 23 million Americans would lose healthcare coverage. That meant roughly 330000 Kentuckians. That bill would have succeeded in the Senate except for the Late Senator John McCain giving it the thumbs down. But lets review what this bill would have done to America.  I Mitch McConnell with that vote voted to remove protections against Preexisting Conditions that Obamacare enforced for all of us Americans.  I Mitch McConnell with that vote voted for the Insurance and Pharmaceutical Companies whose PACs donate huge amounts to my campaigns.  I Mitch McConnell with that vote voted to eliminate free birth control one of Obamacares 10 Basic Health Essentials and the very best way to prevent elective abortions by preventing unplanned pregnancies.  I Mitch McConnell with that vote voted to take Away control over their bodies from many Middle Class Working Poor And Marginalized girls and women who cant afford birth control. I Mitch McConnell did that with full knowledge of that impact. The side effect to my vote would be for more girls and women to seek abortions because I voted to take away free birth control.  I Mitch McConnell with that vote that would have eliminated the 10 Basic Health Essentials voted to reduce programs against the Opioid Epidemic. That vote by eliminating 10 Basic Health Essentials would have eliminated access to mental health and substance abuse counseling. Meaning that I Mitch McConnell with that vote voted to increase Opioid Addiction by taking away the tools to fight it.  I Mitch McConnell approve this message because by Repealing ACA/Obamacare I was glad to kick 23 million people off Healthcare including 330000 Kentuckians. And we all know because Amy McGrath is Too Liberal for Kentucky she will keep Obamacare and improve it!  (Closing picture shows all Doors closing at once.)  Full disclosure I Chuck Eddy Lifelong Moderate Republican proudly support Democrat Amy McGrath because Trumpian Republican Mitch McConnell and his voting record are bad for Kentucky.  Aaaaaand how would you like to be without Healthcare during Covid19? Aaaaaand for all of you people that lost Healthcare when you lost your Employer Health Insurance dont forget that Mitch McConnell has his orporare Donor$ Back$ but not yours. Please vote accordingly.  P.S. Amy McGrath is a 20 year Marine Veteran. For the past 36 years Mitch McConnell has been a Veteran Of Corporate Donors Fundraiser Dinners.  P.P.S. Dont forget that Mitch McConnell was SILENT at the same time Donald Trump was ignoring lying and Downplaying the Covid19 Pandemic. Trumps and McConnells pitiful ineffective inadequate and very slow response to Covid19 has now infected over 7299080 Americans as of today including Donald and Melania Trump. Trumps and McConnells pitiful ineffective inadequate and very slow response to Covid19 has now caused the deaths of 208191 Americans due to Covid19.  #VoteAmyMcGrath #DitchMitch,political,Facebook
"Have you noticed the absence of the obnoxious journalists & reporters since Biden got elected ? I am talking of the bought and paid for democrat operatives acting as news people like Jim Acosta & Jake Tapper & Brian Stelter & the Cuomo boy..........Chris Cuomo  just to name a few. They are absent because they know that everyone knows they are fake journalists. Questioning Biden like they questioned President Trump or rather harassed him with lies and misrepresentations would be too revealing of Biden and his spokespersons & their incompetence and lies & ineptness.They would make Jen Psaki look like the nut she is & the whole Biden administration would be exposed. They would lose favor & perhaps their jobs if they crossed who holds their leash. The democrats have such plants as fake journalists in all of the MSM including the NY Times and WAPO. They also control and dictate to their giant social media servants.These organizations are an arm of the corrupt democrat party. With Trump they were eager to create false scandals and crises but with Biden they cover up his major blunders and incompetence.Just take a look at the Afghanistan debacle and mess. look at the border crisis the inflation and the Covid mess. Look at the prices of food and gas. Look at the constant lies & all the other disasters in about 7 months ! If any of this was under Trump I think he would have been crucified and I mean literally crucified. They have no shame or honor to do a job well done with honesty and integrity. They have become perverted by the democrats & are a major part of the corruption. Once the media was the watchdogs over the politicians but now they are the lapdogs of the democrat party. The few mentioned above are just a few of many more fake journalist in MSNBC ABC NBC CBS  CNN LA Times NY times & WAPO and much more including FOX. I cannot forget to mention the stellar Rachel Maddow and Don Lemon & cute blinking eyes Anderson Cooper. There are too many more to mention but they are obvious to anyone who watches the media ! One of the greatest competent men to become president Donald Trump was trashed and demonized endlessly and a real corrupt demon Joe Biden has been lionized & made into a hero despite almost 50 years of constant failures & lies and deception. With the help of the fake & dishonest journalists and fake media & the corrupt democrat machinery & soulless activists Joe Biden was supposedly the winner of the Presidential elections. If you believe that Joe Biden got 80 million votes sitting in the basement you got to also believe that the famous ""Brooklyn Bridge"" was sold to 80 million people 80 million times. If you believe that I still have a bridge in Brooklyn to sell to you.",political,Facebook
FROM MOVEMENT TO MOVEMENT: But will there be change?  We are firmly in the transition away from the Trump era to the Biden era or so it seems. The Biden movement is a flashback to a former time: the growth era of a capitalist cycle which if it does not provide everyone's needs at least inspires belief in the possibility of meeting those needs. This is enough for most people. But in the U.S. we are in the dying stages of the capitalist order. Hope has dissipated competition has divided us into the haves and the have-nots.  Both the Biden movement and the Trump movement are reactionary movements: both wish to return us to a former place. The losing movement the Trump movement perhaps provides a glimpse of what lies ahead. It is afterall the child the outgrowth of the former idealized version of the capitalist myth which Joe Biden represents.  Joe Biden likes to speak of possibilities. Possibilities define his view of America. Foundational to this view is that these possibilities are rooted in the capitalist economic order. That somehow possibilities are not achievable in a state sector that somehow talent ambition ingenuity can only thrive when dollar bill's are waived in front of the participants this is the capitalist way.  Yet the same talent ambition and ingenuity exists without the lure of the dollar. Capitalism however has convinced us the fulfillment of these traits is only achievable when abundantly awarded through wealth and income. History however has taught us otherwise. Greatness is achievable through beliefs and incentives other than money. We need to look no further than the teacher the soldier the athlete the artist the nurse the social worker: most of whom are inspired by something other than money. These aspirants are inspired by other ideals and greatness is often achieved among them.  Biden's inaugural address was based on the ideal of cooperation. It was moving it was hopeful it is what many of us socialist have called for for many years: a cooperative world which seeks to meet the needs of all people. And herein lies the problem. While Biden calls for cooperation undoubtedly a sincere expression of his desires the Nation is wedded to an economic order based not on cooperation but on competition. Competition is foundational to the capitalist order; it is structural embedded in the financial framework of the private firm it is glorified it creates winners and losers.  Cooperation and possibilities are noble traits and inspirations but they are undermined by a capitalist ideology which glorifies competition and wealth. Cooperation which Biden seeks conflicts with the capitalist order. It is a great contradiction which we will need to adress otherwise the future will not look much differ than the present.,political,Facebook
The Dodger of USA. Trump dodged Vietnam he was afraid he could get injured in war. Trump dodged an interview with Mr. Mueller he was afraid he could have been caught in lies about the Russian interference in our 2016 elections favoring him. Trump dodged the allowing Attorney McGahn to testify to Congress he was afraid his obstruction of justice would be made public. Trump and Senate dodged Trumps culpability in bribing Ukraine to discredit his strongest political opponent. Trump dodged the Coronavirus as he underplayed the dangers of Virus and lost two months of preparation production of PPE and of providing a message to the country of protection Trump did not want to deal with issues that required empathy and caring concerns. The results of his lack of actions are of the countrys knowledge.

Sunday 28 March 2021  GOP Lawmakers Seek Greater Control  By Anthony Izaguirre  The Associated Press  Partisan takeovers of election boards. Threats to assess fines against county election officials and to overturn results. Even bans on giving water to voters while they stand in line.  In addition to their nationwide efforts to limit access to the ballot Republican lawmakers in some states are moving to gain greater control over the local mechanics of elections from voter registration all the way to certifying results.  The bills which have become law in Georgia and Iowa resurrect elements of former President Donald Trumps extraordinary campaign to subvert his loss when his backers openly floated the notion of having legislatures override the will of the voters and launched legal challenges against measures that made it easier to vote during the pandemic.  Its an overreach of power said Aunna Dennis executive director of the Georgia chapter of the voting advocacy group Common Cause. Theyre definitely trying to do an upheaval of our election system.  In a step widely interpreted as a way to check Georgias Democratic strongholds Republican Gov. Brian Kemp signed a bill Thursday to give the GOP-dominated Legislature greater influence over a state board that regulates elecwell tions and empowers it to remove local election officials deemed to be underperforming.  Other states are moving in similar directions. In Iowa after left-leaning counties sent voters absentee ballot applications in 2020 a recently signed law would bar election workers from sending the forms out unless requested. It threatens to fine officials for violating rules. A South Carolina proposal would give lawmakers new oversight of the members appointed to the currently independent State Election Commission.  In Arizona a Republican proposal that has since died would have allowed the Legislature to overturn election results and appoint its own Electoral College representatives. The Brennan Center for Justice a public policy group that supports expanded voter access tallied more than 250 restrictive proposals in the states many of them intended to roll back voting methods that were expanded because of the pandemic. That includes early and mail voting options both of which were popular among voters who sought to avoid virus transmission at crowded polling places.  Republicans have said the bills are meant to shore up public confidence in elections although members of the GOP have been the leading voices spreading baseless claims that the 2020 election was fraudulent.  There is universal agreement among experts that the election in which Republicans performed in congressional and state legislative races was free of widespread problems.  Georgias new law is among the most consequential for future elections. The measure will allow the Legislature to select the leader of the state election board and make the elected secretary of state a nonvoting member of the panel essentially sidelining the chief election officer who was picked by voters. The board could then remove local election officials and replace them.  This bill is a tragedy for democracy and it is built on the lie of voter fraud Lauren Groh Wargo chief executive of the group Fair Fight Action which advocates for greater voter participation said on a call with reporters. It means that radical right-wing legislators if they dont like how elections are being run in Quitman or Lowndes or Fulton or Dougherty counties they can wholesale replace those election administrators and put folks from the other side of the state in charge.  The new law also forbids local officials from taking financial grants to help run their elections narrows the window in which voters can request an absentee ballot and requires an ID to vote absentee by mail. It limits where ballot drop boxes can be placed and when they can be accessed. Giving food or water to voters waiting in line to cast ballots is forbidden. Georgia confirmed President Joe Bidens victory with three statewide counts of nearly 5 million ballots and there was no evidence of problems. They are tweaking the laws however they can to make it harder and to put up barriers for voters to stumble on Georgia state Sen. Jen Jordan a Democrat from Atlanta said at an event sponsored by the progressive group The NewDEAL.  The GOP also is cracking down on methods that counties used to increase participation and make voting easier during the pandemic. Republicans in Texas which has some of the most stringent election laws in the country are moving to ban curbside voting a method used in the last election by liberal- leaning Harris County which includes Houston.  Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds a Republican this month signed a GOP bill that closes voting sites at 8 p.m. rather than 9 p.m. shortens the window for early voting by nine days imposes new restrictions on mail and absentee voting and threatens civil fines and criminal charges against local officials who depart from state election law or guidance.  This is a total takeover of elections by the state said Linn County Auditor Joel Miller who was sued by the Trump campaign for mailing absentee ballot applications with some information already filled out to registered voters.tHat  Copyright (c) The Denver Post March 28 2021 edition.,political,Facebook

This is Trump's idea of Leadershit! DA2020  The New York Times  Tulsa Braces for Trump Rallys Health Threat as Virus Cases Rise  As the city reported its largest single-day increase in cases since March its top health official said he was absolutely worried that the Saturday rally could become a super spreader event.  Bruce Dart Tulsas top health official recommended that President Trumps rally be postponed until it was safer to bring large groups together indoors.  Bruce Dart Tulsas top health official recommended that President Trumps rally be postponed until it was safer to bring large groups together indoors.  Credit...Tom Gilbert/Tulsa World via Associated Press  By Annie Karni June 17 2020 4:55 p.m. ET  WASHINGTON  The message from Tulsas top government officials on Wednesday was not comforting.  Just days before President Trump was set to hold an enormous indoor rally expected to bring tens of thousands of people to the city the officials announced 96 new cases of the coronavirus the largest single-day increase in Tulsa since March.  And they offered little in terms of reassurance to residents worried about holding a large charged political gathering in the midst of a pandemic and on a weekend when demonstrations are planned across the country to honor Juneteenth.  At a rare news conference the citys top health official Bruce Dart said he was absolutely worried that Mr. Trumps rally on Saturday could become a super spreader event that would lead to more deaths.  Mr. Dart noted that he had recommended the event be postponed until it was safer to bring large groups together indoors and urged people over 60 who wanted to attend: Please stay home. Seek other ways to participate virtually.  Were in the middle of a pandemic Mr. Dart said. Coming together is a definite possibility of seeing increased infections and increased deaths from those infections.  Mr. Trumps campaign selected Tulsa in large part because the city is in Phase 3 of its reopening and many restrictions on daily life there have been lifted. Tulsa was seen as a perfect backdrop to send a message that the worst of the coronavirus crisis was in the rearview mirror.  Mr. Dart emphasized on Wednesday that this was not the case. So many people are over Covid but Covid is not over he said. Please stay the course.  The Tulsa police chief Wendell Franklin said he expected Mr. Trumps rally to bring into the city a mass amount of people that probably Tulsa has never seen before and noted that the weather forecast for Saturday was 90 degrees.  Prepare for hours and hours inside of a concrete jungle if you will he said.  Brad Parscale the Trump campaign manager said on Twitter that he had received 800000 ticket requests to the rally at the 19000-seat BOK Center calling it the hottest ticket ever!  On Wednesday the campaign announced a long list of campaign officials and lawmakers who would be traveling to Tulsa to serve as warm-up acts for Mr. Trump including Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio and Representative Elise Stefanik of New York. The campaign also appeared to be sending almost every black surrogate it has many of whom will be speaking before the president does.  But Mr. Franklin raised the possibility of mass protests. In Tulsa which in 1921 was the site of one of the countrys bloodiest outbreaks of racist violence Juneteenth protests are expected to be more intense because of Mr. Trumps decision to schedule a rally there on the holiday which honors the end of slavery in the United States and is celebrated as African-Americans Independence Day.  Facing criticism Mr. Trump last week said he would delay his rally by a day. But his visit will still coincide with planned protests and celebrations across the city all weekend.  Mr. Franklin said he wanted the protests to be peaceful. Lets have a safe and hopefully uneventful weekend he said.  But Tulsas mayor G.T. Bynum a Republican who is friendly with the Trump campaign said that despite the health and safety risks he was honored his city had been chosen to host the presidents return to the campaign trail and described himself as very grateful for the visit. He noted that the event would be the first presidential rally in Tulsa since President George H.W. Bush visited decades ago.  The fact that this president coming out of this event would single out our city and say thats a city that did it the right way thats a city thats reopening the right way and want to come here? Mr. Bynum said. I do take it as an honor.  But he added that any rational person looking at any large group of people would have concerns about the weekend and that it was up to rallygoers to wear masks and use hand sanitizer to reduce the risk.  As the mayor spoke the citys Facebook page livestreamed the news conference and was flooded with critical comments like  PROTECT YOUR CITIZENS #STOPTHERALLY.  Mr. Parscale has said the campaign will distribute masks at the venue. But campaign officials said they would not require people to wear them inside the BOK Center the indoor sports arena that signed a contract with the campaign to host the rally.  Attendees have had to waive their right to sue the campaign or the venue if they contract the virus at the rally.  When asked why he had disregarded the advice of his top health official to postpone the rally Mr. Bynum said that it was not his decision and that he did not control bookings at the BOK Center.  Mr. Bynum did not address the issue of the timing of Mr. Trumps rally which was widely criticized as an insult to black Americans. Instead the mayor called Juneteenth one of the most important days in the history of our country and said he was grateful for the increased awareness of the holiday this year.  He also said that he intended to greet Mr. Trump on the tarmac when the president arrived on Saturday but that he planned to spend the evening on the streets with the citys police officers.  Im not going to the rally he said.  Annie Karni is a White House correspondent.

The supply chain problems we are having is directly attributed to the reaction to the economic downturn caused by the COVID pandemic. Our government generally stimulates the economy through three methods all of which causes the debt to rise. The first method is to cut taxes to put more money in the private economy. Trump and the GOP did this at a time that in my opinion the economy did not need stimulus. It did make the economy grow but disproportionately benefitted wealthier Americans. The second way the government stimulates the economy is by giving cash directly to Americans. This is a very effective way giving the economy a quick boost but also causes overheating and can lead to shortages and inflation. Both the previous administration and the current one did this which helped prevent a recession. Unfortunately the Democrats doubled down on direct infusion and gave money to parents of young children who are the most likely to use it to buy things. This has caused a huge demand for products manufactured in Asia at a time that the shipping industry hasnt fully recovered capacity. Basically the supply line crises is caused by an economic policy that worked to well. The biggest problem with all of this money going out to parents is it has enabled them to not work. All of this borrowed money is going straight to manufactured goods from Asia while our Service Economy is struggling with a labor shortage. The third way the government stimulates the economy is by spending it on public projects like the proposed infrastructure bill. This type of stimulus is a slower but more measured way for money to be injected into the economy. In addition it has the added benefit of building enduring investments that help maintain the economy in the future.,political,Facebook

There's a video from earlier today of a person shouting slurs and harassing demonstrators in downtown Sonora. It's not an isolated incident. At the Trump rally someone threw eggs at attendees. Just a few days ago high schoolers were confronted by adults not with an appreciation for participating but disdain.  That type of behavior has no place here and I don't believe the actions of those lone individuals reflects on any substantial portion of this community  but it is representative unfortunately of what portions of our politics have become.  Yelling name-calling humiliating the other side. A few loud voices taking up all the oxygen. Win at all costs. We're good they're evil. We're American they're un-American. It's ripping us apart. It's the biggest reason the country is struggling to come together with solutions. Extreme partisanship is eating away at the foundation of everything we are.  This isn't a left or a right thing.  We as a community and a people need to come together and see our shared values. Politics isn't 'destroying the other side' or mocking them into submission. It's the process for electing leaders to make decisions for all of us and it's important. It's messy it's hard it's loud it's emotional but it's important.  Important enough to fight for the rights to demonstrate speak and assemble freely (without fear of attack coercion or harassment) to hold competitive elections and engage voters . . . these are good healthy things. That's people showing they care about what's happening.  We need a little more love and respect in that process and the level-headed voices and leaders on all sides to stand against it.  I stand against it and if you feel the same share it,political,Facebook
WHY RUN GREEN INDEPENDENT? I aim to assist in a transformation of American democracy to deconstruct the power structures of our two major parties and to promote the imperative of environmental stewardship as the foremost medium for economic growth and public health. The two parties that have reigned our government for centuries are not equipped to respond to socio-economic needs in a timely enough manner to make a difference when it counts. How long can we wait? More than $20 million dollars revenue annually could be realized by investing in offshore wind energy that could be sold to other northeast states. A Katahdin North Woods National Park would inject more than $100 million of recreation dollars into Maine. Ultimately no one party should ever have a majority of government representation because there is no one party that truly represents a majority of citizens. This democratic system is antique and outdated but the two are often the only choices we have. In House District 135 voters can break the cycle. Voting for me will not get Biden or Trump elected but it will signal to both Democrats and Republicans that an ecologically-focused perspective needs to be responded to with governmental action.

Please like and share with all you know...EVERY vote counts.  THE CASE OF THE ABSENT SHERIFF  I understand the importance of social justice. Border walls are ineffective.  Those were some of the first words that Mark Napier used in our conversation in October 2017. I was in his office that day to discuss the challenges he faced. He knew I was a lifelong Democrat who crossed the aisle to vote for him and he wanted to impress upon me that he understood the wave of reform he rode into office. Sheriff Napier wanted to assure me that the days of harassment and bullying in the Department where over. He assured me that he had a plan to fix wage issues for deputies and corrections officers. Sheriff Napier was polite articulate and engaging.  Since that time Sheriff Napier has been largely absent from the job. His written promises have long been forgotten. He has spent an inordinate amount of time being cozy with Washington politicians. His favorite deflection for his time away from Pima County is  If you are not at the table you are on the menu. He argued that his time working with Washington politicians including those that have put children in cages and diverted military defense funds to build border walls was necessary to protect Pima Countys interests. It has always been a dubious claim. For example Sheriff Napiers appeasement of federal authorities counted for nothing last year when DHS officials infamously rejected Pima Countys reimbursement for $200000.00 to house and feed asylum seekers. It appears we are on the menu nonetheless.  While absent from the office the Department continued to unravel with among other problems runaway attrition. Deputies and corrections officers voted with their feet when they learned that their reform Sheriff was not going to change anything. In most cases the officers either retired early or went to local law enforcement agencies with better pay and work conditions. When confronted with the crisis Sheriff Napier blamed demographics. At no time did he own the problem conduct exit interviews or try to determine the root causes. During the crisis he downplayed the impact on his jail (which was understaffed) and on response times (which increased).  For a time the runaway attrition resulted in a paper savings of many millions of dollars but there has been no analysis of the cost to replace those experienced officers. Retaining experienced and highly trained officers can be a net savings if done properly. A mass exodus is almost always more costly and inefficient.  Undeterred by this failure in leadership Sheriff Napier now claims credit for the paper savings. In the end whether you see blame or credit in the Departments current direction you should give it to the people responsible. When it comes to budgetary issues Sheriff Napier has relegated those tough decisions to the County Administrator. If anybody has saved money for Pima County taxpayers it is Mr. Huckelberry not our sheriff.  This brings us to the coming election. Over the last three years Sheriff Napier has made no secret of his affinity for the Trump administration and its policies. Now however with the Presidents political fortunes in doubt Sheriff Napier is trying to turn the page and once again wear the mantle of a reformer. However Sheriff Napier refuses to publicly denounce the most abhorrent policies and words of Trump himself. Bottom line: if you like Donald Trump you should re-elect Sheriff Napier. If not you will want to make a different choice. Personally I already know enough. I will not vote for a man who wants to pose as a tough border sheriff while neglecting the fundamentals of running his Department.  Stephen T. Portell Attorney,political,Facebook
AN AMERICAN NATIONALIST VOTING INDEX Speaking Softly  Biden -2.5 Trump +1.5  While Theodore Roosevelt often engaged in bellicose rhetoric his foreign policy while president relied more on negotiation and adroit diplomacy to advance American interests. For example Roosevelt relied on his diplomatic connections more than military power in avoiding an intervention by Germany in Venezuela to collect overdue debt. TR knew US foreign policy needed to change to adapt to new challenges. In his time it had to adapt by becoming more active in the world.  As I mentioned in my posts on the History and Future of Nationalism the world has changed again. The pursuit of liberal hegemony since the end of the Cold War has proven to be unsustainable. Meanwhile the rise of China Russia India and other regional powers ushered in a dynamic multi-polar system. Trumps election in 2016 was a repudiation of the liberal model. Much of the change since then has been simply talk but talk in foreign-policy can also be substantive. Nevertheless foreign policy remains one of the sharpest contrasts between the two candidates.  Realist Foreign Policy  As I have argued previously the new National Security Strategy promulgated by Trump in 2018 is one of the most important and least understood changes in modern American foreign policy. It rejects the globalist liberal crusade to spread Western values throughout the world and expressly adopts the realist strategy which holds that international relations is a contest among nations especially great powers and that Americas only foreign policy goal should be to preserve its own national security and way of life. The text has its flaws but it remains a watershed moment in recent history. Trump deserves a +1 for this achievement  In contrast Biden supported the liberal globalist model in the Senate and as part of the Obama Administration. There are encouraging signs that some of his current advisors recognize the failures of this strategy as discussed in an article from the DefenseOne website. However both Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris still focus on human rights rather than the real economic and geopolitical dangers we face. Thus a Biden-Harris Administration would most likely return to the liberal model and so deserves a -1 rating.  NATO Expansion  The American commitment to NATO is based the post-World War II socioeconomic weakness of Europe in the face of looming Soviet Communist expansionism. It is past time to reduce our commitment since Europe now has the capability to defend itself against Russian aggression. President Trump has talked about this but his substantive policy has been quite the opposite. Much handwringing occurred when the administration announced the withdrawal of 9000 troops from Germany. However instead of coming home they are destined for redeployment in Poland. Moreover we agreed to admit North Macedonia a tiny remnant of the old Yugoslavia to NATO and thus to defend it even though it has no relationship to any real threat to the US. Trump thus has failed to accomplish anything of substance in this area and deserves a zero.  However Bidens stated policy is worse. As the DefenseOne article mentions he supports releasing Europe from the goal to increase their defense expenditures to 2% of GDP in exchange for cooperation on China and Middle Eastern issues. This ignores the fact that Europeans have very different views on those issues. This would allow them to piggyback on our defense support while giving up little in return. It thus earns Biden another -1.  Withdrawal from the Middle East  Perhaps nowhere has liberal hegemony failed so disastrously as in the Middle East. Rather than attempting to solve its centuries-old intractable problems we should be supporting the development of an internal balance of power and become simply an offshore balancer (see this previous post). Unfortunately neither candidate embraces this approach. Trump abandoned the JCPOA with Iran that controlled its nuclear development and instead threatened military action. He has reduced but not eliminated the number of combat troops in Syria and Afghanistan. On the positive side the administration engineered the recognition of Israel by the UAE and encouraged its tacit alliance with Saudi Arabia. This lays the groundwork for a balance of power in the region between an Arab-Israeli coalition vs. Iran. However the lack of strategic coordination between all these policies earns Trump only a zero on this subject.  Meanwhile Biden supports trying to renew the JCPOA but calls Saudi Arabia a pariah state. While supporting military withdrawal from Afghanistan and the Middle East in principle he then conditions it on effective control of Al Qaeda and the Islamic State. Immigration and economic sanctions would be as effective in preventing them from attacking the US. Bidens approach does nothing to achieve a realist solution in the region and thus earns him a zero as well.  China  China presents a multifaceted geopolitical trade and domestic challenge. President Xi Jin-Pengs increasingly totalitarian rule and bid for world power came as a shock to globalist elites. It would not have surprised anyone with any knowledge of Chinese history and culture. President Trump rightly alerted the world to the danger and has successfully controlled some of their influence notably through his campaign against Huawei. However he has failed to build the global consensus necessary to effectively contain the threat. He rates a +.5 for his efforts.  In contrast Biden has minimized the threat and was part of an administration that navely coddled China and allowed the US to become dangerously dependent on it. The DefenseOne article suggests that his advisors now realize these errors and accept the need to respond. However given the former Vice-Presidents past attitudes he must be assigned a -.5 on this issue.  Conclusion  There is no question that there are fundamental differences between the philosophies of the two presidential candidates on foreign policy. Biden has been part of the globalist establishment for years while Trump has challenged it though often by word rather than deed. A future strategy must be based on the realism and restraint  speaking softly not primarily by force  to be both sustainable and successful in the 21st century world.

Give the Biden administration and his so called VP border czar Kamala Harris the most trivial photo opportunity and they will run with it. The fake news media traitors are right there to help them in their propaganda. Millions of migrants are trying to cross the border living in squalor & filth but now the administration deflects the whole border crisis by some border patrol police on horseback trying to do their job! Now its whipping migrants and how cruel they are. Does not matter that videos that they try to hide show thousands of unvetted migrants with or without COVID being let free to enter the country. Does not matter that they could be terrorists without any background checks coming in to commit more terrorism. This imposter got into office by cheating In a completely rigged election & he is a complete incompetent fraud ! He has selected other complying fraudsters such as Blinken & Mayorkas & Psaki just to name a very few. Mayorkas said we saw horrifying images  painful to watch with the border patrol. It is important to note that not one person was hurt ! There you go thats the border crisis men on horseback doing their job not millions pouring illegally in. This senile man Biden is a charlatan who lies constantly & has his people perpetuate the lies with the complying news media with no integrity & full of corruption. It seems like a scam has been perpetuated on the American people for almost 5 years culminating in the fraudulent  selectionof Biden. Amazing how millions of people are accepting of this either through ignorance or indifference or because of failed ideology. A reminder for the  prveleged white supremacists racists  irredeemables & deplorables : January 6th was as bad as Pearl Harbor & 9-11-2001 ! Maybe worse ! The broken system is the reason for the border crisis the Taliban are the reason for the disgusting failed Afghanistan withdrawal and everything else is Trumps fault ! This is the Biden administration for you. Shameful & disgraceful incompetence ! We could not have a more dangerous enemy if we tried,political,Facebook
#LettersInSupportOfVillanueva  To the Los Angeles Times editor: Villanueva has committed the sin of rebuking a Democrat. How dare he accuse Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti of an inept response to the homelessness crisis? (Except that its true.)  Villanueva ran for office in 2018 at a time of heightened anti-Trump sentiment. Then-Sheriff Jim McDonnell was perceived as collaborating with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement or ICE when the Trump administration was conducting surprise raids in L.A. County.  Villanueva vowed to throw ICE out of county jails if elected. He won the election and has indeed banned inmate transfers to ICE custody.  Villanueva is direct confrontational and all over the map politically. He has publicly celebrated Pride Month but at the other end of the political spectrum he has promised to allow more permits for carrying concealed guns.  He seems to be a maverick rather than an ideological loyalist. If that bothers progressives who expect loyalty to their agenda they had better find someone else.

What is court packing?  Most of you have heard the ruckus over allegations that Joe Biden will pack the courts if elected and he wont deny it when questioned. Many of you may not know what exactly that means so this is for you. The idea of court packing may go all the way back to the founding of this great country but its most prominent iteration occurred in the 1930s while FDR was president.  FDR had a big problem during his presidency with the courts because they were regularly declaring his New Deal actions and programs to be unconstitutional. This was back when the courts still had some sense of self-control when it came to judicial activism. As a result of all of the push back by the courts against his unconstitutional New Deal actions FDR proposed adding one new justice for each justice that was over seventy years of age which at the time applied to six justices. So the court could have ended up with fifteen justices.  This was an attempt by FDR to appoint justices who would ignore the Constitution and would instead decide in his favor. However politicians on both sides of the aisle came out in force against his plan and it never saw the light of day. It appears that even though his plan was refused by Congress the threat itself was enough to get the Supreme Court to start declaring his unconstitutional actions as constitutional. The change in the courts voting behavior became known as the switch in time that saved nine.  So court packing is the action of altering the established form and function of the courts by appointing justices who are political activists in order to shift the balance of power to a particular side. Joe Biden said a day or two ago that President Trump is packing the courts and that it is unconstitutional. Joe Biden doesnt know what planet he is on much less what is constitutional or not. President Trump is filling vacancies and there is nothing unconstitutional about that.  Court packing exposes the much greater problem that the courts to steal a line are simply politics by other means. The courts have been used as a tool by politicians since the founding of this country but it went into hyper-drive in the 1930s. The courts have been given too much deference that has allowed them to exercise judgement and power over things the Constitution or subsequent amendments have not provided them. The courts largely have become a joke and when they exceed their authority there is a remedy and that remedy is to ignore them.,political,Facebook
From the desk of Bishop E.W. Jackson Sr.  Dear Fellow Americans (of African descent):  I write to you with great concern for the future of our country and the black community. Like most Americans I too am angry over the killing of George Floyd. His death was a monstrous act and former police officer Derek Chauvin deserves to have the full weight of the law brought against him. If the video we witnessed is accurate Mr. Chauvin must be imprisoned for a long time.  However my sadness reaches well beyond this single tragedy. The riots looting and violence which have occurred in cities across the country will not reform heal unify or improve the lives and safety of black Americans. In fact these actions are radically regressive and self-destructive.  Black businesses are burned down the owners are assaulted and essential grocery stores and pharmacies are destroyed. Cops and innocent bystanders are victimized and killed. The irony is that the victims are primarily those for whom the rioters claim to be seeking justice. History teaches us that communities wracked by riots and looting do not recover easily if at all. They tend to become more impoverished and dangerous than they were before the upheaval.  The Proverb says where there is no vision the people perish. The last time curfews were necessary to quell violence across the country was fifty-two years ago in 1968. A half a century later we face the same destructive reaction to racial grievance. It will not lead to one black child getting a better education. Not one black worker will get a better job and not one inner-city family will live in a safer community. If police departments are defunded as Black Lives Matter is demanding look for an outbreak of crime and violence in the inner city like nothing we have ever witnessed before.  The purpose of peaceful protests should be to secure a better life for those trapped by inner-city violence drugs gangs and lack of educational and economic opportunity. If we are having the same violent protests over the same issues with the same negative consequences as 50 years ago something is wrong with our approach.  There is a way out of this vicious cycle but it is hard medicine. Black citizens must stop voting for a political party that espouses nothing more than racial demagoguery. Al Sharpton a proven charlatan with zero credibility is trotted out to speak for the victims. No solutions are offered and no long term progress is ever made. Social and racial justice are popular slogans but they are not a strategy for improving the lives of people.  Education has been used to uplift every demographic group that has come to America. However inner-city children whose ancestors are among the earliest to arrive on this continent are trapped in failing schools. Educational choice offers a real solution but black Democratic politicians block it at every turn. They send their children to the finest schools available while leaving the children of their constituents trapped in dead-end institutions.  Their betrayal doesnt end with education. These black politicians go to church every Sunday and some of them are pastors. Yet they disregard the sin of abortion and its impact on the black community. Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger was a rabid racist who admired Adolph Hitler and consorted with the Ku Klux Klan. She would have liked to exterminate black people but satisfied herself with suppressing the growth of the black population through abortion. When eugenics proved unmarketable she changed her brand to planned parenthood which sounds benign unless you know the truth. With the full cooperation of many black leaders Sangers genocide against the black community continues to this day.  Finally the single greatest social problem facing the black community is the destruction of the nuclear family. The out-of-wedlock birth rate has exploded to 72%. In some cities such as Richmond Virginia it is 80%. The young men born to single mothers unwanted by their fathers grow up with anger and abandonment issues. Desperately wanting to be wanted they are easy recruits into a brotherhood of gangs crime and violence. The streets are an outlet for their anger.  Leftists complain that the criminal justice system tracks young black men from the school house to the jail house. But the progressive welfare policies of the Democrat Party put them on that track. Instead of encouraging stable two-parent families they incentivize single female-headed households. Theyve been doing this since the 1960s with horrific results.  Where is the plan for reversing the crisis of these communities? Where is the vision for a better future? Democratic leaders have led the black community to the brink of destruction with no hope for a better life. The black Democrat elites on the other hand experience the best America has to offer while leaving their fellow black citizens utterly hopeless.  Living posh lives these so called black leaders and their white leftist counterparts tell black voters to hate and fear Donald Trump because he is their problem. He is the enemy. His rhetoric does at times make it easy for them to mischaracterize him. Nevertheless Donald Trump has accomplished some remarkable things to benefit the black community. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) have faced financial hardship for decades and he is the first president to provide a permanent funding solution.  He established Opportunity Zones for the inner cities to help spur economic development. He presided over an economy that saw the lowest unemployment rates ever for black and Hispanic Americans. He shepherded the Criminal Justice Reform Bill through Congress correcting the legacy of the Clinton era overreaction to the crack cocaine epidemic.  President Trump is actually doing something about the problems the black community faces while Democrats do nothing.  Democrats hope that if they can keep black voters fixated on hating Donald Trump and the boogey man of racism they wont notice that the leaders they elected and the party they support are doing nothing. The voters wont notice that over 7000 young black people die in inner city violence every year. They wont notice the failing schools or the dropout rates. They wont notice the the continuing decimation of the nuclear family once the bedrock of the black community. The black Democrat politicians do not want black voters to notice that they are enriching themselves with blood money from Planned Parenthood. That organization kills around 400000 black babies every year. The black population would be double what it is today were it not for the abortion industry and the Democrats they pay to keep quiet about the genocide.  It is time for black citizens to turn away from such corrupt leaders. It is time to denounce the rioting violence and the anti-Christian philosophy of the Democratic Party which is only destroying black people.  We must come together with other citizens around a vision for the future of our community and our country that is rooted and grounded in faith. Weve come this far by faith but Democrats would have us burn the bridge that brought us over. That is suicide.  As America goes so goes the black community. Black veterans fought under the same American Flag and took the same oath to the Constitution. While they did not always receive the respect and gratitude they were due it is nonetheless true that no people of African heritage anywhere on earth are more free or better off than we who are blessed to be Americans. America is still the last best hope for all of us regardless of race.  We cannot change the past. However we can change the future. It is time to come together across all racial and cultural lines to renew the American vision of one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all. It is within our grasp if we do not allow the radical elements among us to destroy it forever. We are at the precipice. There are those who would like to push us over the cliff into chaos. They think they will be there to pick up the pieces and create a socialist utopia but history proves it will be a totalitarian nightmare.  Let us as free black Americans pull back from the precipice push back against the anarchists and embrace the legacy of freedom justice and hope for ourselves and the generations to follow.

From 2000 to 2007 under George Bush 491000 Americans died from the flu or pneumonia. From 2008 to 2015 under Barack Obama 393000 Americans died from the flu or pneumonia. Both are respiratory illnesses with basically the same symptoms. The major difference is pneumonia can be caused by bacteria or fungus as well. Masks can help prevent the spread of both illnesses. There are vaccines that can reduce the chances of getting both illnesses. Socially distancing is also effective.  President Trump and the task force have encouraged social distancing and masks for everyone and quarantine for those that are ill. PPE and ventilators have been manufactured and distributed at a record pace. Multiple vaccines and even some therapeutics are set to be ready in record time. Plans to distribute the vaccines rapidly using the U.S. Military have been made. The President is now working to make Regeneron the drug he was given available for emergency use to all Covid patients throughout the nation at no cost. The most vulnerable will have the opportunity to receive a vaccine first.  You might say that you wanted to see President Trump wear masks more often. You might say he shouldn't have rallies. You might find a hundred reasons he hasn't handled the virus the way you think he should have. You'll probably say the point I'm about to make doesn't count because Covid-19 is more contagious and kills more people. But I would argue that 61000 people dying each year over an 8 year period is an incredible number of lives.  So from 2000 to 2015 884000 Americans died from the flu or pneumonia under the leadership of George Bush and Barack Obama. Neither of them came close to the response that Trump has made against Covid-19. There were no warnings to social distance wear masks or quarantine. In fact there were no warnings at all from President Bush or President Obama. There was also a stint with the swine flue that Obama did little to address. Thankfully we all got lucky with that one.  Is it because fewer were dying from these illnesses each year than from a virus like Covid-19? Was losing 61000 lives each year to these two illnesses just an acceptable number? You can be certain that it wouldn't be if Trump was the President. Understand the deaths from Covid-19 are terrible but the blame doesn't fall on President Trump. If it does then the blame for the 884000 deaths from the flu or pneumonia between 2000 and 2015 falls on Presidents Bush and Obama.,political,Facebook

"THE LONG ARC OF RACISM  The insurrection by anti-government white nationalists on January 6th was 12 years in the making beginning with Obama's election in 2008.  Americans spent the beginning of the 2000s focusing their hatred on Muslims launching two ill-fated wars in an attempt to reassert its global dominance. As America's military might floundered in the Middle East its economy imploded after decades of stagnant wages conspicuous consumption and deregulation came home to roost. Then the unthinkable happened.  A Black man was elected president.  Racists rallied to the call.  Obama was surely not a legitimate president. He wasn't even a legitimate American!  Tea parties gathered decorum was cast aside (e.g. ""You lie!"" yelled at the State of the Union) and fragile white Americans were soon able to excuse their every failure and soothe every insecurity as the consequence of Obama's election.  The Republican party rallied the support of ""angry white men"" to help ""keep them in business"" and Donald Trump rode that wave of amorphous bigoted ignorant rage to the White House.  White nationalists had their president and he considered them ""very fine people."" The arc of American decay that Republicans often infer began with the Voting Rights Act and hastened thereafter had reached its nadir with Obama's election and Trump was finally making America great again (wink wink).  But his God-given presidency was about to be cut short by of all things Black voters in cities like Atlanta and Philadelphia who dared exercise the very rights that brought the cultural decline of America nearly 60 years ago.  Despite weeks of calling for violence Trump's white nationalist supporters were welcomed to Washington DC in a manner that stood in undeniably stark contrast to that which Black Lives Matter protesters received 6 months earlier. Where BLM were met by the National Guard in tactical gear on the steps of the Lincoln Monument Trump's racist insurrectionists were allowed to run wild all the way into the Capitol and onto the floor of the Senate.  Americans soothed themselves saying ""this isn't who were are!""  Yes it is.  It is who we have always been.  Angry.  Fragile.  Entitled.  Violent.  and  Racist.  Trump's defeat doesn't fix these problems or heal these wounds.  Black voters saved America from Trump.

"Dear Fellow Patriot. Is Elaine Luria Nancy Pelosi's and the gun-grabbers' favorite U.S. Congresswoman? Elaine Luria is endorsed by the anti-gun Giffords organization. And Michael Bloomberg spent nearly a half-million dollars to elect Rep. Luria. Pelosi's network of PACs dumped in millions to help turn this deep red seat blue during the 2018 midterms. But it doesn't have to stay that way! With Elaine Luria running for re-election this year this is our perfect opportunity to unseat her!  Let me say it again. Elaine Luria is Nancy Pelosi's and Michael Bloomberg's favorite U.S. Representative and we have a chance to DEFEAT her.  I have a plan but I'll need your help to get it done. But first let me explain just how much is on the line. Because you see Elaine Luria is a critical piece of the Democrats' plot to block every conservative reform on President Trump's agenda. Not only that but House Democrats are STILL talking about their failed impeachment hoax. Right now the Republican majority in the U.S. House majority is currently held by Democrats and they are not letting up. They are determined to build on the momentum of their victories in the recent mid-term elections. Every subsequent loss we suffer at the hands of the Democrats lowers our chances of creating lasting conservative change during the Trump Presidency. And with the Republican Senate Majority at a bare 51 seats things are growing desperate. The Democrats are counting on their favorite gun-grabbing House Rep. to hold onto this traditionally Republican seat while they try to win 4 Republican U.S. Senate seats up for grabs in November. You see it's vital Virginians win back this seat and take his political power off the board. And I'm the man to do it. I need your help to do it. But first let me tell you a bit more about myself. My name is Jarome Bell. Im an America First conservative Navy Veteran and high school football coach running for Congress to fight with President Trump to put America First. I am the proud father to three children and I've been married for 23 years and counting. I am a U.S. Navy veteran of 27 years where I flew more than 9000 hours as a Naval Air Crewman. As a Candidate for U.S. House I'm fighting in this campaign to protect Virginians from Elaine Luria's big-government left-wing agenda. And as a U.S. Congressman I WILL fight to protect the Constitutional rights of Virginians at a national level. Democrats have voted to keep ObamaCare. I will lead the fight to roll back ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion in Virginia -- even against the will of several in party leadership. Where Elaine Luria votes with Pelosi to give Planned Parenthood millions in taxpayer dollars I will vote to defund Planned Parenthood. Where Elain Luria has voted with billionaire gun-grabber Michael Bloomberg for gun control I will continue to fight for our Second Amendment rights. Ultimately Elaine Luria votes in lock-step with Nancy Pelosi's progressive agenda EVERY TIME -- and I'm ready for that to end. But we need a Republican who can defeat Nancy Pelosi and Elaine Luria. ________________________________________ ""Our country desperately needs courageous leaders like Jarome Bell to stand up to the establishment in Washington."" U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) ________________________________________ But to unseat a powerful incumbent Senator like Elaine Luria I'm counting on the support of conservatives like you. That's why I'm launching a Defeat Nancy Pelosi Money Bomb and sending you this message today -- I need your help to hit our $100000 goal before my rapidly approaching primary election on Tuesday June 23rd. Will you join the fight to DEFEAT Nancy Pelosi by agreeing to a generous donation of $250 or $100 now? I know that may be a sacrifice for you but we can't afford to have a representative as liberal as Pelosi's pal Elaine Luria. You see pro-abortion groups NARAL and Planned Parenthood Action rate Elaine Luria at 100% in lock-step with their pro-abortion agenda. After taking nearly $500000 of Bloomberg's dirty money Luria no doubt wears her 'F' rating from the NRA like a badge of honor. The Heritage Foundation rated Luria's record go so far left that they rank her at 00.00% -- one of the most liberal scores in the U.S. House! You heard that right Elaine Luria is more liberal than nearly every other Democrat in the U.S. House. So please chip in with your donation of $100 or $50 today to send Pelosi's and Bloomberg's favorite House Rep. packing! If you're reading the headlines then you already know conservatives like you are uniting to back my race against Elaine Luria. My defense of the Second Amendment in Virginia's Second Amendment Sanctuary Movement racked up hundreds of thousands of total views from conservatives nationwide. And I've garnered support from noted conservatives like Rep. Paul Gosar and Michelle Malkin both of whom have endorsed my race to defeat Elaine Luria. The bottom line is this: I'm the Republican candidate most likely to beat Elaine Luria head-to-head in November! It's clear my campaign is uniting Virginia conservatives to defeat Elaine Luria. But I need support from patriots like you to mount the campaign necessary to unseat him. We already know that Elaine Luria has Nancy Pelosi's and Michael Bloomberg's support and the rest of the liberal elites will fight us every inch of the way to avoid losing one of their own in the House. So please join the conservatives rallying to DEFEAT Nancy Pelosi and Elaine Luria by pitching in $50 or $25 right away. I know that for many people a gift of $10 or $25 is a significant sacrifice to make. But perhaps you have the means to contribute the maximum legal amount of $2800 ($5600 per couple) to support this fight to DEFEAT Nancy Pelosi and Elaine Luria. No matter the size of the contribution you feel led to give your donation of any amount will be a tremendous boost. So please chip in today with $10 $25 $50 $100 or whatever else you may be able to afford. I'm asking you to do this because -- above all else -- we must be able to fully fund our proven four-pronged campaign plan of: 1. Data-driven mobilization consisting of targeted emails direct mail and phone banking. 2.

Dedicated field staff in every corner of Virginia's 2nd district -- from the eastern short to the Northern Neck and Hampton Roads. 4. Hard-hitting TV and radio ads all designed to ignite support from conservatives across Virginia. In a federal level effort like this every contribution is crucial to our victory. And when we win we will have accomplished so much! Not only will we have ousted Elaine Luria from her seat of power in the U.S. House we will have dealt a blow to the entire Democrat Party's agenda to seize control of Congress! So please join this fight immediately and contribute $250 $100 or whatever you can afford to DEFEAT Nancy Pelosi and Elaine Luria. If you will give me your support in this fight I pledge to do as I have for my entire career: defend our conservative values. You and I will start by defeating Elaine Luria.

Flies Lies and Rolling Eyes  What better description to sum up the Vice Presidential Debate? How incredibly telling that the fly on Pences head received more attention than the answers or lack thereof by the candidates albeit lacking the petulant child banter.  So what did we learn? Senator Harris defense mechanism is condescending and exaggerated tones and gestures. Had she the ability to control her emotions her arguments would have resonated better with her audience. Although I would imagine the younger constituents were sitting on their couches cheering her on as she let Pence have it. Ironically with as much talking as she did I didnt hear her say anything of substance. What are their plans for COVID that arent already being done? Are they going to pack the Supreme Court? Are they repealing all of Trumps tax breaks not just those making over 400k per year? These are serious question that deserved answers.  We learned that VP Pence can stay level headed even if the face of adversity. All kidding aside how many of us could have sat there with a fly on our head and not flinched or swatted at it? How many of us could have kept our voices even and resisted sarcastic responses to Kamala? He was long-winded and stone-faced but he provided substance to his answers or as much as one can with 2 uninterrupted minutes. We all know he is the good cop of this administration and even if he didnt answer all questions he was respectful to his opponent.  Finally we learned that even when (after months of hoping from the left) Trump contracts COVID-19 takes the experimental treatments and not only survives but maintains a relatively regular schedule it is still not enough. It is not enough to quell the irrational fears. It is not enough calm the sensationalized media. It is not enough.  The left has so much faith in their candidate they have already started a process to replace him once in office. Making faux good-faith attempts at passing a stimulus after months of silence. Compromising the integrity of the election with mail in ballots likes its open season. They have so much faith in the polls they are still creating distractions 3 weeks before the election.  This election is not just about character and charisma it is about the seed of our nation. Freedom. The Governor of California introduced guidelines for holiday get togethers at home. Why should he have any say in how we celebrate holidays in our homes? That is what socialism is. That is not what America is. Think about that at the polls.  #thefactualfeline #COVID19 #Biden2020 #Trump2020 #VPDebate #GodBlessAmerica #election2020 #VoteRedLikeaBoss,political,Facebook
"In the politics of the United States Republican In Name Only is a pejorative term applied to officials elected as members of the Republican Party but govern and legislate like Democrats. Similar terms have been used since the early 1900s. The term is an acronym invented in order so that it is abbreviated to RINO and pronounced to sound like ""rhino"".[1] The term became popular in the 1990s.  ****** Attention to those who think or hear that Philip Rizzo is a RINO. Please don't fall for these soundbite words. The RINOS are the ESTABLISHMENT POLITICIANS like Jack who was placed neatly into the GOP pic ( and broke rules to do it ) The RINOS are people like Hirsh who cannot even get out of his childhood home or get a job outside of his parents home who is FUNDED by his father to run as a republican yet donates to MURPHY and his campaign. If you all are real TRUMP supporters think about it.

"What a sham what a charade today ! ""The January 6 hearings"" They are so afraid of Trump even now that he is out of office that they had a completely scripted soap opera in the house with police and other ""witnesses"". They do all this out of fear he may run and win again ! They say that January 6th. was so so so terrible. There can never be a day worse than that ! Not a full year of rioting & looting & burning & destroying private & public properties destroying businesses killing innocent people and police. A full year of anarchy with tacit silence & in some cases democrat encouragement was not as bad. It was ""mostly peaceful"" & ""the summer of love"". Today Capitol police castigated Trump for saying his followers were a loving crowd. The presentations or ""testimony"" was so scripted & phony with some congressmen even crying. The fake and self righteous indignation and feigned pain was so obvious and manipulated. They all had to relive the awful memory of the ""violent Trump mobs"". Liz Cheney said "" you held the line. You defended all of us. You defended the Capitol & you defended The Constitution & the republic.Every American owes you our undying gratitude.""

AFGHANISTAN WHAT EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD KNOW  Today was a tough day. A sad day. A day that should have and could have been prevented. Today was the greatest single loss of life our American military has suffered in ten years. In fact this whole fiasco or my better stated this catastrophe could have been prevented. To provide you a better understanding of the current situation and how/why we are where we are please allow me to provide some background and much needed truth and even better truth in context.  Over the last few days I have directly and personally spoken with and heard from former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo former DNI John Ratcliffe and the current Secretaries of Defense State Homeland Security Director of National Intelligence and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. The following is the best and most honest account and assessment I can provide to my constituents and the American People without divulging any specific classified information.  PRESIDENT TRUMPS PLAN FOR WITHDRAWAL  On Feb 29 2020 Pres Trump announced he had reached an agreement to withdraw American forces from Afghanistan by May 2021. This deal was a conditions based withdrawal and if certain conditions werent being met the US reserved the right to delay or tear up the deal. These conditions?  The Taliban would agree to  cut all ties with Al-Queda enter into a peaceful power sharing agreement with the Afghani Govt led by Pres Ghani Honor all checkpoints manned by Afghan troops Not to attack or destabilize provincial capitals protect the rights of women & minorities not attack US Troops  Now as you may have guessed the Taliban didnt always live up to their side of the bargain. They probed. They violated. On numerous occasions. And somewhat of a cycle would play out.  1. Taliban violates agreement 2. US hits back hard with Afghan ground forces with strong US air cover. 3. Taliban retreats 4. Americans reach out via back channels 5. Taliban properly disciplined agrees not to repeat  And these (mostly) minor violations would continue with the same result. You see they were probing and testing our resolve. They wanted to see what they could get away with. If they were met with strength? Theyd back off. But If they were met with weakness then you can guess how they would have responded. Well you dont have to guess because in 2021 they met with mush and as we witnessed they grew increasingly emboldened and aggressive.  At this point we need to be fair and absolutely clear. Had President Trump served another term none of us know exactly how this withdrawal would have played out. We dont. And we never will. For sure anyway. But there are some pretty strong clues that point to a very different outcome.  First Pres Trump listened intently to his advisors on this issue and adjusted his own perception and plans accordingly. He was deeply committed to getting all Americans out and if necessary our proven Afghan allies. He was also just as committed to ensuring that the Taliban if they came to power would get nothing nada zilch not one piece of American equipment. I was told repeatedly by folks that were in the room with the President that he wanted and I quote Not even a styrofoam cooler with an American flag on it left behind. He also said more than once Not a single bullet not one. Not a single American bullet is gonna be left.  So how did we get from that to where we are today?  Many in the Biden Administration and some of their media allies are trying to push out the myth that the unraveling of the Afghan Govt and military caught even the intelligence community by surprise. This is an utter and provable lie. When Pres Trump would meet with his intel team he would ask every time if conditions are not met and honored how long do you all think the Afghanis will last? EVERY voice shared the same assessment. Most likely a few weeks. At best a month or two. The President himself often would share that he didnt think theyd last two days. Without agreed upon conditions being a reality a clear disaster awaited.  And theres some strong evidence that points to the fact that this would almost assuredly played out differently under a Trump Administration. From the day the agreement was reached over the next year and a half not one American was lost to anger in Afghanistan. We drew down from 15000 to 2500 troops and there was enviable stability. Today we have twice as many boots on the ground and we have chaos.  For years in Afghanistan we would root out and kill bad guys and now we are begging for mercy from some of these very same thugs. Now the Taliban have more Blackhawk helicopters than the nation of Australia. Toss a $50 M67 grenade into a $20 million Blackhawk and viola no more high tech weaponry in the hands of the Taliban or Iran or China. The obvious best case scenario for the $85 billion worth of equipment left behind would have been for us to take the valuable stuff out with us. But failing that its inexcusable and quite frankly unforgivable that it wasnt destroyed before falling into enemy hands. There are reports that Blackhawks and other highly sensitive and advanced weaponry is already being couriered to Iran and China. And if true which it almost certainly is wed have to expect that China is going to do everything within their power to reverse engineer our cutting edge technology.  Please allow me to be crystal clear. What we have witnessed in the last two months is not a failure of intelligence in any way it is a failure to accept/acknowledge the intelligence and take appropriate action. The Afghanistan catastrophe and the subsequent loss of life equipment and prestige is a failure of leadership.  Joe Biden moved the original May 1st deadline to August 31st. While I agreed then and still do now that the original deadline needed to be moved Aug 31st was not the right time. It was obvious by the Spring the Taliban were acting in bad faith. Other than laying off our troops they werent honoring the terms of the agreement. They were making moves to simply wait us out and then strike against the Afghan government the moment we left. Under just such a scenario we were really left with two choices. Ramp back up and stay put or leave but leave at the beginning of winter evac all but a skeleton crew of American civilians AND have executable plans in place to withdraw any and all Americans that remained and proven Afghan allies and then destroy all sensitive equipment that couldnt be removed. Unfortunately and tragically no such plans were ever drawn up and the deadline wasnt moved.  In Afghanistan fighting is seasonal. Always has been. The climate is unmerciful and the Afghan winter doesnt lend itself to being all that conducive to combat operations. The fighting season begins in the spring and ends in the late fall. In the winter months over the past several decades many Taliban fighters would head over to Pakistan to rest and recoup. If Biden knew the Feb 2020 agreed upon conditions werent being honored (they werent) and if he was still hellbent on leaving (he was) the very least he should have done was set a Dec departure. This way the fledging Ghani Govt and military could have had 4-5 months to get their footing and build confidence in themselves and one another. This would simply have given them the best chance for success. Again no guarantees they would have survived but not giving them this opportunity was criminally negligent.  So where are we now and where do we go from here?  On July 8th Joe Biden said in no uncertain terms he didnt trust the Taliban. I believe If Im not mistaken he reiterated that same sentiment again today. So that begs the question. If thats true Sir why are you reportedly sharing sensitive contact information and the whereabouts of American citizens with THE TALIBAN? If this is proven to be true Id say it rises to the level of an impeachable offense. Further Mr Biden said today that he would retaliate against those who murdered our Marines. How exactly is that going to be accomplished when hes still ordering our military to runaway and leave by this arbitrary Aug 31st deadline?! Our departure would render the closest base from which to launch a strike about 8 flying hours away!  The Aug 31st deadline is arbitrary. Please make no mistake about that. And now Biden has allowed it to become a Taliban red line?! Since when were these thugs allowed to decide American foreign policy?! Sticking to the 31st is akin to an unconditional surrender. We have 13 new gold star families in the homeland somewhere between 1000-4000 Americans still in theater and thousands more proven Afghan allies in harms way $85 billion in equipment left behind and Biden and his double down woke crew is still insisting on leaving in a few days.  Every military and intelligence advisor and expert agrees we CANNOT evacuate all of the Americans that want to leave by Aug 31st. Same with our allies. Cant do it.  A QUICK SIDE BAR ON BAGRAM AIR BASE  25 miles north of Kabul Airport where are troops are now and where the suicide attack today took place is Bagram Air Base. It was the largest base the US operated in Afghanistan. And we gave it up. Why? Because Joe Biden wouldnt allow for enough US forces present to keep it. So on July 1st 2021 without telling our Afghan allies the last remaining American forces slipped away under cover of night. 7 weeks later the Bagram fell to the Taliban.  History is watching. 20 years of trust has evaporated in 2 months. There are geopolitical implications as well and they reach far beyond Afghanistan. This debacle and Joe Bidens lack of leadership is playing directly into the narrative of the Chinese Communists in Beijing and in Putins Kremlin. They assert that America is a nation in decline and our power is waning. They tell anyone who will listen that the Americans show only weakness to their enemies and are treacherous to their friends. The last two months certainly hasnt assuaged our allies fears in this regard. What do you think our friends in Eastern Europe are thinking right now? Do you think many are sleeping easy tonight in Kiev? Or Lithuania? Or Poland? How about Kuwait? Would we have their backs now?! And there are most definitely millions on the island nation of Taiwan tossing and turning this very night.  Joe Biden proclaimed last month that this wouldnt be another Saigon. Well he was right. Its worse. 13 Americans are dead more wounded scores of the innocent slaughtered and chaos reigns. What should we do to gain some semblance of order sanity honor and standing?  Push the timeline back and declare we will leave when our mission is complete. That mission will be complete after we  1. Take back Bagram 2. Fly in Armor and a sufficient force to hold Bagram evacuate ALL remaining Americans & proven allies 3. Expand and then secure permitted around Kabul Airport 3. Smash ISIS-K and kill every last son of a bitch who planned/ordered/carried out murderous attack on our brave Marines 4. Retrieve sensitive equipment & weaponry and destroy any that cant be securely evacd out 5. If the Taliban resistance persists take back Kabul (by most accounts there are only 6000 Taliban holding the city) and expose them for the bullying thugs that they are.  Once our mission has been accomplished then and only then leave.  I call Nancy Pelosi to immediately bring the House back into session. We are a co-equal branch of government and we must demand answers from this administration. All members of Congress should be briefed on the current situation and all questions from members should be answered in a secure classified setting if necessary in full. Committees of jurisdiction namely Armed Services (of which Im a member) Intel Foreign Affairs and Homeland Security should immediately begin oversight hearings. We must get top Administration officials in front of Congress and hear their sworn testimony. We have to get answers so we can ensure that this never happens again. Ever.  Please join me in keeping our brave warriors in your thoughts hearts and prayers. They gave everything and we owe it to them to give our all to complete the mission. Rest In Peace Heroes.

Its been a hard week seeing what's happening in Afghanistan.  Like many of you all I watched videos from the Kabul airport and saw pictures of military planes full of people fleeing. Gut wrenching stuff.  I served in Afghanistan from 2005 to 2006.  At that point Al Qaeda in Afghanistan had been decimated and we were thoroughly into the nation-building part of the war.  I was stationed in a remote desert outpost north of Kandahar with a couple dozen soldiers. Poppies grew against the barricades of our little fort.  We had a company of Afghan soldiers that lived just outside our razor-wire fence in their own area. Part of our job involved training and running missions with them.  Wed do that a few times a week. Wed get into our Humvees with our weapons and head out to a very small village a few hours away.  Most of the missions were humanitarian. Coordinating construction for wells and schools (which we paid for). Veterinarian missions to de-worm goats and sheep. Handing out solar-powered radios (hugely popular went fast).  Our little group of American soldiers tried hard to build goodwill everywhere we went. We were always handing stuff out having tea with the local elders kicking soccer balls around with the kids.  We were attacked by the Taliban several times. Usually with rockets sometimes with small-arms fire. I remember once at night being outside and suddenly seeing small bright lights fly overhead and being confused for a second. Then the rockets started to land and I realized those small lights had been tracer rounds.  But IEDs were the biggest threat. We were constantly on the lookout for freshly turned dirt near the road and drove off-road as much as possible. I was usually the driver on our missions and I still remember what it felt like to drive across a narrow bridge or some other chokepoint where you knew an IED would be unavoidable if it detonated. We all just held our breath and I drove as fast as possible.  Soldiers were hurt and killed including a close friend of mine the week we were set to leave.  And then I boarded a helicopter and went home.  After I left I was never able to get a good sense of how things were actually going. We heard the same cautious optimism from our leaders for years but it was hard to read much into that. There was visible progress and visible failure. President George Bush used to talk about an Afghanistan that could govern and defend itself. How close were we? How many more years would it take?  And now we know. Despite a massive effort we never even came close.  Trumps deal with the Taliban in 2018 created certainty that we would in fact be leaving. As a result the Taliban largely stopped attacking our troops. They were waiting.  We proceeded with our exit because we had already given Afghanistan everything we could. We poured $90 billion into the Afghan military and stayed for an entire generation - at a loss of nearly 2500 American servicemembers.  The Afghan army numbered close to 300000 at least on paper. They had certainly shown a willingness to fight having already lost 66000 soldiers in the last 20 years.  Afghanistan has 34 provinces. On August 6th the Taliban captured their first provincial capital. This wasnt a huge shock because the province was nestled between Iran and Pakistan farther from the national capital of Kabul than any other province. It was the lowest-hanging piece of fruit for the Taliban. That said it was taken with virtually no resistance which in retrospect was a sign of things to come.  In the next two days the Taliban captured four more provincial capitals.  In the next five days another 10 provincial capitals fell.  In the next three days it was over. The national capital of Kabul fell the president fled.  Thats nine days from the first province to the rest.  While a sizable number of elite Afghan soldiers put up a fight - and may now be regrouping in the Panjshir Valley north of Kabul - what we saw from the army regulars was near-instant capitulation. The bulk of the Afghan army wasnt defeated - it evaporated.  Its hard to put ourselves in the shoes of those Afghan soldiers and to understand their calculations - but it isnt hard to see what their ultimate decision was and that was essentially to walk off the battlefield en masse.  Now the mission is evacuation. Americans still in Afghanistan interpreters and their families and others who are at extreme risk - like 250 female judges who were still serving until this week - must be flown out of the country immediately.  Here are three major mistakes that have hindered the evacuation mission:  The first was the previous administrations decision to sharply reduce the processing of Special Immigrant Visas. Thats a program that was created specifically for Afghans and Iraqis who helped us and its supposed to be an expedited process to get them safely out of the country. It involves an administrative review that is arduous and bureaucratic even when its functioning - but Trump blocked almost all requests.  When Biden took over the wait-list had 17000 Afghans on it. That wasnt an oversight that was Trump lumping these people in with his broader anti-immigration message and not caring about the consequences. (Incidentally after seeing recent events he put out a statement saying that Afghans who assisted the U.S. should be allowed to seek refuge.)  That said fixing the SIV process should have been a much higher priority for the current administration. That was our second mistake. Yes the evaporation of the Afghan army was a shock. But we plan for unlikely contingencies all the time. That should have been one. There was no reason not to expedite the process by bringing the applicants to a U.S. territory like Guam and allowing the rest of the application process to occur there. Thats exactly what we did in 1975 when we left Vietnam. The governor of Guam even indicated that the island was prepared to accept them.  That should have happened back in April but it absolutely should have happened once we saw the Taliban making swift gains across the country in early July. Weve hit the gas on the process now and were evacuating several thousand people per day. Thats progress but it shows we could have sped things up much sooner.  Third we should not have given away the Bagram airfield before the evacuation mission was complete. If we were going to need to conduct a rapid large-scale evacuation we were going to need Bagram which was our largest base and the most fortified airfield. We left it in early July and now we have to rely on the airport in Kabul to conduct evacuation operations. Its much harder to defend and more limited in terms of air traffic given that it only has one runway while the airfield at Bagram has two.  Now we have no choice but to conduct our evacuation mission under extreme pressure. Thats a bad situation to be in and a tough mission but its a mission that we have an obligation to carry out. We dont get to call it a day and walk away from these people who helped us many of whom will surely die if we dont make the decision to save them.  We owe them as a nation - but I owe them personally. Every time we ran a mission I was putting my life in the hands of my interpreter. Our interpreter was at greater risk than any of us because the Taliban knew that if you take out the interpreter it makes the whole unit ineffective.  And he never ever let me down. Every mission every moment he was always by my side. I moved he moved. When we were in a village and a group of men suddenly started walking towards our team he would step forward and start speaking as quickly and calmly as he could. And this is the guy were going to cut loose? Unacceptable.  The same goes for that interpreters family. My interpreters wife and children became targets as soon as he ran his first mission with us. They took that risk together as a family so our obligation extends to them as a family.  Getting those folks out is the right thing to do but its also in our national interest. If we dont get them out whats going to happen the next time we need to ask locals in a foreign country to help us? How are those locals going to look at our soldiers when we ask them to trust us?  And to the 16 House Republicans who voted against the bill to speed up the visa applications there is no possible defense for that. To do that deliberately - knowing what it could lead to for those who helped us - is unconscionable.  We're already hearing some generic anti-refugee sentiment from some of these folks. I'd remind them of our history with respect to Vietnam.  After we left Vietnam we had a policy geared specifically to Vietnamese refugees. We helped people who otherwise would have been killed.  We don't regret that decision - we're proud of it.  One of those people who we saved became my next-door neighbor when I was a kid. He was a former officer for the South Vietnamese Army - who probably would have been killed if he hadnt gotten out - and by some amazing act of grace he and his wife landed in Chapel Hill North Carolina.  His son became one of my best friends. We grew up together. I never fully appreciated his familys story until I was in college. He had the opportunity to live a wonderful life because our country decided to keep its commitments to those who had fought with us.  As it turns out we couldnt bring democracy to Afghanistan - but we can decide to keep our commitments to those who fought for it with us.  That is now the mission and we must not fail.  - Jeff Jackson,political,Facebook

"U.S. AND RUSSIA  Rising tension between the U.S and Russia should be a cause for concern among all Americans. Although recently the tensions between the nuclear armed powers have slightly eased due to the Russian pullback of troops along the Ukrainian border the general trajectory of the relationship points toward eventual conflict. Only ""the people"" can restrain the movement towards war. To enable this restraint it is perhaps helpful to view U.S.-Russia relations from the Russian perspective. Let me qualify the following by stating that I am not an expert on U.S.-Russia relations; but from a layperson's perspective this is what I see.  Russia has been pushed around by the West since its dissolution in December of 1991. At that time it's state dominated command economy was collapsing and there began a movement towards a free market capitalist system first gradually during the late 1980's under the Soviet leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev then very rapidly under Russia's first democratically elected President Boris Yeltsin.  During the economic collapse of the early 1990's western nation's offered aid to Russia largely through the G7--a group of advanced industrialized nations--and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) contingent on the dismantling of the Russian state dominated economic system. The transformation from the old to the new system within Russia was highly controversial with President Boris Yeltsin pushing for reform while Russia's parliamentary body consisting largely of communist and ultranationalist resisted the rapid transformation. This deeply divided the Nation.  It would be hard to overestimate the hardship this transformation imposed on the Russian people. Widespread homelessness child and adult prostitution increased rates of alcoholism decreased life expectancy all accompanied the transformation to the western style economic model. From 1991-1998 during the western aided transformation Russia's GDP fell nearly 40%. During the 1996 presidential election the G7 and the IMF pumped billions of dollars into the Russian economy in order to salvage a Yeltsin victory from a stiff challenge by a communist opponent: election interference by any measure.  The transformation left deep scars on the Russian people and depending on one's view of the transformation generated resentment against the West. Many among the older generation the intelligentsia and workers longed for a return to Soviet times. Conspiracy theories abound which suggest the West deliberately undermined the Russian state. One argument states that current President Putin's hybrid authoritarian democratic political model where the U.S. currently seems to be headed was an effort to establish order out of the chaos of the 1990's. The U.S. condemns Putin's trend towards authoritarianism but little such condemnation existed in 1993 when U.S. President Clinton supported the free market oriented Yeltsin's unconstitutional dissolution of the Russian parliament which had resisted the transformation to the capitalist model. It is of course possible that Russia would have suffered equal economic hardship had Russia persisted on its state dominated path but this matters little as people were suffering and the suffering was due to the then current transformation process.  During West-East negotiations over the reunification of Germany during 1990 Russian concerns about NATO expansion eastward towards the Russian border were allayed when U.S. Secretary of State James Baker assured the Russians that NATO would not expand ""one inch eastward"" towards the Russian border. By the end of the 1990's decade NATO expanded: eastward to include three former Soviet Republics; since then it has expanded eastward to include eleven more states most former Soviet Republics three of which: Estonia Latvia and Lithuania lie directly on a Russian border. NATO has a working relationship with both Georgia and Ukraine both former Soviet Republics which also lie on the Russian border and both of which are working towards NATO membership. Russians find NATO expansion to its borders as threatening and in breach of Western promises to not expand ""one inch eastward"" towards the Russian border.  Russia's 2014 forceful annexation of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula transferred to Ukraine by Russia during 1954 under former Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev can be seen as an effort to protect both the Russian border as well as the Russian Black Sea fleet partially housed on the Crimean peninsula. Further both Ukraine and Georgia have experienced western friendly coups both with some level of U.S. support.  Most recently in response to continued tensions between Ukraine and Russia the U.S. had threatened to float two naval warships into the Black Sea which would be the equivalent of Russian warships sailing into the Gulf of Mexico. How do you think that might work out?  The former great power undoubtedly feels threatened and humiliated by the above turn of events. Russia views itself as a world power which has been undermined by the neoliberal economic order. Russian bashing among U.S. politicians generally works well across the full political spectrum although somewhat less so among conservatives since Trump; and the U.S. libertarian movement generally opposes international entanglement and war.  There is no effort here to suggest Russia is holier than its western counterparts. Hierarchy is hierarchy and it knows no other way than domination and submission. If the tables were turned perhaps the Russians would act in the same manner. This assuredly is the view of the hierarchical actors who play this nonsensical game. Just as assuredly however there are people in Russia as in the U.S. who desire peace. It is hard for the peacemakers to rise to power when there is so much turmoil in the world. To even speak of peace is often viewed as naive. If in the U.S a significant peace movement were to evolve this would allow room for the Russians to do the same. If not we are doomed to ""solutions"" by war. There seems to be no shortage of those who belong to the war movement.  To protest the U.S. movement towards war is not an unpatriotic act. It is perhaps the highest act of patriotism. Young people who often join the military in an effort to fulfill a deep sense of idealism should not be subject to the loss of life and limb in order to fulfill the political and ideological ambitions of a cynical ruling elite. To love one's nation is to embrace the potential of its youth not to sacrifice its youth to the gods of material and political ambitions. It is time for the insanity to end.",political,Facebook
Cults among us checklist!  1. They micromanage your life. You are not allowed to make decisions without their approval. 2. Their word trumps your personal relationship with God and your ability to hear Him for yourself. 3. They make it seem like they are the only ones with a certain revelation or movement of God. 4. They decreasingly minister elsewhere and invest most of their energy in building their own platform. This is because... 5. They say everyone wont receive them. In actuality everyone will not receive their lack of character/fruit of the Spirit. 6. They demand you sacrifice for them. Money time excessive services/events/lives. You dont give as you feel led you give as they demand. 7. They publicly humiliate you. Anyone who makes a mistake or does anything that doesnt jive with how they do things is fair game. 8. They encourage people to spy and tattle/report on the words and actions of other members. This includes monitoring people whove left the ministry. 9. Its more like a police state or plantation than a ministry. 10. There is an unhealthy and excessive emphasis on honour. The problem is the way they understand honour is actually a form of idolatry. 11. There is an unhealthy and excessive emphasis on submission. And the submission is to them not to God. (See #1 and #2.) 12. Any one who disagrees with them or has a difference of opinion is wrong immature disrespectful unsubmissive rebellious etc. 13. Anyone who calls out an offense or unjust act by the leadership is identified as having a spirit of offense and is spiritually immature. This is because... 14. The founders of the ministry can do no wrong. Their voice is in place of God; they speak for God and if you dont agree then youre not operating in the Spirit of God. 15. Their rules trump the rules of your household. You are supposed to obey and submit to them OVER your spouse as well as any other mentors leaders peers and parents you may have. 16. Any peer or elder who has something to say against them is identified as being jealous or envious of what they believe they have. 17. Any person of lesser rank who has something to say against them is identified as being rebellious rogue or jezebelic. They are also not considered worth listening to because their rank is lesser than the leaders. 18. Only God can check them. This is difficult because it would seem that the god in their head agrees with and approves of everything they say/do. (See #14.) 19. They treat people like trash and call it the anointing. They are controlling/domineering and petty and call it apostolic order. They are mean nasty and manipulative and call it prophetic. 20. They are nice to and spend time with people who can further their platform/agenda give them large amounts of money or make them look good. Not average people or supporters. 21. They have a revolving door of peers associates and subordinates. They are not authentically kind or generous so they can not maintain authentic relationships. (See #4 and #5.) 22. There is supernatural demonstration but little-to-no fruit of the Spirit. 23. They have a ride-or-die loyal following. Even if the people question the leadership they dont dare voice it because... 24. The people are controlled by a spirit of fear. Because the fear of the Lord is equated to the fear of man (the ministry leadership) people are afraid to speak out or leave because they think their calling will be deterred. They think their calling purpose promotion prosperity and miracles are tied to that ministry. Theyve also seen and or participated in the public humiliation of anyone who has spoken up and dont want it to happen to them as well. 25. Anyone who leaves the ministry or speaks against them/their actions has their character assassinated. This is classic jezebelic form: destroying a persons character in order to discredit their voice or ministry. 26. The ministry will release word curses and evil judgments against those who leave their ministry. This is will be particularly prominent if the ministry is in any way threatened by person who left. This is a form of spiritual witchcraft. 27. Anyone who leaves the ministry will be iced out by the ministry and most of their followers. 28. People who leave the ministry have to detox and go through deliverance to break the unhealthy soul ties that were formed and the abuse that was experienced. 29. People who leave the ministry have to tip toe and walk on egg shells around people in the ministry and people who left because they dont know if its safe to talk to them. 30. They control what you can and cannot post as well as what you can and cannot like on social media. 31. They control any spiritual/ministerial influences you listen to. If its not approved by the ministry then according to them you shouldnt listen to it. They want to be the dominant influence in your life above all else - even God. 32. Prophetic words will be given - and withheld - in order to control the people and keep them tied to the ministry. 33. Scripture is perverted to communicate the opinions and agendas of the leadership. A legitimate doctrine of devils may even be taught. This is the last item on the list because it is often the last to show up. Error always appears last in the pulpit.  Do you see these things in your church? If youre defending them youre defending a cult not God. If you have experienced these things you can be free and be delivered!

When I decided to run for office I knew that I would be exposing my positions to challenges and ridicule but I have been amazed at the level of non-productive diatribe I have seen. I have been successful in finding attackers from both the left and right that have called me a liberal trump lover fence walker and senile conservative boomer all in the same week and its only Thursday. Who actually thinks these characterizations are productive? How can any of us who are unable to get someone else to empathize with us and see the prospective of a situation from our vantage point believe that this means the other person has a low IQ or is an idiot? Would it not be fair to assume part of the problem may be our inability to understand how they learn so we can get our point across? Wouldnt that mean we may be the one with the insufficient IQ? Why has it become so important to assign titles and characterizations to others of differing opinions rather than work to find sufficient middle ground to achieve a solution that is acceptable to all parties? I signed up for this target so its part of the entry fee. But I cant help but wonder what we could accomplish if we put as much energy into trying to understand each other as we do attacking each other.,political,Facebook
If Title-42 restrictions are lifted DHS is preparing for 350000-400000 potential illegal migrant crossings in a SINGLE month. This is nearly as many crossings as we saw in 2020 over the entire YEAR.

"A Reminder for True Republicans:  Remember when Obama was President? He was a tall slim good-looking guy -- full of charm and with a killer smile. Democrats loved him and his liberal agenda. That was Obama but it sounds a lot like Luke Rankin doesn't it?  Then along came Trump with a whole different package -- not a politician totally untested politically with some allegations of questionable behavior. But he claimed to be a conservative Republican who pledged to do what Republicans wanted: hold down taxes protect the unborn defend 2nd Amendment rights.  Many voted for the conservative Republican over the liberal Democrat with lots of doubts some trepidation and their fingers crossed. But look what this unlikely President has done in advancing conservative Republican causes! Trump kept his campaign promises!  The same opportunity exists with John Gallman. The potential is there. You as a Republican have the opportunity to cross your fingers hope for the best and elect an untested but true conservative Republican rather than a Democrat hiding behind a Republican title -- a financial advisor rather than a lawyer.  Choose wisely Republican faithful. Don't be swayed by looks and charm or by ugly campaign allegations. As Nikki Haley once said: "" Luke Rankin votes with the Democrats. Every. Single. Time.""

"Thank you Lucy for your Letter to the Editor and calling this out.  THE CHOICE IS OURS To the Editor: I am guessing that we are all sick and tired of politics at their worst and are looking forward to being on the other side of Nov. 3. This election cycle has brought out the best and the worst in politics but the worst has dropped to lows that we couldn't have imagined and hopefully will not be exposed to again in our lifetimes. And that is where we have the power. On a national regional and local level the stooping has been consistent exhausting and impossible to avoid. Unfounded claims have been made about candidates in all three races in New Hampshire. This is typical of the tactics that the Trump campaign uses. If you label the other side whether honestly or not eventually with enough repetition the label sticks an association is made. It's bad enough that we must endure this on national and state levels but it feels like a toxic invasion when it happens on our home front. There have now been three different tactics used (that I am aware of) to bash Sue Ford who is running as the Democratic candidate for to be the State Senator for District 1 in New Hampshire our district. The first occurred before the primaries when I received a ""polling"" call. I was assured that it was a neutral poll when I asked and when it clearly favored Democratic positions I stopped it and was told to see it out. It then did a complete turn-around and bashed Sue Ford while praising Erin Hennessey. This technique is referred to as pacing and leading and is sheer manipulation. I was so surprised that the NH Republican Party would invest in this tactic on a local race. The second sleazy ploy in this race was to mail out a flyer to voters in the district that slammed Sue Ford. Just imagine how many people received this and took it as the truth. And just imagine how much money the NH Republican Party spent on pure negative politics during this time of crisis and stress. And the third attack angle is currently happening on social media. An ad on the New Hampshire Senate Republicans Facebook page attacks Sue Ford and if explored one can see that it is ""Paid for by NH Senate Republicans PAC Chuck Morse Chairman"". Morse is the current NH Senate Minority leader. The ad features a website that is anti-Sue Ford and attacks her for voting for the Family Medical Leave Act a protection that seems especially timely during these pandemic times. It also attacks her for standing against School Choice which is being promoted by Frank Edelblut NH's version of Betsy DeVos a move that would drain funds from NH public schools and possibly put our tax dollars into supporting religious schools. It's difficult to imagine that Erin Hennessey is unaware of the tone of her campaign and has no say in its direction. ""I approve this message"" used to follow campaign ads and if candidates don't approve the message and the means then are we voting for a candidate or the powers that control them? Sue Ford's campaign by comparison has been clean thankfully. She runs on her record of having been an elected Representative to Concord for the North Country and it's quite a commendable record. She worked hard in that role and voted in ways that supported the people of the North Country. It is telling that the New Hampshire Republican Party is targeting her so lavishly. They are clearly threatened by her candidacy in this race. The unfortunate component however is that instead of promoting Erin Hennessey they are attacking Sue Ford. Isn't this exactly the sort of campaign that is exhausting and demoralizing us? And can't they think of anything positive to say about Erin? Voting is the most important way that we can express ourselves in a democracy. It is the pivot point of the system. We vote for the candidate who we believe will do the best job. In voting we are not only supporting the candidate but also the means in which they are presented in their campaign and the tone of the campaign itself. A vote for a candidate is also a vote reinforcing the strategy and tone used. The question here is whether we want to validate and reward dirty politics and thus perpetuate them or whether we want to invest in a candidate who has proven herself to be worthy of our votes and has not stooped to new and demoralizing lows. It would seem like enough is enough when it comes to toxicity of attack politics and if we are ever going to move on we must invest our votes in a direction that promises growth and a return to civility. A vote for Sue Ford is a vote for just this and will also send the message to the Republican Party and its local candidate Erin Hennessey that we do not support dirty politics and that it is time to move on. In doing this we will have hit our low as a country and a region and can rediscover mutual respect and cooperation. Thank you Lucy Golden - Franconia",political,Facebook
"Children in detention camps in cages without beds clean clothes medicine or much food. Separated from their parents some as young as 2 years old. Over 5.000 children have been separated from their parents in some cases for over a year and this is still happening.

And Donald Trump has stated that the only reason for the separation is as a ""deterrent"" to make other people think twice before fleeing violence and chaos. Totally heartless.

A BLOW FOR IMMIGRATION AND GOVERNMENTAL REFORM  A federal District Court in Houston has struck down the Obama Administrations Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and its companion for parents of those children. Specifically it held that the program was an administrative rule making required to follow the notice and comment process of the federal Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The failure of the Obama Administration to follow this process rendered the program illegal. CNN helpfully included a copy of the Order and Opinion of the court here. The decision is not only a step towards effective immigration reform but also strikes a blow against the power of the administrative state.  The court essentially took up the issues ignored in the US Supreme Courts Regents of the University of California opinion previously discussed here. This decision struck down the attempted rescission of the DACA program by the Trump Administration as itself violating the APA while glossing over the illegalities in the original rulemaking. This new federal court opinion turns the tables and focuses on those infirmities noting that the Supreme Court itself held that DACA was not simply a passive non- enforcement policy. Instead it conferred affirmative immigration relief such as the right to receive a work permit and the right to travel abroad without permission. It did so despite admitting in the original memorandum that only the Congress could confer affirmative immigration relief. The district courts opinion built on Justice Clarence Thomass dissent in the Regents opinion by highlighting the real reason for the program  the inability of successive Presidents to unite the Congress and country around an immigration bill that included effective limits and enforcement as well as the necessary relief for longtime residents.  The district court was mindful of the hardships an immediate cessation of the program would cause to current participants and simply prohibited further expansion of the program for the time being. The Biden Administration has announced that it will appeal the order and urged Congress to pass a bill fixing the problem. The administrations latter position is correct. Both political parties need to look beyond the twin corruptions of identity politics and corporate contributions to pass a comprehensive immigration reform legalizing the status of the Dreamers and creating real enforceable limits on future immigration as I advocated in this post. A truly comprehensive answer to the immigration crisis would be a new beginning for insuring the American Dream for both lifetime citizens and immigrants alike.

Meet You in the Middle  Healing divisions while facing enemies at home and abroad  By Shay McNeal  This morning definitely feels different. From the moment I saw the video of Mr. Floyd pleading for his life and the officer (whose name I do not even want to type) willfully ignoring his and others call to recognize that he had a human beneath his knee who was in grave jeopardy I knew just people would not tolerate this action. As Floyds ability to bring precious life forth from his body was ebbing he called for his mother and he was ignored. What kind of animal keeps his hand in his pocket and passively rejects the cries from a man he purportedly had worked with when both men had been hired to provide security at a local nightclub in Minnesota?  One can only question had their paths crossed in some testosterone-charged manner while policing the nightlife in clubs where they were expected to be manly as they were there to remind folks Ill boot you out if you dont behave. I can only in desperation wonder if there is a back story that somehow would even begin to explain how dismissive and unconnected this officer appears as Mr. Floyd gasps for air and pleads for his mother. Did this go tragically wrong as the officer thought it was not really serious? I am just searching for any I repeat any feasible explanation that one human can do to another what happened to Mr. Floyd. How did such nonchalant disregard well up in one man against another? Is race the answer in this case? Was it causative? If not the outcome has spawned and wholly ignited a race-driven atmosphere that has far reaching consequences both here and abroad.  For the sake of all humanity we need to take a hard look at what is lying just under the skin regardless of what color ones skin is that allows these horrific events to unfold. We keep hearing how police are motivated by race when arresting African Americans. Indeed there are those who had a race-driven mentality baked into their souls. I have been privileged to work with law enforcement and know that the vast majority of police ranks would not even comprehend doing such a thing to a person just because they happened to be a person of color as what was perpetrated on Mr. Floyd. I also know these people  yes countless people who are protecting us are colorblind  regardless of their age or background. On the other hand the action against Mr. Floyd is seen too much. Are those who are driven by systemically racist feelings just waiting for an opportunity of a traffic stop a non-violent warrant or a warrant that is issued in a criminal case to find a reason to harm maim and sometimes kill the object of their hatred? George Floyd was accused of passing counterfeit money and apparently surrendered to the police. Why did this escalate?  Can we root out vile hateful people from our policing ranks so people of color in this country can breathe freely without fear that some sort of justice will be taken before they have a real day in court to determine if they have violated the laws of this nation? Moreover there are those who have been wrongly aggressed and have no reason to be stopped just because they are a person of color. Cant we find a way for a telephone call to be sent directly to an internal watchdog committee that steps in to stop the escalation immediately. Sure some would take advantage of that avenue but is it not worth it to stop escalations during these turbulent encounters? There must be a way for the laws and actions taken by officers to be applied equally? We cannot give up our civilization to these moments. If this is not the breaking point we may not be far from the breaking point that will destabilize our nation in the most profound way.  Lets look at the last few months. An attack was leveled squarely at this country and its name was Covid-19. One of the most aggressive enemies we have faced in the last 100 years. During the Spanish Flu epidemic that lasted for two years we also had race riots. Affecting the lives and economy of this country it also is taking a disproportionate amount of people of color. It is now in danger of surging again. The closeness of the crowds forming in many of our cities and not social distancing may lead to more deaths. How fair is that to all folks especially when the majority of the crowds are people of color?  Not much changes in history. If we do not fix or at least attempt to resolve the issues that have repeatedly led to unrest we are going to relive them. But this time it is distinctly different. In the past information did not run at the speed of light and foreign adversaries could not so handedly distribute their take. Now they are bent on distorting our challenge to their advantage. How many people of color reside in China or Russia? Look it up. You will be astounded as they tell us what to do.  Believe me: They do not have any moral superiority. Today the Chinese governments position was that Pelosi and Pompeo should now understand that we are as guilty as they are in their opposition to the demonstrators in Hong Kong. Pardon me and I may get some blow back from what I am about to say but I do not and will not buy this as being in any way the same kind of demonstrator. Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997 with signed agreements to last for 50 years that the citizens of Hong Kong were to retain self-governance they had enjoyed under British rule.  This past week after Covid-19 which started in China and quieted their demonstrations for several months the Chinese Communist Party is coming down hard. If you are outside of the party mandates you are dragged out of your home in the middle of the night and often your family is as well. Depending on who you are you may just disappear. I defy any American to prove that our government has taken this kind of action against our citizens black or white as a stated position of the American government. Please find for me one government mandated reeducation camp like millions of Uighurs have been pressed to inhabit. They are being forced to leave behind their homes their religions and their culture as they are being told they will remain in custody until they conform? Just because of the accident of birth they will never be able to live freely even after being reeducated.  Our race relations have a troubled history and must be addressed but not in a political fashion. The political divide is at a fever pitch and has been growing for decades. In September 2016 in my column which was titled Whos Dealing the Truth as Pols Play the race card I wrote: Race has been a difficult issue in this country. Honest dialogue has been nearly impossible to cultivate as there is a deep well of emotions that can spew its rancid water anytime the discussions become inflamed.  There is no doubt we should have engaged in more honest discussions long ago but I fear the struggle to have those discussions as we attempt to meet in the middle will now be influenced by bad players. Nation states that pay for and fuel agitators here are very sophisticated. Their purpose is to seize the issue that has divided us and divide us enough to destroy our nation as history has shown they have been successful at before now. China and Russia were reformulated in just this way. I know we are smarter than that  lets seize the moment and work hard with honesty and pure motivation fueled by respect for each other as we demonstrate how a true democracy works for all. Then those whose propaganda seeks to distort what moral superiority actually looks like will have been reeducated.,political,Facebook

A president that has evaded taxes payments paying only $750 for the last two years and not paying any for years while getting 80 Million refund from IRS and now that is in dispute due to his efforts to use loopholes and most likely fraudulent records. And still refuses to release his tax returns to show the truth if different. A president that has no empathy for social justice for War heroes and no solutions to the chaos and violence we are living in and promoter of hate division and White Supremacy.

I watched George Floyd die and was full of sorrow but not shock. Mostly because of that  the lack of shock - I knew I had to protest. My 70 year old husband was keen to go with me but we are also very mindful of COVID and crowds. Also in Arizona its over 100 degrees this time of year and I have had three bouts of heat stroke. The last time I protested Donald Trump visiting my state I was unfortunately but fortunately throwing up in a chain restaurant bathroom when the police tear-gassed the crowd. I wouldnt want to be a 61 year old female with high blood pressure hugging the throne when it might be a corona virus petri dish.  Our solution was to don masks brave a supply store make two signs and stand on a neighborhood street corner: Black Lives Matter! Justice4George! We were amazed when the reaction was 10-to-1 positive in our red white and wealthy town. We were also happy almost high with the feeling that contrary to our negative expectations most people anywhere with or without privilege are for life and justice. They are also not racist or at least dont want to be and desire equal rights under the law oppose police brutality and believe in free speech and all of the Constitution.  We went out again to our neighboring town. There were rumors of a big crowd that didnt come although two 20 somethings stopped and joined us. We made each others day bridging the generational divide as well as standing against the divide of race. The rumored rightwing militia that has formed in our community also did not show but we were watched by two carloads of men. Perhaps they wanted a fight but were disappointed in their chance to beat up two old peaceful white folks. I did have on a black mask but it was for COVID and not Antifa. But to out greater surprise favorable reaction was almost 20-to-1 others brought us water and thanked us and in spite of one cry that brought back my hippie days  get a job!  it was a rousing success. We went home with tired feet but hopeful hearts. Maybe all could be well in America.  Then I returned to the news and social media. There is the movement to defund the police to eliminate them. Isnt that anarchy? More and more call for social justice (does that mean radical redistribution of wealth?) instead of justice as in equal protection of the law. More and more call for forced equality of result and not equality of rights. Arent those things socialism?  I am a libertarian Republican and have been for decades. I have found the last four years hellish and I saw Trump as an authoritarian well before he used the military on peaceful US citizens. I do not call anyone who opposes him a socialist as his followers do. A liberal welfare state is tolerable as is a conservative corporate welfare position. I am used to being politically homeless not fitting in the far right or far left being the odd one out hanging with more leftwing friends because they are the majority in my animal rights and environmental causes.  I cannot support a movement that moves too far. I stopped engaging with the womens march movement a few years back when all their speakers and backers were too far left for me. I cut ties with libertarians when they supported Trump became right wing anarchists or Rand Paul became their unfortunate figurehead. This libertarian usually but gladly ends up with the moderates the derisively called wishy washy middle. God bless them for letting me in. Do I have to leave the BLM movement now? No more standing on the street corner showing others that a person can be old and white and privileged and still give a damn? Yes we need massive change: differently trained demilitarized police stripped of their immunities. But we need them. It hurts this liberty lover to say that; yet it hurts no more than having to defend the intelligence community and the military  both things I have done lately and they are not your usual libertarian allies. In the end I am a minarchist and not an anarchist not an anarchist of left or right. And it does no good to explain that most protesters are not violent Antifa anarchist when many of those peaceful people want me to exist in a power vacuum. In my community the rightwing boogaloo militias will fill it and neither the protesters nor I will like that reality.  Thankfully most Americans are not far left or far right. They are decent and want each individual to be treated decently. They want decent and non-brutal police. They want a Republic that protects justice and equal rights not an authoritarian state that unleashes bad cops or unmarked military on us all. But they also want some order protection of hard-earned property and to preserve the best system on earth. Our Constitutional Republic is imperfect hurting and frayed but it is still a work of brilliance that balances the authoritarian against the mob protects the rights of the individual from the majoritarian whim. Can we just make it better instead of throwing the proverbial baby out with the bath water? Is that too much to ask for? Madison Jefferson and Hamilton said no  what do we say?,political,Facebook

I think hes demonstrated that through his life.  Fiorina a former CEO of Hewlett-Packard who also ran unsuccessfully for the Senate in California in 2010 said last month that she wouldnt vote for the president this November.  Fiorina and Trump repeatedly clashed during the 2016 Republican presidential primaries with Trump criticizing Fiorinas physical appearance.  ""Look at that face! Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that the face of our next president"" Trump said in an interview with Rolling Stone in December 2015.  Two months after Fiorina ended her White House bid in February 2016 Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas announced that he would name her as his running mate if he won the GOP presidential nomination. But Cruz dropped out of the race a week later.  Even though she clashed with Trump in the 2016 primaries Fiorina ended up voting for her partys standard-bearer in the November general election.  Reacting to Fiorina's new comments Trump on Thursday tweeted that ""She lost so badly to me twice in one campaign that she should be voting for Joe. No complaints!!!""

Oh God the degree of incompetence of Joe Biden is mind boggling. He really thinks that there was no way to get out of Kabul without the chaos and the disaster he created. The Vice President has disappeared and general Milley head of the army seems angry at Americans expecting a better exit strategy !!! It seems that incompetence ineptness unprofessionalism & pure stupidity trickles down from Biden to his VP to the Secretary of State the Pentagon the Intelligence Services and Homeland security and the NSA & some of the army chiefs. That is what you get when you select people strictly based on everything including race & gender & ethnicity but not based on merit & experience and intelligence and capabilitiy. The media should be destroyed for their role in all of this. Biden should be impeached and the people need to rise up and unite to end this obvious destruction of their country. The Chinese could not have wished for a more incapable and incompetent and mentally challenged & clueless person to have to deal with regarding the U.S. ! The Taliban got a complete free pass after 20 years of American sacrifice of blood tears loss of life and money. Now those Chinese will own Afghanistan and its natural wealth & resources and be heroes because they know how to govern to their benefit with astute & wise leaders. I guarantee you that if Trump was in charge none of this would have taken place. How tragic Biden is for America is infinite.,political,Facebook
NOT SIMPLY IRONIC TWISTS OF HISTORY  When Jimmy Carter was President the economic situation was dark four long years. When Carter lost reelection to Ronald Reagan within 100 days of Regans leadership as President the circumstances were getting brighter with each passing day.  When Donald Trump was President the economic situation was bright four long years. When Trump lost reelection to Joe Biden within 100 days of Bidens leadership as President the circumstances have been getting darker with each passing day.  These might seem like ironic twists of history but they arent. They are clear evidence that one approach to leadership and understanding of economic policy works while the other doesnt. One is like spinach to Popeye. The other like kryptonite to Superman.  -Rev. Mark Creech,political,Facebook
"Virtual debates President Trump should refuse to have a ""virtual"" debate with Biden. It is a complete scam to cover up Biden's senility and other shortcomings.It is a plot by the corrupt democrats to hide Biden because he is not equipped to debate let alone be president.  The ""moderator "" if a debate takes place is totally partisan and prejudiced against The President. Remember these people are used to cheating and corruption and believe in knowing better than the people. For them ""the end justifies the means "" because they are a on a ""higher moral ground"" than the rest of us. After all we have had four more years of perfecting being the irredeemables and deplorables we already were in 2016. We are the racists sexists homophobes and xenophobic Americans of the country. They insist on a "" virtual debate"" for ""safety"".  Poor America ! what happened to you ?",political,Facebook
A copy of the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights hang in the waiting room of my office. All attorneys seeking admission to the New Jersey State Bar must sign an oath to support the Constitution of the United States and the State of New Jersey. As one of the original 13 colonies New Jersey representatives signed the Declaration which was adopted on July 4th 1776 and reads as follows:  When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights that among these are Life Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.  That to secure these rights Governments are instituted among Men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed  That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it and to institute new Government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to affect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence indeed will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such Government and to provide new Guards for their future security.  Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. . . .  The Declaration than goes on to list the grievances suffered by the colonies at the hands of the King of England which drove them to seek independence. The signers pledged their lives fortunes and Sacred Honor to support the Declaration relying on the protection of Divine Providence.  Why did the founders use the term all men are created equal given that slavery was legal in the colonies as it has been throughout the world during various stages of history? Racial activists such as Nikole Hannah-Jones and Ibram X. Kendi contend that the white men who drafted the Declaration did not believe their own words and that America was built on a lie. What they fail to recognize is that the founders established equality and freedom as pillars for the country to strive towards in signing the Declaration. These white men maligned by Jones and Kendi risked being charged with treason for which the penalty was death to establish an independent nation founded on the very principles which led to the abolition of slavery.  From the settlement of the first colony America has been a beacon of hope initially for Pilgrims who sought to escape religious persecution to the present day in which immigrants flock here to seek economic opportunity. Thomas Jefferson denounced slavery in the original draft of the Declaration of Independence indicating that it was a morally repugnant practice brought to the new world by King George. The text regarding slavery was removed to gain the approval of the southern colonies without which the United States would never have been formed. However Jeffersons use of the phrase all men are created equal served as a powerful springboard to ultimately abolishing human bondage in this country.  Like the human beings which inhabit it America is imperfect struggling to reach its goals sometimes succeeding occasionally failing but always striving to be better. Approximately three-quarters of a million Americans died in a Civil War less than 100 years after signing of the Declaration of Independence to end the horror of slavery. After the Civil War African Americans continued to suffer from oppression particularly in the then Democrat-controlled South under Jim Crow laws which segregated the races and enshrined discrimination. Progress could not be stopped though. Whites and blacks served together in the military fighting two World Wars. They marched and bled together in the 1960s to force the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The aptly named Supreme Court decision of Loving vs. Virginia was issued in 1967 striking down state laws which banned interracial marriages. The 1970s marked the start of the post-civil rights movement era during which African Americans made great strides in academia business and politics. In 1983 Martin Luther King Day was declared the first new federal holiday since the 1940s by President Reagan. During his tenure from 1993 - 2001 President Clinton focused on issues of equality and issued an apology to the families of 399 black men impacted by the Tuskegee syphilis experiment in which the public health service failed to inform them of their diagnosis or provide them with treatment for syphilis to study the long-term effects of the disease. President George W. Bush appointed more people of color to top-tier cabinet roles than any other president naming General Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice to lead the State Department among other cabinet members. Americans of all races creeds and colors came together in solidarity after the tragedy of 9-11. In 2008 we elected our first black President Barack Obama who was re-elected to a second term in 2012. In 2018 President Trump signed a prison reform law which had been lobbied for by civil rights leaders for years. One year later President Trump pledged that the federal government would permanently provide funding of more than $250 million annually to the nations historically black universities. In short our county has made incredible progress towards the goal of upholding equality and liberty for all.  Opportunists such as Jones and Kendi ignore the enormous advancements made in race relations over the past 150 years and seek to demonize America in the present day for long-ago outlawed crimes against humanity. According to the Center for Global Justice there are as many as forty million people still living in various forms of bondage today including domestic servitude forced labor child labor debt bondage forced marriage human trafficking and descent-based slavery in other parts of the world. Yet it is only America which continues to be labeled by some as systemically racist.  Why focus on America when the evil of slavery still exists in the world? Because the United States is a shining example of the success of capitalism which has raised more people out of abject poverty than any other political or economic system. Given the high standards of living in the United States Americans have never developed a strong sense of class consciousness. Most citizens believe in the American dream: that one can transcend their origins through hard work. It was thus difficult for Marxist intellectuals to agitate for a workers revolution here. Now neo-Marxists are taking another crack at it by implementing critical theories which uses several intersectional groups rather than economic class as a method of dividing citizens for the purpose of deconstructing classical liberal Western institutions and replacing them with an atheist Marxist value system.  Critical race theory known as CRT is an insidious legal hypothesis which has been festering and growing in our universities since the early 1980s. It instructs people to view the world entirely through a lens of race. Under CRT it is unacceptable to be color-blind  the most important characteristic of an individual is their skin color under this theory and individuals are seen as members of either the oppressed or oppressor class. It also suggests that people of color lack agency to forge their own destiny cruelly undermining their confidence by labeling them as perpetual victims.  The adherents of CRT do not hide their true goal. One of the promoters of this mindset Ibram X. Kendi openly states In order to truly be antiracist you also have to truly be anti-capitalist. The aim of CRT not simply to teach a complete and accurate history of the injustices which occurred in the United States. Rather the goal is to divide us as a country to facilitate the tearing down our core institutions including capitalism to create an unattainable utopian vision of absolute equity.  CRT is not the only critical theory gaining in popularity  it is part of the larger Critical Social Justice movement which divides society into different groups based upon race gender ethnicity sexual preference and disability. According to Critical Social Justice straight white people (men in particular) are oppressors who must be shunned. Purveyors of the critical theories believe in the collective guilt of all members of the supposed oppressor class regardless of their individual innocence and encourage separate spaces for people of color. In other words these theories make generalizations based upon immutable characteristics  exactly the type of discrimination the civil rights movement sought to stamp out. Such segregation and collective guilt violate the basic principles of justice and equality enshrined in the Constitution and undermines our strength as one nation.  It is undeniable that there are still ignorant people in the world who are racists sexists and homophobic. Such discrimination was outlawed long ago and we must continue to fight against it wherever it rears its ugly head. Civil rights attorneys around the country are prepared to file lawsuits against on behalf of victims and to overturn any laws or policies which discriminate based on an immutable characteristic. However doing battle against specific instances of injustice is a far different proposition than dividing all of society by hierarchies of intersectional groups for the purpose of tearing down our institutions.  The Critical Social Justice movement uses the buzz word equity in the curriculum it has been pushing on corporations and educational institutions. The term seems to be an innocuous and even laudable goal for society. However it requires a deeper analysis to understand why it is not. The American founding fathers specifically used the term equality rather than equity in the Declaration and Constitution. While the words sound similar their meanings are very different. Equality under the law refers to the protection of the rights of the individual. By contrast those who seek equity are concerned with collective groups of people and believe that justice is only achieved when every group has attained the same outcome as opposed to being provided the same opportunity. Regardless of their skin color religion gender or sexual orientation all individuals have unique skill sets intelligence levels natural talents upbringings social financial advantages/disadvantages and aspirations. Absolute equity of outcome is thus virtually impossible to track. It is even harder to achieve.  Since absolute equity can never occur naturally it may only be attained by sheer force  taking from one individual and giving it to another. It is therefore the antithesis of the traditional American notion of equality and freedom -- and will necessarily result in totalitarianism. The Marxist goal of equity attributes malice to all members of the supposed oppressor class with or without evidence and requires active discrimination based on skin color and/or sexual orientation to alleviate unproven discrimination. Massive government power would thus be necessary to achieve equity through race-based redistribution of wealth active discrimination suppression of free speech of those who disagree and omnipotent bureaucratic authority to carry it out.  The American experiment started with the principal that all men were endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights meaning that our rights emanate from God by virtue of our membership in the human race. Our rights to life liberty and happiness are thus not granted by any government. In Federalist paper no. 51 James Madison pointed out that if men were angels no government would be necessary. Since the potential for evil runs through every human heart it is necessary to establish law administered by government to protect citizens from one another and secure our rights. However we must always guard against the government gaining too much power especially in the hands of unelected bureaucrats who are not accountable to the people. If those who believe in the Marxist goal of equity continue to accrue power in our government I fear that citizens who believe in individual rights and responsibilities will seek to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their security. Let us hope that this drastic step is unnecessary so that America may continue being that bright shining city on the hill providing freedom and prosperity to all.

99 years ago Tulsa faced one of the darkest moments in our citys history. White rioters burned down Black Wall Street our nations most affluent black neighborhood in the worst act of racial violence American has ever seen. This is the most shameful chapter in our citys history.  Nearly a century has passed but racial inequality is still alive and well in the United States. The injustice done to George Floyd and his family is reprehensible. Records show that this bad cop had a history of excessive force incidents  he should not have been on the police force in the first place. I join President 's call for a full investigation and I pray justice is served.  Our nation is hurting that much is crystal clear. We are currently facing unrest unlike any weve seen since the 1960s. We have a right to be angry and I applaud those around the country who have engaged in peaceful protests. This weekend we had multiple peaceful demonstrations around Tulsa. While many of our countrys cities are on fire protesters in Tulsa worked hard to keep the peace protect our city and stop out-of-state agitators from inciting violence.  I support the Tulsans who marched this weekend and I support those who attended similar demonstrations around the country. I cannot however sanction or support the destruction of property. Businesses in our country have never been in a more vulnerable position. We are just beginning to reopen get our local economies running again we cannot sabotage our own recovery. Fortunately this was not the case in Tulsa but Ive seen countless small business owners across the country including many minority and immigrant business owners watch their lifes work go up in flames in response to a crime committed by four white cops in Minneapolis.  Now is a time for unity to bring people of all backgrounds and beliefs together in pursuit of justice. This is not the time to incite violence and divide us further. We want a more equal fair America. Burning down our communities only exacerbates inequality in our most vulnerable populations. I pray for peace in our country soon.  We are incredibly strong as a people and we must not let evil divide us like it did 99 years ago. Now is the time for strength and leadership. We must do everything we can to prevent the further destruction of our communities.  May the God of endurance and encouragement grant you to live in such harmony with one another in accord with Christ Jesus.  Romans 15:5,political,Facebook
FBI Case #272D-BA-3065729. After an FBI agent opens up a case he then has to write a report every 3 months until the case is prosecuted. So its a real pain to the agent if he doesnt believe he has the evidence to prosecute. In the last debate Trump called Joe Biden the big guy and Biden said there wasnt any corruption with him or his family. The FBI opened up a case on Hunter Biden and the numbers mean it has to do with money laundering (272D) on an international basis. So whats the case about? Go back in time before 2014 and you find that a Minister in Ukraine essentially stole mega-millions of natural gas leases. The government then changed much like when the Obama/Biden administration was replaced by the Trump/Pence administration. As time progressed a prosecutor started asking questions about these natural gas leases of Burisma. Joe Biden travels to the Ukraine and that follows with Hunter Biden & Devon Archer being put on Burismas board and being paid tens of thousands each month. This is then followed by Joe Biden going to the Ukraine and saying if the new administration doesnt fire the prosecutor who is looking into Burisma & Hunter Ukraine wont get the billion dollars in loan guarantees from the US Government. Since payments to Hunter go through several Countries including Latvia this is an international money laundering scheme. Emails indicate that 10% of the money was to go to the big guy which was confirmed to be Joe Biden. Other Democrats are also involved including David Leiter former chief of staff for John Kerry and Chris Heinz Kerrys stepson. Many more ties are exposed. How do we know this is true and not a smear? Hunter Biden has thousands of emails on his laptops. They were damaged and he took them in to be repaired. As part of the contract the repairman took ownership after 90 days unless he was paid. So after the 90 days with repeated attempts to contact Hunter he took ownership. He looked at what was on the laptop and became concerned. He made 4 copies and then gave the laptop in 2019 to the FBI. After no apparent action by the FBI he sent copies to some members of Congress and indirectly to Rudy Giuliani. Rudy had it verified by comparing dates and events to know documents. Rudy gave a copy to the Nations oldest newspaper the New York Post. They independently verified the information and then published 2 articles on what they found. They also mentioned there were many photos of Hunter with an underage girl. Then Hunters attorney attempted to get the laptop back again proving the laptop belonged to Hunter. Meanwhile a former business partner of Hunter named Cooper was in jail lamenting how he was convicted and Hunter and Devon were not. So he contacted Peter Sweitzer and authorized him to take possession of tens of thousands of his emails. Peter found incriminating evidence that corroborated the Post articles. Finally another member of the Biden re-election campaign Bobulinski has come forward and is also corroborating the NY Post evidence. There is a lot more to it and much can be found at under Dans episode 1375. So in summary in the last debate Joe Biden said there was no corruption involving him or his family. He says this while details of corruptions are emerging from the open floodgates. FBI case #272D-BA-3065729 opened emails flood from Hunter Bidens laptop are confirmed by several sources no one denies their authenticity; all pointing to a pay-for-play corrupt Biden family.

Guyanese are the best cooks hands down!  Some of you might already know that I love Guyanese food bad-bad. I said before and I say it again; Guyanese are the best cooks hands down period. Yall hear meh? Meh seh PERIOD!  Jamaicans are celebrated for a lot of things. Usain Bold run away and leff everybody hopping the other day. Up to now some ah dem athletes still nah a figure out is how come them nah a win dem 100 meters race. Dem also got a trump card name Bob Marley in dem back pocket and are rightly very proud of him. Also because of some lil burn up black barbecue chicken with some hot-hot jerk sauce dem think dem is the biggest cooks in de place. Sometimes the jerk chicken does have so much pepper in it that is like jerk pepper with lil chicken. The first time that I eat jerk chicken me tongue get numb-numb with pain. Me eye start watering and I get heart palpitations. I start see dark and me mouth start dribble so hot this jerk chicken was. Like I said is jerk pepper with some chicken in it. Dem Jamaicans is think that they is some a de biggest cooks in de place. Yuh know wuh ah sehing?  Lemme wash me mouth pon dem Trinis lil bit too. Them can cook a passable pouri even though them make a mistake and call it a roti. Somebody needs to tell them that de thing name pouri and not no roti. Yes I said it and Ill say it again it name pouri and nah no roti. They can make a passable pouri. They make a slightly passable roti too even though them mek a mistake with that too and call it a buss-up-shut. It passable I give them that you know you have to give Jack his jacket. One thing about Trinidadians too is that THEY think that they are some of the biggest cooks in de place too. Yuh know wuh ah sehing wid dat too?  The only other Caribbean country that I does hear deh beating dem own cooking drum is Barbados. They have a confused fish that does not know that it is a fish and think that it is a bird. It always jumping out of the water and trying to fly. So as not to hurt its delicate sensibilities dem Bajans does call it a flying fish. Somebody needs to tell dem Bajans that yuh is either a fish or yuhj is a bird. Yuh cyant be both budday. De fish got a set a bones and does deh boring up yuh gums. Heaven forbid yuh swallow a fish bone. Is ning-ning yuh gun see ning-ning. Ah jus mekking laugh de fish does actually taste nice man. Dem does cook it up with cornmeal cou-cou as their national dish. Is dem national dish so I cant bad talk it too much you know how?  Now I is a man dat does bad talk Guyanese fuh one-one thing that them does do tuh yuh know. A good example is talking wrang English. I ent mean Creolese yuh know. Creloese is Guyanese national speak. People is doan know wuh we deh sehing when we start talk Creolese um does twass dem up. What I am talking about is trying to impress people with your command of the English language when you know good and well yuh ent got no dam good command of the English language. People would respect you more if you were to talk to them in your native Creolese rather that to start spouting a set of nonsense with green verbs here incorrect pronunciation there unfortunate sentence construction and misapplied syntax and diction. Another thing that I does bad talk Guyanese men for is the big set a slippers dem does deh wearing. Everywhere yuh look a Guyanese man or boy got on a damn slippers. Big man lil boy it ent mek no difference everybody wearing slippers. Whats up with the slippers budday? Since when slippers became the national footwear of choice for Guyanese men??? When I went home to Guyana the other day I deh feeling shame-shame because I was the only man that ent deh wearing a set a slippers. I felt like a foreigner for wearing a track boots and not the ubiquitous slippers that seem to be standard wear or standard fare for Guyanese men.  Arright leh we talk food now. Guyanese ah proud a we food bad-bad. Hear nah when I used to live in GT I used to wuk for the Guyana Public Communication Agency. Ah think dem does call it GINA now. A part a me wuk was to set up meetings between drainage and irrigation engineers from international aid agencies and their intended beneficiaries. (farmers) When these engineers draw up new drainage and irrigation plans for a particular area I used to go into the community and speak with farmers and invite them to meet with the engineers in the said villages. Was big meeting going on with a set a food that I had to organize with the villagers for the engineers and everybody to eat up and suh after the meeting when there were informal conversations going on. Well hear nah I organized a particular meeting at Ruby on de West Coast food deh dora-dora. Well let me tell allyuh I had the best curry chicken I EVER eat. Yall hear meh? Now Guyanese in general know how fuh cook a good curry chicken. Even if yuh cyant cook nuttin else yuh cud cook curry chicken. I know a man who ent know how fuh boil hot water good yuh know but de man cud cook curry chicken. Rice easy fuh cook right? Well I know people who cyant cook rice widout burning it up but (wait for it wait for it) dem know how fuh cook curry chicken. I know a girl she married bout four year wid husband and bout three children but she does gaff fuh call she mother fuh ask she how fuh boil egg. Meh ent lying yuh know.  Even she self know how fuh cook curry chicken.  Yuh could get a good curry chicken without even trying trying all over the place. Everybody just 4know how to cook a good curry chicken. So when yuh see I seh that I will never forget this particular curry chicken till I dead yuh gaff fuh know how good dis curry chicken was. Yuh just watch this chicken and um falling off de bone. This is the kind a curry chicken that yuh does gaff fuh shy way yuh spoon and eat um with yuh hand um so good. Dem had a man walking round with a big-big bowl wid white rice sharing it out. This rice white-white and loose-loose. De man I did really interested in was de man walking round wid an even bigger bowl dat look like a young 45 gallon drum. This young drum had de chicken curry in um and de man did sharing it out as he walked around. I talking dis story and is dribble I deh hey dribbling still. Yuh know how when a beautiful woman dress up nice-nice wid a coco-cola bottle shape and she sashay into a room and how both man and woman eye does deh following she? (men dribbling and woman vex-vex that somebody look better than them) Heheh. Well is jus suh everybody eye deh following de man wid de curry bowl de man walking round proud-proud wid a big smile pon he face. Me like curry bad man. Ayuh doan even get me started pon seven curry. I proper like pope Indian wedding fuh dat. Hehehe.  Couple Caribbean country got a dish that they call Oil Down I know that Grenada Trinidad and Jamaica all have a version of this dish. Jamaicans does also call provision food (as in Leh ah get a food deh nah? or Weh ah cud get a good food fuh buy?) Everybody in the world know that this dish really name Met-tem-gee every country which do not call it by this name is calling it the wrong name. Yall tell them I she suh. Met-tem-gee bad fuh days (as we used to say as kids) Dash in some fat fluffy duff in dat bad boy and is the next thing to heaven. Some people does add lil salt fish or smoke fish in it too. Of course yuh gaff fuh put in couple whole young ochro too. Dem other countries dont know what they are doing. They should send some cooks to Guyana to learn how to cook it. Dem does try though bless their little hearts.  Man we got nuff nuff dishes that we would cook in Guyana that are outstanding. Chow Mein is another one. Other countries does call it noodles of course you know that they are calling it the wrong name right? Even Chinese come to Guyana and setup cook shop and they learn how to season their chow mein/noodles and fry rice the Guyana way. Guyanese Chinese fry rice taste better than every other fry rice that I have ever eaten. I have eaten fry rice in at least eight countries and none of them taste like a Guyanese Chinee fry rice. Even the Chinese that have probably been cooking fried rice for centuries in China change up their recipe when they came to Guyana. They Guyanize the fry rice baptize it and no other fry rice could match it.  Guyanese have a way of taking other countries dishes and turning around and cooking it better than them. Spaghetti and meatballs is one such food. I hated spaghetti and meatballs when I tasted it in the USA. Now I generally do not like to make pronouncements on anything or any issue after my first engagement with it. I would have to try it at least twice before I make a pronouncement or come to a conclusion. My reasoning is that the person or institution that cooked the dish might have been having an off day the day that I ate their offering. If it tasted the same way after eating it twice then to me that is probably the way that you/they cook it normally. Spaghetti and meatballs was solidly on my Not to do list until I tasted the spaghetti and meatballs that a Guyanese cooked. Budday!!! It tasted like a completely different dish budday to the extent that it should have been baptized and given a different name.  Have you ever eaten a grocery store burger patty in a homemade beef or turkey burger? Um ent got no taste meh boy (or meh girl as the case may be) If you do not Guyanize that burger meat before you grill it and try to make a homemade burger you are going to hate it too. Do I have a witness in here? Hear dis ting nah I went to Toronto Canada for a Caribana carnival celebration. We duck in by an Indian lady house and she did grilling some burgers in she back yard. Ow meh Lawd I had to ask de woman is wuh kinda cow dis burger come from. It could not have come from a regular cow and taste this good. This woman put she fingers she hand she foot or something in this burger meat. Budday I have never before nor have I ever since tasted ANY burger commercial or otherwise that tasted anywhere near this Indian woman burger. This lady Guyanized this burger and spoil burgers forever for me from any/everybody else. Was a Guyanese woman dat! Guyanese can cook bad-bad.  We gun gaff de odda half next time.  --A J Massay,political,Facebook
Yesterday I had the honor of meeting with First Lady Malania Trump and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos to discuss children's mental health. I was inspired by the First Lady's compassion and her deep concern for the psychological and emotional well-being of American children. It was reassuring to learn that the First Lady and Secretary DeVos are supporting social and emotional learning by diligently working with educators to help prepare students for transitioning back to school during these challenging times. The Moodsters are committed to supporting their efforts by teaching kids resilience strategies that may serve them now and in the years to come.,political,Facebook
PRISON FOOD for the MIND  2020 THE Directors Cut  It would only be fitting that ''THE YEAR 2020'' be the opening synopsis of discussion it goes without saying that 2020 in one form or another has left a undeniable imprint on humanity. Mind body heart and spirit has been touched and scarred and in many case's wounds mentally emotionally and physically will never heal. 2020 was a year unlike any mankind has ever witnessed even as I state the obvious the strange thing is it still feels like a understatement. What made 2020 so unforgettable goes without saying but I'll say it anyway the Big Bad and Ugly Corona Virus better know as Covid19. Covid did the unthinkable your race religion and economic status was of no consequence to this juggernaut of a virus saint's and sinners world wide on seven continent's were not immune to the possibility of ones own mortality. For the first time in my life I witnessed a situation that Everyone the emphasis is on Everyone has had to adjust to this new world order. Rich poor good bad beautiful ugly tall short incarcerated not incarcerated educated uneducated liberal conservative Democrat Republican independent blackbrownyellowredwhite and old and young alike and everyone in between are in the cross hair's of a common enemy.  This destroyer of men women and children has extinguished thousands of life's in epic proportions never before seen in modern day history. This notorious ''villain'' Covid19 has bullied the entire world into a matrix of uncertainty. Never before in mankind's illustrious history dating back to the start of civilization has every country's government and all it citizens world wide in all seven continent's shared a level playing field regarding a singular or numerous circumstance be it wealth power oil democracy or healthcare. The list goes on and on nonstop etcetera etceteraetcetera illustrating massive inequities of resources between the wealthiest countries and the poorest countries. Covid19 ''knocked out'' all that history and accomplished what ''fairness'' never succeeded in. What might that be you may ponder........ What might that be you may ask? The answer is simple their were no ''favorites'' or ''underdogs'' when dealing with this plague every country started at ground zero. Meaning superpower countries third world countries and all countries stretched across seven continent's were in the same starting position with equal opportunity to live or die.The best analogy to follow this train of thought is to imagine that every country in the entire world has a automobile that will be entered into a worldwide race envision NASCAR style racing at the Daytona 500 with a caveat of provisions to make interesting.  In a vast majority of the populations worldly mind based off logic and perception one would assume the richest country on earth would win this '''race''. One might expect the United States to enter the race with the fastest technically advanced racing machine the world has ever witnessed. In betting circles the U.S would be a 2 to 1 favorite to win the race. And on the other hand many people would assume a poor county like Wuhan would stand little to no chance of winning this race and would be a long shot and 40 to 1 underdog. The thing about overwhelming favorites is they rarely live up to the hype and the thing about underdog's is they are usually underestimated which motivates them to ascend to greater heights and become victorious. Covid19 is real it's not a game it's not a sport in any literal stretch of the imagination. Metaphorically speaking I used NASCAR as a analogy because in many way's when the citizens of the world were notified that a alien infection known as Cornoavirus entered the atmosphere and was extremely contagious the nations of the world started a ''race'' with life or death implications. As I aforementioned in the chapter every nation in the world and it's citizens started in the same starting position and wealth and power would not cloak countries and it's citizens in immunity against death and destruction anymore then it would poverty stricken and powerless countries.  As of January the first 2021 a new year is upon us. And a entire year has passed since the race against Covid-19 and it's deadly aftermath. The United States of America the richest and most powerful country in the world has seen more deaths of it citizens then any country in the world. More then 350000 plus people in the U.S.A. have become victims of this virus and lost their life's. How did we get to this point ? How has the richest and most powerful country allowed this to happen ? How has United States of America become the pandemic epicenter of the world ? When did America become some American's worst Nightmare realized ? To answer these questions first we must dissect our brains from the very beginning. Close your eye's and let your mind drift back to any given day in January 2020. Can you remember the first time you wore a mask and tried to apply 6 feet social distance to your daily life ? How did you feel about having to wear a mask and having to practice social distancing in public places ? I know many Americans were skeptical and believed that mask and social distancing was a over reaction by state and government official's due to the pandemic that was occurring in China at the time. Many Americans decided to disregard mask and social distancing guidelines and ordinances altogether. Are you one of those American people ? Be honest we're you one of millions of people that deified science and logic and continued a reckless and blatant disregard of human life ?  For some the self reflection questionnaire may come across in a harsh judgemental and accusatory tone but this not my intention. My intention is not to point finger's and lay blame. My intention is not to transport those who answered yes to the question's down a road trip of guilt trip. My questions are valid and important exercise if we are to understand how America became the Biggest ''Loser''. I'm sure my terminology of the word loser attached to America will entice my fair share of detractors who will argue toothed and nail that America is ''winning'' this war against Covid; The population of people in America who fall in this category of thinking share at least one common thread of unity ninety nine percent of these people are Donald Trump supporters and loyalists. In this moment you may be asking yourself where is he going with this and why is it is relevant to know if someone is a Trump supporter in regards to Covid-19. If we are to fully grasps and understand how the richest and most powerful country in the world has 350000 plus casualties we must devour and digest all the ingredients and factor's of humanity that has the nation on brink of no return !  One plus One equals Two Two plus Two equals Four Donald Trump plus Donald Trump equals Division. These mathematics are examples of universal truth. None will dispute my first two examples of truth but about 74000000 people give or take will dispute vehemently how I derived at my third example of truth. To these Trumpeter's I would say numbers don't lie. To these Trumpeter's I would say your mind and conscious are deaf and blind if you can not and will not acknowledge truth. I'm sure Trumpeter's at this very moment are shaking their head's still not convinced. For the sake of argument I will very graciously patiently and meticulously ''show my work'' like a high school math test.....Donald Trump is a demigod to his supporter's and voter's. Donald Trump is divisive and decisive in his agenda to divide the nation into Three section's White America Black America and Hispanic America. Donald Trump succeeded in dividing the country socially with blatant racial rhetoric inspired speeches tweets and propaganda. Donald Trump's toolbox of tool's helped him accomplish division in this country are the same exact tool's that founded this ''Great'' country 500 years ago. Racism Hate Lie's Fear and minimizing the life and liberty of people of color. ''Make America Great Again'' a slogan designed to promote hate and Racism. Donald Trump plus Donald Trump equals division.  Wow is what I'm thinking at this very moment......... Life imitates art is a expression I've heard before in passing but never thought twice about but now I understand the sentiment. Dear Reader's let me explain these surreal emotions I am experiencing.The previous page I wrote about how Donald Trump plus Donald Trump equals division from there I unleashed a logical spiel about why I believed this to be a unquestioned truth. Coincidentally I began writing the previous page at literally 6:13 a.m. on January 6 2021 the same day the Senate in Washington D.C. convened to vote yay or nay to certificate the electoral college vote regarding the presidential election. Who knew that January 6 2021 would be a historical infamous shameful and none to surprising day in the illustrious ''Great'' American history. For four years Donald Trump has used every trick up his sleeve to corrupt the hearts minds and the will of the American people. It is said that every action has a reaction; It is said that what you put in a relationship is what you get out a relationship; Hate racism stereotypes and intolerance is what he ''fed'' the American people and seems as if sixty percent of white American gobbled up the propaganda with a ravenous appetite and craved and begged unapologetically for seconds................and as it stands currently their hunger is insatiable and will never be satisfied............Donald Trump action's fractured the Spirit of America and divided the Soul's.  by American X,political,Facebook

IMPORTANT take-aways from today's Supreme Court decision on #DACA:  1. The Court did not reach any policy conclusion on DACA or its termination. The majority only said Trump did not go about terminating it the right way. 2. Trump could try to end DACA again. If he does the fight to keep it will start over again in court. 3. Technically until Trump says otherwise things go back to the way they were before the attempted termination of DACA. That means if you never applied before but qualify right now you technically can apply. That means if you want to apply for advance parole (a travel document) but were unable to before due to the attempted DACA termination you technically can apply. 4. We should know a lot more in a few days.  MIL does NOT charge a consultation fee to screen for DACA or DACA benefits! Never have never will.

"A ""MUST READ"" For Voters!  Key Excerpts from the Statement of former Trump Defense Secretary  Gen. James Mattis'  By CNN Updated Jun 3 2020  (CNN) - Former Secretary of Defense James Mattis castigated President Donald Trump as ""the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people"" in a forceful rebuke of his former boss as nationwide protests have intensified over the death of George Floyd.  ...  Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American peopledoes not even pretend to try. Instead he tries to divide us. We are witnessing the consequences of three years of this deliberate effort. We are witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership. We can unite without him drawing on the strengths inherent in our civil society. This will not be easy as the past few days have shown but we owe it to our fellow citizens; to past generations that bled to defend our promise; and to our children.  We can come through this trying time stronger and with a renewed sense of purpose and respect for one another. The pandemic has shown us that it is not only our troops who are willing to offer the ultimate sacrifice for the safety of the community. Americans in hospitals grocery stores post offices and elsewhere have put their lives on the line in order to serve their fellow citizens and their country. We know that we are better than the abuse of executive authority that we witnessed in Lafayette Square. We must reject and hold accountable those in office who would make a mockery of our Constitution. At the same time we must remember Lincoln's ""better angels"" and listen to them as we work to unite.  Only by adopting a new pathwhich means in truth returning to the original path of our founding idealswill we again be a country admired and respected at home and abroad.

"BEFORE EMBRACING AMERICA-FIRST AGENDA DAVID PERDUE WAS AN OUTSOURCING EXPERT  (Share if you believe that Georgians should know the sad truth about their Senator DA2020)  Mr. Perdue who faces one of two runoff elections in Georgia that will determine control of the Senate built a business record that shifted manufacturing and jobs overseas.  By Stephanie Saul Richard Fausset and Michael LaForgia  Jan. 1 2021 Updated 1:24 p.m. ET  The biographical video from Senator David Perdues first campaign in 2014 celebrated a narrative arc that many fellow Georgians either related to or have aspired to: the story of a humble boy from rural America whose hard work catapulted him into a global business career navigating free markets and faraway lands all the while gathering stores of wisdom and wealth.  The embrace of global commerce has been a hallmark of modern Georgia showcased in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics dissected by the novelist Tom Wolfe and promoted by among others Mr. Perdues Nafta-loving cousin Sonny Perdue governor from 2003 to 2011. Three years later in his maiden run for office David Perdue would boast of his international experience as a consultant and chief executive while speaking to a gathering of Republicans in Bibb County close to his middle Georgia hometown.  Theres only one candidate in this race thats ever lived outside the United States Mr. Perdue said. How can you bring value to a debate about the economy unless you have any understanding about the free-enterprise system and what it takes to compete in the global economy?  Now facing one of a pair of Jan. 5 runoff elections in Georgia that will determine control of the Senate Mr. Perdue has continued to make his global business experience the essence of his brand. But that has highlighted the contradictions that emerge  in his career and in his character but also in his party and his region  as he embraces the populist America-first strains of Trumpism.  The man who has lately voiced support for some of President Trumps signature tariffs built his career as an unapologetic free-trading practitioner of the outsourcing arts. As a top executive at companies including Reebok Sara Lee and Dollar General he was often deeply involved in the shift of manufacturing and jobs to low-wage factories in China and other Asian countries.  A review of that business record shows a man who achieved significant successes making millions managing complex periods of corporate growth and change and creating domestic jobs particularly at Dollar General. But there were also disappointments like the failed trucking business he ran with Sonny Perdue and his fruitless effort to rescue a company called Pillowtex that brought heartbreak to a North Carolina mill town. And while the senator often speaks of having led the Reebok turnaround as president of the companys flagship brand in the early 2000s he moved on from the company after a rival who today questions Mr. Perdues contribution to the turnaround was installed above him.  The man who spent much of his life broadening his horizons took to the stage at a Trump rally in Macon before Election Day and mocked Senator Kamala Harriss first name mispronouncing it with an exaggerated stumble that to critics amounted to crude racism. His campaign has called it an innocent mispronunciation.  The man who dons a faded denim jacket to reinforce his connection to everyday Georgians has a record of aloofness with an aversion to holding town hall meetings and a thin skin for tough questions. Now he has chosen a further withdrawal declining to participate in additional debates after one in which his Democratic opponent Jon Ossoff called him a crook for his prolific stock-trading while in the Senate.  Mr. Perdue did not respond to requests to be interviewed for this article. In response to written questions his campaign issued a statement that said in part Throughout his four decades working in the real world before being elected to the Senate David Perdue led American companies that saved and created tens of thousands of American jobs.  As when he first ran for office six years ago Mr. Perdue who is 71 regularly invokes those decades in business to style himself the ultimate Washington outsider though it was his cousin the former governor who gave him his entree to politics and helped nurture his ascent.  Taking aim at his 33-year-old opponent who runs a London-based documentary film company and has never held public office Mr. Perdues campaign has fixed on a $1000 payment from a Hong Kong media company to charge that Mr. Ossoff had a two-year working relationship with the Chinese Communist Party.  In its statement to The New York Times most of which dwelled on Mr. Ossoff the Perdue campaign called it ridiculous to compare the senators leadership in American companies with Jon Ossoffs foreign-owned company with shady ties to the Chinese government. (Mr. Ossoffs spokeswoman dismissed that claim as one of the most laughable smear campaigns in Georgia history.)  Mr. Perdues campaigns biographical video meanwhile has been refreshed for 2020. Edited out is a section that showed the senator posing with his wife on Chinas Great Wall.  From a Watermelon Patch to the World Mr. Perdue grew up in Warner Robins a small city about 100 miles south of Atlanta home to Robins Air Force Base. Airmen coming and going from foreign deployments connected the city to the wider world.  But life could still move to rural rhythms. Mr. Perdue traces his roots back to nearby Bonaire a farming community where Perdues settled in the early 1800s. Mr. Perdue recalls picking watermelons on a family-owned farm alongside Sonny who would become Mr. Trumps agriculture secretary in 2017.  While farming was a family pursuit Mr. Perdues parents followed a different path  education. David Perdue Sr. eventually became county schools superintendent.  Mr. Perdue would later go on to extol his fathers leadership in desegregating the countys schools but the historical record provides a different picture revealing the school system employed delay tactics until the N.A.A.C.P. sued and a court ordered it to comply.  The future senator graduated from high school in 1968 two years before the schools were fully integrated. Standout student varsity athlete and class president he was awarded a coveted appointment to the Air Force Academy.  David has those personal traits that cause him to be recognized as a person of worth his high school principal Milton Sutherlin wrote in a recommendation letter. His character is that always of a gentleman and he holds high those Christian ideals that speak well of his home training his school and his community.  But while the Air Force would prove a good fit for his cousin Sonny who served three years and was promoted to the rank of captain it was not so for David. He received Bs and Cs in a brief stint at the academy and by early 1969 let it be known that he wanted out.  I have realized that I have made a mistake and I do not want this type of career he wrote in January 1969 to Jack Brinkley the congressman who had sponsored him. His plan was to attend the Georgia Institute of Technology and try to play basketball.  His basketball career never materialized but Mr. Perdue would earn undergraduate and masters degrees at Georgia Tech. And over the next three decades he would position himself on the winning side of a seismic economic shift sweeping the South.  A Global Man of the New South Increasingly and inexorably the regions apparel and textile industry was turning to foreign contractors to manufacture its products. The disruption which meant thousands of layoffs for low-skilled workers in Southern mill towns was Mr. Perdues ticket to the world. He became an expert in outsourcing.  I spent most of my career doing that he would later say in a deposition.  His apprenticeship in outsourcing began while he was still in school. In 1972 he joined Kurt Salmon Associates a consulting company that had earned its reputation sending bright young engineers into Southern clothing factories to solve technical problems and boost efficiency. The company had a large Atlanta office and by the 1970s was aspiring to a more-global footprint.  The city was too. Born as a regional railroad hub Atlanta had begun adding international flights to its growing airport creating yet more opportunities for a metropolis that had already rocketed past its Southern rivals fueled by relentless civic boosterism and a reputation for racial moderation.  William Sand an engineer who worked in the Atlanta office with Mr. Perdue recalled that in the 1970s as Southern factories were beginning to close new ones were opening in Mexico and Asia. Kurt Salmon he said became experts at helping companies source product from overseas.  Mr. Perdue left in 1984 and worked at a few other places before ending up at Sara Lee which was best known for its baked goods but was also an apparel manufacturer. He was hired in 1992 to open a headquarters in Hong Kong where he lived for two years establishing operations throughout Asia from the ground up he would later say.  The ripple effects reached home. In 1994 the company eliminated thousands of jobs including 230 at its Spring City Knitting plant in Cartersville Ga. Most of the workers were women who earned $4.25 an hour sewing garments.  By that time Mr. Perdue was globe-trotting with yet another company Haggar Clothing which had chosen him to lead its international operation with one aim  increasing foreign sourcing. Within three years he had done just that boosting international production from 60 percent to 75 percent. As company plants were closed in the United States workers in Mexico performed the job for $1.50 an hour.  By 1998 Mr. Perdue was headed to Reebok which ultimately promoted him to lead its main division as it forged licensing deals with the National Football League and the National Basketball Association. Major league teams with their star power and marquee players burnished Reeboks cachet leading to its acquisition by Adidas in 2005. The manufacturing of most of the companys products was outsourced primarily to China and elsewhere in Asia.  The 2014 video produced by Mr. Perdues Senate campaign  in which he discusses licensing agreements  portrays him as the architect of Reeboks turnaround. Even in the wake of improvements in the companys business though Reeboks chairman Paul Fireman passed over Mr. Perdue for promotion to the companys No. 2 job.  In December 2001 the company announced that Mr. Perdue who as head of the Reebok brand had reported directly to Mr. Fireman would instead report to Jay Margolis who had formerly headed other brands for the company but was suddenly named chief operating officer.  Paul Fireman decided he wanted one guy to run it all from a C.O.O. point of view said Kenneth Watchmaker Reeboks chief financial officer until 2006. Thats where the two of them competed and Jay got the nod and David left after a period of time.  Mr. Margolis says that he and Mr. Fireman actually pushed out Mr. Perdue who has characterized his departure from Reebok as voluntary. I look back on David. He couldnt make decisions. He was so indecisive he couldnt move the product forward Mr. Margolis said.  As for the licensing deals Mr. Margolis said those were the brainchild of Mr. Fireman.  Mr. Fireman reached by phone said I dont remember firing him. He added: Im not challenging Jays recollection; I just dont remember myself.  Mr. Fireman did not address a question about the extent to which Mr. Perdue was involved in turning around the brands. A long time has passed since then he said. David was a good solid employee for the four or five years he was with me at a high level Mr. Fireman said. And I knew him as a good person.  Within months of Mr. Margoliss promotion Mr. Perdue was in discussions with a headhunter seeking an executive with the know-how and experience to turn around Pillowtex a troubled sheet and towel manufacturer with well-known brands in its portfolio including Cannon Fieldcrest and Royal Velvet.  Leaving behind what he would later describe as $5 million worth of in-the-money unvested Reebok stock options Mr. Perdue agreed in spring 2002 to take the job as chief executive of Pillowtex.  The company was just emerging from bankruptcy and thousands of workers at its home base in Kannapolis N.C. viewed Mr. Perdue as a potential savior according to Scott Shimizu a former executive vice president. Looking back though Mr. Shimizu said he believed Mr. Perdues inaction led to the companys demise.  The company needed to sell off assets quickly and outsource production to survive  with the possibility of retaining part of its United States work force  but Mr. Shimizu says Mr. Perdue took few steps to do either.  He didnt really help us said Mr. Shimizu. We were waiting for him to bring the Ten Commandments to us. They never came.  Mr. Perdue would later say he had been misled about the depth of the companys financial problems including a badly underfunded pension plan. He became embroiled in a dispute with Pillowtex over its failure to live up to the compensation agreement he had negotiated.  The company imploded and about 7650 people lost their jobs most of them in North Carolina. The Charlotte Observer called it the largest mass layoff in state history. The hard feelings toward Mr. Perdue were rife in Kannapolis and in 2014 his Democratic Senate opponent Michelle Nunn would release an ad set there highlighting the bitterness.  Mr. Perdue who had been at Pillowtex less than a year soon found a new opportunity that would also touch large numbers of working-class people: at Dollar General. The company boasts that 25 percent of its products retail for less than $1.  As chief executive Mr. Perdue oversaw the opening of a Hong Kong office in 2004 increasing the global sourcing that helps to provide the low everyday price our customers count on according to a company announcement. Among the global sources were manufacturers in China records show.  Low wages were another way the company controlled costs. Store managers sued the company complaining that they were not paid overtime even though they took on nonmanagerial duties unloading trucks and stocking shelves after hours. Some of their claims as well as legal complaints from female workers who said they were inequitably compensated resulted in payouts.  Dollar General flourished under Mr. Perdues leadership adding more than 2000 stores and expanding the use of coolers to stock more grocery items. Former colleagues who visited Mr. Perdue at the companys Tennessee headquarters said it was apparent he was preparing Dollar General for acquisition. In 2007 Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company announced it would purchase Dollar General for about $7 billion. It was later reported that Mr. Perdue walked away with a $42 million payout.  The Perdue family had lived in Nashvilles tony Belle Meade section but it was time to head back to Georgia where Mr. Perdue would ultimately settle on Sea Island a wealthy sanctuary on the southern coast.  The Outsider In 2010 as Sonny Perdue was finishing his second term as governor he named his cousin David to the board of the Georgia Ports Authority.  About a year later records show the cousins formed a company called Perdue Partners which in December 2012 acquired Benton Express an Atlanta-based trucking company that had operated as a regional family business for nearly 80 years. They renamed it Benton Global and pledged to reinvigorate the business by drawing on overseas connections and especially David Perdues ties to Asia according to press reports and interviews with former employees.  The Perdues installed two loyalists of the former governor in top management positions and oversaw the purchase of new tractor-trailers. But the promised new international business never materialized and the company already suffering from flagging revenues struggled to pay its bills. It closed abruptly in 2015 leaving more than 500 truck drivers clerks and terminal workers unemployed.  As a member of the ports authority board Mr. Perdue voted repeatedly on infrastructure improvements that might have benefited his trucking business The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. A spokesman for Mr. Perdue said at the time that none of the votes posed a conflict of interest or aided Mr. Perdue financially.  In 2013 Georgias senior senator Saxby Chambliss announced that he would not stand for re-election the next year. In David Perdues telling he drove to see his cousin and tried to convince him to run. Well he told me he didnt feel led to do so but then he said I should consider running Mr. Perdue later recalled in an interview.  When Mr. Perdue decided to run he recruited top aides from his cousins campaign staff. Davids team was Sonnys team said Jack Kingston a longtime Republican congressman who also sought the vacant seat. Sonny Perdue he said was very instrumental in his cousins campaign.  For all that David Perdue branded himself the outsider the man with the real-world business savvy needed to effect change. The Republican primary was crowded with well-known and seasoned politicians and Mr. Perdue attacked them for their seasoning portraying them in ads as ineffectual mewling babies.  ""We were hoping that we could find an Achilles heel  hes lazy hes going to say something stupid Mr. Kingston said of the campaign. We found him to be pretty disciplined and hard-working. I have to give him good marks.  After defeating Mr. Kingston in a primary runoff Mr. Perdue went on to face Ms. Nunn an executive at a nonprofit whose father Sam Nunn was a former Democratic senator from Georgia. Though both candidates benefited from famous family names Ms. Nunn thought she might gain the upper hand by focusing on the negative effects of Mr. Perdues embrace of globalism.  A month before the election a transcript surfaced of a nine-year-old deposition in which Mr. Perdue said he had spent most of my career outsourcing. Questioned by reporters Mr. Perdue replied that he was proud of that record. This is a part of American business part of any business he said adding People do that all day.  Ms. Nunn pressed the point in her ads and on the debate stage. But she was the underdog and 2014 proved to be a bad year for Democrats burdened by a lack of enthusiasm for President Barack Obama and his signature legislation the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Perdue blasted Mr. Obamas handling of the Ebola virus crisis and vowed to repeal Obamacare. He practically waltzed to victory.  The outsider arrived on Capitol Hill pushing a term-limit plan and railing against career politicians to the annoyance of his fellow Georgia Republican Senator Johnny Isakson according to two people familiar with the views of Mr. Isakson who had spent many years in politics and was gearing up for a third Senate run.  The record Mr. Perdue built was reliably conservative. He submitted a far-fetched  and critics said regressive  proposal to replace income taxes with sales taxes on goods and services. He proposed limits on the ability of immigrants to sponsor family members instead giving priority to college-educated young people with high-paying jobs.  In the beginning he also spoke and voted as one would expect a free trader to do. In 2015 he voted to give Mr. Obama enhanced powers to negotiate big trade agreements including the Trans-Pacific Partnership the most substantial trade accord since the North American Free Trade Agreement of the 1990s.  But Mr. Perdue was also early to see the potential in Mr. Trump who offered a kind of mirror reflection of Mr. Perdues own political persona as chief executive change agent. The two men reportedly met at Trump Tower during Mr. Perdues 2014 run. And after Mr. Trumps inauguration the senator could be unrestrained in his praise at one point comparing the new president to Winston Churchill. This guy I think is a historic person of destiny at a time and place in America when weve got to make a right-hand turn here Mr. Perdue said.  Mr. Perdue and his fellow Republicans quickly had to grapple with the presidents determination to break the partys mold on global trade. Three days into his tenure Mr. Trump tore up the Trans-Pacific Partnership calling it a rape of our country.  Although Mr. Perdues campaign has said that he consistently supported the presidents America-first trade policies the senator spoke out in 2017 against a Trump-backed plan to impose a border adjustment tax that would have raised taxes on companies that import goods into the United States. A year later he criticized the presidents plan to impose steep tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum calling for a more targeted strategy.  But by late 2019 as Mr. Perdues re-election bid on a ticket with Mr. Trump loomed he seemed more amenable to the presidents approach.  The tariffs are creating the opportunity for people to come to the table he said according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. For the first time in five decades we are standing up to the Chinese and other trading partners around the world and all we want is equal access and a level playing field.  The crosscurrents on trade could be tricky and suddenly Mr. Perdues globalist background made him susceptible to attacks from fellow conservatives. In September 2019 Lou Dobbs the powerful pro-Trump TV personality reported that Mr. Perdue and another senator were visiting Beijing where Mr. Dobbs warned they may well be undercutting U.S. and China trade negotiations and progress made by the president. Mr. Dobbs noted Mr. Perdues outsourcing record.  A day later Mr. Dobbs issued a correction noting that Mr. Trump had approved the trip.  The China Problem In 2016 Mr. Perdue had preached Republican unity as the divisive Mr. Trump began gaining ground in the G.O.P. primary. But the senator helped spark a civil war among Georgia Republicans in 2020 when he and his Georgia runoff-mate Senator Kelly Loeffler demanded the resignation of the states top elections official a Republican calling the election he oversaw an embarrassment.  More recently the senators supported a failed Texas lawsuit that would have blocked the election result in Georgia where President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. beat Mr. Trump by about 12000 votes and in three other states Mr. Trump lost.  The battle over Mr. Perdues Senate seat has been no less fierce. Mr. Ossoffs crook attack in a televised debate in October was based on disclosures that Mr. Perdue the Senates most prolific stock trader made a number of well-timed trades including in companies that could be affected by his committees votes. An investigation of some of Mr. Perdues stock dealings by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission ended without prosecution and Mr. Perdue has used those facts to argue that he has done nothing wrong.  Mr. Ossoff has revived criticism of Mr. Perdues outsourcing record. And the senator has also had to fend off charges of bigotry for both his mockery of Ms. Harriss name and an online campaign ad that showed a photo of Mr. Ossoff who is Jewish with a lengthened nose. Mr. Perdues campaign has called the image in the ad an accident caused by a filter applied by an outside vendor handling the graphic design.  For his part Mr. Perdues closing attack is in keeping with Republicans emerging argument that Democrats like Mr. Ossoff are too weak and in some cases too compromised to stand up to the threat of Chinese global dominance.  Mr. Ossoff Mr. Perdue contends is a radical left-winger with a grave China problem. He cites as proof a $1000 agreement that allowed a large media company in Hong Kong PCCW to rebroadcast a documentary Mr. Ossoffs company produced about the Islamic State.  Previous reports have characterized one of PCCWs investors China Unicom as a state-owned Chinese company a point Mr. Perdue has used in an effort to tie Mr. Ossoff to the Chinese Communist Party.  For two years he worked with the C.C.P. the senator said in a Fox News interview.  Mr. Perdue has said little about his own China ties.  In 1991 the year before he headed to Hong Kong to build Sara Lees Asian outsourcing operation from the ground up the company proudly announced a new foothold in Asia  a deal in Fuzhou China.  The joint venture Fujian Sara Lee Consumer Products manufactured toothpaste shampoo and other personal care products. It was partially owned by the Chinese government according to a report in The Chicago Tribune announcing the venture.  As the Fujian arrangement continued Mr. Perdue busied himself with building Sara Lees first centralized sourcing operation in Asia including in mainland China he said in a deposition in 2005. That involved lining up suppliers and overseeing quality control and human rights practices for the company which manufactured Hanes clothing among other things.  No American firm could have established such an operation in China at that time without dealing extensively with the government or the Communist Party industry experts said.  You dont just wander into China without central government and local party officials wanting to know what youre doing said Michael Posner a professor at New York Universitys Stern School of Business and a top human rights official during the Obama administration. Its a very controlled environment. And anybody there who is dealing with factories would have had to deal with that. (While some of its products remain on the market Sara Lee has since disbanded.)  This week The Times asked Mr. Perdues campaign if he had any other business involving the Chinese government.  The campaign declined to answer.  Kate Kelly and Jannat Batra contributed reporting.

Do not let the Guard Down or be overconfident!!Trump controls the Narrative in the USA. He can Tweet post on Facebook place Millions of dollars of messages throughout social media and reach close to 160 million people every day and if you add Fox News and as it happened in 2016 Russian promotions in favor of Trump the reach could amount to 200 million. If Trump with over 200000 deaths in the Country and counting millions unemployed thousands of small business in trouble says we are doing a good job even when he failed to provide the proper message and actions knowing how deadly the Virus is and he repeats it almost every day some people will buy into it and believe it...thats the power of Advertising. If Trump even when a number of States have used Mail-in voting for years without any problems other than North Carolina Republican candidate in 2018 and he says mail-in voting will be a fraud and he repeats it almost every day some people will buy-in and believe it. Thats the power of Advertising. If Trump accuses the candidate that beat the socialist candidate with the support of most Elected officials in House Senate and Democratic population of communist as scare tactic and considers himself the Law and Order candidate in the middle of riots violence under his watch because Trump can say anything he wants and he and the Russians can reach 200 million people. No Newspaper or Tv channels together can counter Trumps messages with Facts and Truth and reach 200 Million people every day.

Takeaways from todays Trump visa ban: 1. Extended the suspension on the issuance of immigrant visas in most family and employment based categories to December 31 2020. There are exceptions for spouses and children of US citizens and exceptions for children of residents about to age out. 2. A new ban on the issuance of most H-1B visas (speciality workers) H-2B (non-agricultural temporary/seasonal workers) J-1 (exchange visitors) L (intracompany transferees) and their spouses/children. 3. There is a national interest waiver that can be pursued. 4. This is about VISAS and does not impact anyone in the USA already changing or extending status or seeking lawful permanent residency. But it majorly impacts many people outside waiting to come in through a legal process who arent already in possession of a valid visa or travel document. 5. Many immigration advocacy groups will be suing the Administration again in federal court very soon to put a stop to this nonsense. 6.

Dear Senator Joe Manchin III   I recently had a heart-breaking conversation with my father that has caused me to reach out to you. Hes been practicing as an emergency medical physician for more than forty years an impressive feat for a Black man raised in the era of Jim Crow. The recent renewed efforts to silence Black Americans caused him to reach this conclusion:  Son it looks like Jim Crow is coming back and well have to find a way to live with it.  The resignation in his voice revealed a deep sense of dismay for his country and fear for his grandchildrens future. The last time I heard him speak with such unbearable sadness was at my mothers funeral in 1998. He is a moderate democrat much like yourself and while his experience of America differs greatly from your own he would agree with your words below:  The right to vote is fundamental to our American democracy and protecting that right should not be about party or politics.  In this regard you and I have a common understanding: every American has a constitutional right to participate in this democracy. However determining the necessary actions of protecting these rights is where we differ. While one might feel that a bipartisan compromise is the only way to preserve our nation one cannot bargain with politicians who actively work to suppress the historically disenfranchised to protect the Republican influence of their respective states.  In late May you said that you needed ten good people (Republicans) for you to vote in favor of the For the People Voting Rights Act. Though you were not specific one could assume that you were referring to those who voted for President Trumps impeachment.  Rep. Peter Meijer R-Mich.; Rep. David Valadao R-Calif.; Rep. Dan Newhouse R-Wash.; Rep. John Katko R-N.Y.; Rep. Adam Kinzinger R-Ill.; Rep. Jamie Herrera Beutler R-Wash.;Rep. Tom Rice R-S.C.; Fred Upton R-Mich.; Rep. Anthony Gonzalez R-Ohio; Liz Cheney R-Wyo.  While it certainly took courage to vote against their party leader I cannot share in your optimism. Throughout the United States most notably in the southern states voter suppression laws are being passed and considered by Republican legislature determined to silence non-white and impoverished voices. In particular Michigan Wyoming and Ohio - the resident states of three aforementioned good people - are all considering further ways to restrict access to registration and polling places. Even the recently censured Representative Liz Cheney has demonstrated support for some of these restrictive practices.  Whats further troubling is the lacking specificity in your critique of the For the People Voting Rights Act. Although you oppose the partisan appearance of the act you do not cite anything that is wrong with the bill itself. After reviewing your website and media appearances I could not find a critique of the elements in the bill.  The For the People Voting Rights Act would modernize voter registration increase secure access to the ballot box ensure flexibility for those who must vote early or absentee and increase the participation of Americans in our democracy. However rather than point out flaws or debate the nature of these elements your main point of contention is that not enough Republicans agree. I am left to assume that you know the bill is the right thing for the country but will only support it if there is bipartisan support.  I point to your vote in favor of the January 6th Commission. Despite not having ten brave Republicans you voted in favor of the commission and made the following statement:  Choosing to put politics and political elections above the health of our Democracy is unconscionable. And the betrayal of the oath we each take is something they will have to live with.  These should be the words of a man who does what is right even when he does not have the support from his peers.  Senator Manchin America cannot wait for ten good Republicans. Since 2020 legislatures in 47 states have been presented with 361 bills with restrictive voter provisions. Many of the good Republicans youre waiting on have supported these restrictive bills fought the 2020 census or questioned the integrity of the previous election.  Refusing to support this voting rights bill will force many Americans to choose between work and exercising their vote; limit the number of available polling places; deny funding to upgrade electoral commissions and systems; and further the silence of poor and minority Americans  These actions to target and silence non-white Americans are not unfamiliar nor are the legislative tools used. While you believe the filibuster is integral for compromise it has long been wielded as a whip to silence Black representation. John C. Calhoun used the filibuster so effectively to protect slavery that his bigoted predecessors did not hesitate to use it against the Dyer Anti-lynching BIll (1922); the Civil Rights Act of 1957; and again in 1964.  To put it concisely Senator one cannot compromise with a party that believes in the lie of a stolen election. One should not compromise for the sake of appearing bipartisan for that would be sacrificing the voting rights of Americans to placate a false concern of election integrity. That is not compromise that is appeasement for the only beneficiaries in this illusion of compromise are Republicans seeking the favor of a shadow president and not the American people.

Debt Forgiveness is a Christian Value  I am a bankruptcy attorney and see it pretty much every week: Client consider filing for bankruptcy they know it would help them it is the best option but they feel bad about it procrastinate and delay. When considering bankruptcy it is correct there is an obligation to creditors to repay the debt but even more importantly there is also an obligation to yourself and your family.  Family and you must be have a safe financial basis. Whom does it help if one continues to pay creditors live from pay check to pay check and then does not have the money to pay for the car repair or other emergencies that might come up? People often put the interest of creditors above their own.  Sometimes I tell clients about Donald Trump who filed bankruptcy four times. He is rich because he makes good financial decisions. If there is not enough money to pay off the debt within a reasonable time bankruptcy is a valid option and often the only option to get a fresh start.  Making the minimum payment on a $5000 credit card balance will take over 12 years. Most of the payments will go to interest. During that time more credit might be needed the balance possibly goes up instead of down a cycle that is difficult to stop.  It is vital to get people out of the debt circle: Getting more pay day loans to pay other loans off. Getting a second mortgage to pay off credit cards. Taking out money from retirement and so on. It is not only important to the individual to her health and well being but also important to the society.  If too many people are in debt and depend on the mercy of creditors it is not good for the society. A healthy society lives form a stable middle class. This has always been like this even 2000 years ago to Roman times.  It was so important to the society that it was written in the Bible. In Deuteronomy 15 it says: At the end of every seven years you must cancel debts. 2 This is how it is to be done: Every creditor shall cancel any loan they have made...  It has always been important to the society that people get a break and deserve a fresh start. This is a Christian value. The Lord wants people to be free debt free at least every 7 years. There is no reason to feel bad or being ashamed about filing for bankruptcy. It's is not an option it is a right.  If you are thinking about filing and have been wondering how it works we offer a free no obligation consultation in which the attorney answers all questions and explains the process.

Class is in session. Stand. Pledge. Sit.  Attention Trump Save America Pac donors/would be donors: Trump has not spent even a dime on ANY ballot reviews Donald Trump has been promoting.  FACT Out of the $75 Million in donations the former President has ranked in in 2021 alone donations have thus far gone to Trumps travel Trumps legal fees and Trump's staff. Much of the donations are being held in cash. Currently the Arizona recount via Cyber Ninjas is being paid for via private donations which are not being disclosed.  So when you see a post from Trump or Trumps Save America Pac that say We need you to join the fight to SECURE OUR ELECTIONS! you are just donating to one of the former Presidents most lucrative funds. NONE of this money is actually going to ANY elections previous or moving forward.  Lets look at some other elections facts because the big lie is kinda getting old now and any 12 year old that can do research for a book report could find this information if they chose to.  FACT Republicans OUTPERFORMED Democrats up and down ballot in the 2020 election.  Republicans gained 13 seats in Congress with zero losses by GOP incumbents. Every House Republican in a tossup race won. A record 35 Republican women won election to Congress. Republicans won 59 of 98 state legislative chambersa net gain of two state houses and 141 seats across the country.  FACT There are even Republicans that won in their own election in 2020 that say the election was rigged. For example in Arizona Paul Gosar and Andy Biggs both objected to the certification of the election for Joe Biden based on fraud DESPITE the fact that they won in their own elections. So if the election was rigged against Donald Trump how would Republicans then win their own seats? Paul Gosar and Andy Biggs are not the only ones. Republicans Lauren Boebert Marjorie Taylor Greene and Andrew Clyde all won in Georgia. I could go on. In other words how could Democrats able to rig the election for Joe Biden to win yet they seemingly were unable to rig down ballot elections? Shouldnt these Republicans ask for a recount of their own wins if voting in these states are in question?  And what about Dominion voting machines?  FACT Dominion software was not used in ONLY states that Trump lost and/or states that Trump has filed lawsuits in. The fact of the matter is that this software was used in TWENTY-FOUR STATES.  FACT Dominion software was used in. ONLY SIX STATES that went BLUE for Biden. These include Nevada Arizona Wisconsin Michigan Pennsylvania and Georgia. The remaining EIGHTEEN was won by Donald Trump.  FACT Donald Trump filed lawsuits in the above six states but DID NOT in the ladder eighteen.  So WHY would Dominion software be hacked in some way in just six states when these machines could have all been hacked to vote for Biden? Why JUST these six? And WHY isnt Trump filing lawsuits in ALL 24 STATES? In theory wouldnt you want to file lawsuits in every state that used Dominion as to find out what it was about just these six states machines?  And for that matter how do we know that if fraud occurred some of the dominion software in states that went red could have in the same way have been hacked to go red when they REALLY went blue?  Just totally stupid right?  So lets discuss whats really going on here with this election and just MOVE ON because this debate got stale months ago. Donald Trump lost this election for TWO main reasons.  1. Trump lost voters. These voters either switched to Biden or they did not vote for President and voted for Republicans down ballot. Here is the specific breakdown of 2020 voters per Pew:  *Biden made gains with suburban voters. In 2020 Biden improved upon Clintons vote share with suburban voters: 45% supported Clinton in 2016 vs. 54% for Biden in 2020. This shift was also seen among White voters: Trump narrowly won White suburban voters by 4 points in 2020 (51%-47%); he carried this group by 16 points in 2016 (54%-38%). At the same time Trump grew his vote share among rural voters. In 2016 Trump won 59% of rural voters a number that rose to 65% in 2020.  *Trump made gains among Hispanic voters. Even as Biden held on to a majority of Hispanic voters in 2020 Trump made gains among this group overall. There was a wide educational divide among Hispanic voters: Trump did substantially better with those without a college degree than college-educated Hispanic voters (41% vs. 30%).  *Apart from the small shift among Hispanic voters Joe Bidens electoral coalition looked much like Hillary Clintons with Black Hispanic and Asian voters and those of other races casting about four-in-ten of his votes. Black voters remained overwhelmingly loyal to the Democratic Party voting 92%-8% for Biden. Biden made gains with men while Trump improved among women narrowing the gender gap. The gender gap in the 2020 election was narrower than it had been in 2016 both because of gains that Biden made among men and because of gains Trump made among women. In 2020 men were almost evenly divided between Trump and Biden unlike in 2016 when Trump won men by 11 points. Trump won a slightly larger share of womens votes in 2020 than in 2016 (44% vs. 39%) while Bidens share among women was nearly identical to Clintons (55% vs. 54%).  *Biden improved over Clinton among White non-college voters. White voters without a college degree were critical to Trumps victory in 2016 when he won the group by 64% to 28%. In 2018 Democrats were able to gain some ground with these voters earning 36% of the White non-college vote to Republicans 61%. In 2020 Biden roughly maintained Democrats 2018 share among the group improving upon Clintons 2016 performance by receiving the votes of 33%. But Trumps share of the vote among this group  who represented 42% of the total electorate this year  was nearly identical to his vote share in 2016 (65%). Biden grew his support with some religious groups while Trump held his ground. Both Trump and Biden held onto or gained with large groups within their respective religious coalitions. Trumps strong support among White evangelical Protestants ticked up (77% in 2016 84% in 2020) while Biden got more support among atheists and agnostics than did Clinton in 2016.  *After decades of constituting the majority of voters Baby Boomers and members of the Silent Generation made up less than half of the electorate in 2020 (44%) falling below the 52% they constituted in both 2016 and 2018. Gen Z and Millennial voters favored Biden over Trump by margins of about 20 points while Gen Xers and Boomers were more evenly split in their preferences. Gen Z voters those ages 23 and younger constituted 8% of the electorate while Millennials and Gen Xers made up 47% of 2020 voters.  *A record number of voters reported casting ballots by mail in 2020  including many voters who said it was their first time doing so. Nearly half of 2020 voters (46%) said they had voted by mail or absentee and among that group about four-in-ten said it was their first time casting a ballot this way. Hispanic and White voters were more likely than Black voters to have cast absentee or mail ballots while Black voters were more likely than White or Hispanic voters to have voted early in person. Urban and suburban voters were also more likely than rural voters to have voted absentee or by mail ballot.  2. Republicans opted to not vote because they were told that the election was rigged and that their vote would not count. Donald Trump told his Republican voters for months and months prior to the election that the election would be rigged if he did not win. This is because he had internal polling that showed he was losing the election due to his handling of COVID19. As such Republicans simply did NOT make use of early voting they instead voted on election day. Conversely Democrats overwhelmingly opted to vote by mail.  And here is one last piece of data that might clear up any remaining doubt. Donald Trump did not win in 2016 by the millions and millions of voters that he says he did folks.  FACT Trumps victory was so small in fact that he actually won in 2016 because of 77000 votes in three states Michigan Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Almost three million MORE voters voted for Hillary Clinton. To put this into perspective you could fit all of the people that Trump won the election with into ONE SINGLE SMALL FOOTBALL STADIUM.  Trump isnt spending his money on election fraud claims because he knows there was no election fraud folks.  Extra Credit  Trump has been known to trick people into donating more then they had intended. Although its difficult to pinpoint an exact number of how many people were duped there is a figure that suggests lots of people ended up donating more money than they intended. Trumps campaign refunded 10.7 percent of the money raised on the Republican Partys fundraising platform WinRed. That amounted to around $122 million in online donations in 2020 ALONE.  Trump's own disclaimer notes that Trump may shift campaign-donor money into his private buisnesses.  Thats all.,political,Facebook
MURDER FAR WORSE FOR BLACKS UNDER OBAMA  History has it that the disproportionate victimization killing of blacks still stands at its highest point under Obamas leadership as the President of America.  Under Obama White Americans enjoyed the benefits of improved public safety much more than blacks. In 2015 alone there was an overall 13 percent uptick in the murder tally compared to 2014 all of it concentrated in cities and neighborhoods where large number of Black people live. Murder rose by more than 50 percent in Washington D.C and by 63 percent in Baltimore which alone account for about 15 percent of the national increase.  Black victims accounted for nearly two-thirds of the year-over-year increase which translates to 944 additional Black people murder out of just under 1500 additional victims nationwide. More than half of this increase (about 811 additional murders) came just from blacks aged 17 to 39.  The number of Hispanic murder victims ticked up by 8 percent about the same as the increase in White victims.  Because of the terrible condition of Blacks and after being failed by Democratic policies they believed strongly that they have nothing to lose by turning to Donald Trump a man with genuine commitment on well-being of every American. Also renowned for the slogan America first!  Studies show that Donald Trump has a strong point about law and order and this in perspective explains why Black communities victimization and murder dramatically reduced over the years in comparison to the Obama era when victimization and indiscriminate murder of African Americans was at an alarming rate.  It goes without saying that African Americans are safer under Trumps presidency. The executive order recently signed by President Trump to check police brutality is testament to this. Trump has also created more jobs in history for African Americans bringing the unemployment rate among Blacks to an unprecedented low.  Obamas failures are glaring. His dismal record in addressing the black victimization issue bear credence to his shambolic presidency. He not only failed Americans as a President but also failed the African American community who had high expectations of him when he assumed office.  Obama is a colossal failure even to the African continent where his biological parents are believed to have come from. Till date Malik Obama his elder brother is rumoured to have described Barack as a disgrace to the African continent. This opinion is also shared by a number of analysts who perceive Obamas hypocritical adventure and needless war in Libya as tragic flaw of Africas economic development. These critics also consider Obama as foolish for choosing to pursue a policy in Africa of coercing African leaders to accept homosexual marriage as against a much more productive policy of seeking to eradicate poverty from the continent.

"John Durham I understand that the scope of your investigation has become much ""broader"".. However after such a long time if you already know of wrongdoing and fraud and corruption you should step forward and announce so. Maybe for the sake of the country and the people and for the sake of justice you should publish your investigation in two or more phases. To just take year after year in further probes is just not right. If you already know of foul play you must announce it ! Hillary Clinton created the Russian collusion hoax to take attention away from her cheating and stealing and being bribed in favor of her foundation for tens of millions of dollars. The monies paid were not for brilliant Bill Clinton speeches we all know that. She created this hoax to distract from her illegal email fiasco and emails that most probably proved she was being bribed and was selling favors for money to her and Bill.The bribes were indirectly going to the Clintons through direct contributions to ""The Clinton Foundation"".  It is quite comfortable and easy to extort other countries for money when you are The Secretary of State of The United States of America and you are willing to sell your country and people for personal gain and power. Biden did it as VP too !  Durham Mueller knew very early on in his investigation of ""Trump Russian Collusion"" that The President was innocent but dragged it on for years to beat Trump down with a circus of democrats and the MSM cheering him on. I feel with you the opposite is true. You know of extreme wrongdoing but you are holding back in laying the truth out. If there is no wrongdoing say so if that is the case. That is fine too whatever the truth is. Your reasoning that it has to be ""complete and comprehensive and it is broader"" just do not make any sense.

It began with soliciting aid from a foreign country in the 2016 election Russia if you are listening. continued in repeated violations of the U.S. Constitutions emoluments clause foreign visitors at Trumps DC hotel Secret Service agents staying a Mar-a-Lago at inflated charges at his Scottish Golf Course Turnberry and at another in Ireland. Most recently in using the White House as a campaign backdrop in clear violation of the Hatch Act.  Speaking of lawlessness how many Trump officials or supporters have been indicted convicted etc. Paul Manafort Gen. Michael Flynn Rep. Chris Collins R-NY Duncan Hunter R-CA convicted pedophile George Nader donors Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman and of course Michael Cohen and his un-indicted co-conspirator Donald Trump. You get the picture!  Speaking of such diseases as Trump and his Administration lets examine Covid-19. (He confused it through his Covfefe 17 dementia.) Rather than listen to medical experts he listened to Shawn Hannity seriously Shawn Hannity. Hannity called it a Democratic hoax so being servile to Fox News on February 26 2020 Trump claimed 'that we had maybe 15 cases in the country and that they would all be gone soon.' News Flash! Not gone still here with thousands needlessly dead dead and gone gone forever.  Trump did not lead he followed he followed Hannity. He did not invoke the Defense Production Act to provide ventilators or personal protection he simply claimed that he was not responsible and foisted the virus upon the nations governors. It is what it is!  This is not what real leaders do real leaders step up to the plate they grab a bat they take a firm stance and they take a swing at whatever threatens the nation and the citizens they take an oath to protect. Trump merely bunted because it is all that he was willing or capable of doing. Mighty Casey might have stuck out swinging at Covid 19 but Trump cowardly tried a squeeze play and failed to advance the nations response to the virus. Death death death and massive unemployment and hardship this is the legacy of Trump!  Here we could detail the many additional failings of Trumps Presidency more foul smelling episodes from the Twilight Zone:   Coddling dictators Putin and Kim  Abandoning and demeaning our Allies  Undermining environmental protections  Withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accords  Withdrawing from the Iran Nuclear Agreement  Suppressing voting rights & Undermining Vote by Mail  Refusing to respond to lawful subpoenas for witnesses and tax returns  Kids in Cages  Showing no empathy for black lives  Coddling and encouraging white supremacists  On and  On and  On!  But now we learn consistent with his personality his narcissism his demeaning of John McCain and from multiple sources that our war dead and wounded are Loser and Suckers!  We think not you vile cretin you Agent Orange stain upon the tenants of American democracy.  We are empowered by our vote to reclaim Lincolns better Angels of our Nature; we will not suffer another moment more than necessary at your little hands at your little mind nor through your deaf dumb and blind supporters!  Rather Joe Biden the Joe We Know will fill the void of the past four years with experience intelligence empathy compassion equally capable administrators (not self-serving criminals) and take a swing at all that ails the nation yes including rioters and looters as set forth in his platform.,political,Facebook

A Liberal Explains the Cause of High Gas Prices Forget the fact that Joe Biden killed the Keystone Pipeline deal and cost the U.S. thousands of jobs and forget that he put a moratorium on all new oil and gas leases on federal land and offshore waters. Dont think about how he is suffocating domestic oil production with mandates such as establishing comprehensive standards of performance and emission guidelines from existing oil and gas operations by September 2021 and ordering Texas to submit State Implementation Plan for Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) by January 2022. Of course these policies will make us no longer energy independent and U.S. oil imports are expected to rise 2 million barrels per day by 2030 and U.S. gross domestic product will be declining $700 billion during the same span but that is not why gas prices are rising. Neither is fact that U.S. oil production is expected to decline 230000 barrels a day in 2021. Right-wing nut job conspiracy theorists and QAnon will tell you that is reason gas prices are going up. Those people are spreading disinformation! They might even try to tell you how Joe Biden waived sanctions on Russias pipeline while at the same time pulling the plug on our own Keystone pipeline which infuriated one of our strongest allies in Canada. While he did give our Russian enemy the same thing he took away from our neighboring Canadian allies that is not why gas prices are high. And dont think about how he hamstrung domestic oil production then recently turned around and asked OPEC to produce more oil instead of figuring out a way for the U.S. to produce more oil even though he ran on an America first platform. His inconsistent messaging and terrible policies have nothing to do with the high price of gas. That is nothing more than a right-wing conspiracy being spread by unsophisticated xenophobic white supremacists. These people probably want you to think about his rhetoric during the 2020 campaign when he called Saudi Arabia a pariah state with no redeeming social value only to see Saudi Arabia retaliate immediately after Joe Biden took office by committing to unilaterally cut 1 million barrels of oil. People spreading disinformation want you to believe that they did this to pressure Joe Biden into not penalizing Saudi Arabias crown prince Mohammed bin Salam for directly approving the killing of Jamal Khashoggi the Washington Post columnist who was drugged and dismembered in 2018. They probably also want you to believe it worked too and how Joe Biden did nothing to hold Mohammed bin Salam accountable for fear of upsetting U.S. Arabian allies. Some people might even argue that he failed on the humanitarian front by not seeking justice for the killing of an American citizen and he also failed on an economic front as well by allowing himself to be bullied by the Saudis. Even though this is a blatant lie let's just say he did fail on multiple fronts by not taking a clear position on that foreign policy decision. So what? That is not the reason gas prices are going up. In fact none of Joe Bidens terrible policies or bad decisions have anything to do with the price of gas today. Any expert will tell you that it is physically impossible for Joe Biden to cause a rise in the price of gas. Follow the science. All the data suggests that a man who wears aviator shades and eats ice cream could never screw anything up so bad that gas prices could rise 50% in just 8 months. It is metaphysically impossible. Blaming Joe Biden for the rise in gas prices is nothing more than a wild conspiracy theory. The real reason that gas prices are so high today are because of one man and one man alone. DONALD J.

"This woman Michelle Obama is either really in denial or a poor malicious propaganda artist. She is the one who said ""when they go low we go high"". Nothing could hav been more false. Basically the left say things that sound great but intend the exact opposite and do the opposite. Now she comes out and says that the protests were almost entirely peaceful and Trump is making it up that they are violent to create racial division. Again this is Goebbels speech because she and her husband are doing everything to stir racial divisions and chaos and accusing the other side of that which they are guilty of.The most corrupt first lady with the most corrupt President in history the Obamas are at it again.

It IS possible to be a faithful Latter-day Saint and still vote FOR Joe Biden not just against Donald Trump. Joe is a deeply religious man committed to decency and respect and is running as he says to restore the soul of our nation. I have known him for many years and I believe he's the best equipped to do just that. He has the empathy necessary to help our country heal after an unrelenting stream of national crises. He has the humility to rely on experts. You can rest assured that when you vote for Joe you vote for a good man who will do his best to serve the American peoplesomething I don't think anyone can say about his opponent.

"Following is a first-hand account of what preceded Trump's photo op at St. Johns Church Washington D.C. on June 1 2020.  It is not hyperbolic to say that 1st Amendment rights were violated on his orders:  This is from GREG GONSALVES to The Reverend GINA GERBASI:  He was on the church grounds handing out water help medics. THIS IS WHAT TRUMP ORDERED TO BE DONE TO PEACEFUL PROTESTORS. Clergy medics & volunteers on the church patio. They were driven off church property without warning & were also gassed. No one bothered to ask permission to use the church.  @GiniGerbasi a priest at St John's Episcopal Church Georgetown Washington DC: Friends I am ok but I am frankly shaken. I was at St. John's Lafayette Square most of the afternoon with fellow clergy and laypeople -- and clergy from some other denominations too."" 1/  .""We were passing out water and snacks and helping the patio area at St. John's Lafayette Square to be a place of respite and peace.

Those people were AMAZING. They had been on the patio all day and thankfully had not had to use much of the eyewash they had made."" 3/  ""Around 6:15 or 6:30 the police started really pushing protestors off of H Street (the street between the church and Lafayette Park) and ultimately the White House.

I was coughing her eyes were watering and we were trying to help people as the police -- in full riot gear -- drove people toward us."" 5/  ""Julia and her classmates left and I stayed with the BLM folks trying to help people.

The Senate just confirmed the 200th Federal Judge nominated by President Trump.  FACTS:  1) These Judges were appointed at a faster pace than any other president in history except for President Carter  2) There is no judicial vacancy in the Circuit Court in the country for the first time in at least 40 years  3) These Trump Judges now make up more than one quarter of the federal judiciary  4) These Trump Judges will hold their office for their lifetime.  POINTS:  1) This accomplishment should be celebrated by every American for the simple reason that a federal judiciary running at capacity alleviates case backlog and delay of justice that the people suffer as a result of vacancies.  2) Long after President Trump leaves office these Judges will continue shaping American law. For this reason voters must view Presidential candidates in a broader light than just one name one personality one office. The President you vote for holds office for 4-8 years.

As in Waco Tribune-Herald on 10 Oct 2020...  LISTEN TO THE WOMEN  by Gallagher & Schleicher  Six months ago we took a self-imposed sabbatical from the editorial pages of the Waco Tribune-Herald having no idea just how much weirder things could get in these somewhat United States.  Back then the novel coronavirus had taken only some 100000 American lives we were blissfully unaware of the Proud Boys and one might still imagine that surely there was some year when the president-to-be actually paid his fair share of personal income taxes into the system he longed to manage. And it was not yet known how deeply the presidents callousness might run when it came to the safety of everyone from those in the armed forces to his personal White House staff to the governor of Michigan.  The events during our six-month absence best are described as worst case scenario. Even Nostradamus could not have predicted a Rose Garden event to push through a post-election-start Supreme Court nominee that would turn into a super-spreader event. Our hope that we might return to the Trib to find less divisive times turned out to be no more realistic than expecting the coronavirus to magically disappear as if by a miracle. (Though perhaps our goal of not costing the Trib any additional subscribers or advertisers was fulfilled as the peculiar level of animosity our columns often generated subsided.)  The one positive thing we can say about this election is how much it does to the old adage that all the candidates are the same and voting makes no real difference. No modern president has ever been so universally embraced by white supremacists or been so timid in his willingness to condemn them. Democratic Joe Biden by contrast accepts the word of the FBI director and other national security officials that our greatest terrorism danger comes from these homegrown extremists  the ones urged by Trump to stand back and stand by the ones urged by Trump to Liberate Michigan.  The Trump-centered chaos of the last four years turns out not to be an accident. If one is an authoritarian narcissist being the star and potential savior of each days new crisis is a plus. During the primaries wed worried Biden was a bit dull and too moderate compared to some of the other candidates. But the publics exhaustion with Trump as well as Trumps inability to successfully tag Biden as a far-left hazard to liberty now persuade us that Joe may be just what is needed to give critical swing-state voters an alternative theyll accept.  We observe a number of younger white liberal males who still ponder whether to vote Green Party or sit this election out. They worry Biden is not liberal enough that crooks on Wall Street will never be called to account and that the most needy will remain the least protected. We ask them to be true to their progressive roots by joining us in listening to the women in their lives. By not assuming that their own ability to survive four more years of Trump makes it worthwhile to recklessly gamble his re-election might somehow cause a true liberal to be elected in 2024 to clean up the mess.  A recent Fox News poll showed Biden to be leading Trump nationally by 10 points but the gender gap in women versus men supporting Biden to be +19 points. Whether in other national polls or ones from battleground states the trend is a strongly consistent one.  Does Trump tend to remind women of that guy at work who wont let them speak in meetings? Of an abusive ex-husband? Of the arrogant boss who is never slowed by his ignorance? Of the frat boy in college who didnt believe that no meant no? All of the above?  Instead we surmise they simply see more clearly than the men in their lives how the safety and economic health of them and their families is too precarious to await a more perfect candidate while others use this election as an excuse to take part in testosterone-poisoned displays of AK-47s and Trump flags.  The overwhelming rejection of Trump/Pence by many women is no surprise in a state like Texas that has produced some of the sharpest minds and clearest hearts in public service. Ann Richards Barbara Jordan Molly Ivins Barbara Bush  the list goes on but all reflect the unflinching wisdom and wit of the Texas woman.  Women in Texas and elsewhere are able to see and accept what many men simply cannot: the fundamental importance of integrity empathy and humanity in those chosen to lead our country. We are in awe of those women who speak courageously and earnestly in their support for Biden/Harris or their opposition to Trump/Pence often putting them at odds with others at the office in church or on social media. We admire the determination of many others quietly planning to vote their own conscience and allowing a spouse or brother to make mistaken assumptions about what that decision might be.  For voters still on the fence know that in this election a vote for anyone other than Biden/Harris is a vote for Trump. Trump openly admits he doesnt necessarily plan to leave office even come 2024. By then he will have so packed the courts that even a President AOC could make no meaningful headway on issues such as climate change or universal health care. Male voters considering holding out for something better four years from now will do best to set aside their privilege and listen to those who will suffer most and be protected least if we continue down the present road.

This is why I am running for US Congress:  Back in 2004 one of my neighbors asked if I could help to save the Shawnee Indian Mission. One catch - the meeting was about to start  regardless of the short notice I knew I needed to help. So wearing sweatpants my hair pulled back and my youngest son on my hip I attended the meeting. When the suggestion came up that we start a petition I took the microphone and outlined a plan on how we could save the Mission. We were successful and the Shawnee Indian Mission is still funded to this day and open to the public.  That is when I knew my passion for helping people was a calling for public service. After serving on the City Council I ran for and was elected the first Hispanic Female Mayor of Roeland Park in 2009.  These were tough times for Kansans  we were in a recession. But we made it through removing government created barriers to help create more jobs in the private sector.  Tough times calls for strong unwavering leadership. Leadership that puts the needs of YOU above the desire to grow government.  In 2018 I was appointed by the Trump Administration to serve as Region 7 Advocate to the Small Business Administration. I was serving in the Trump Administration when Sharice Davids was elected and Nancy Pelosi became speaker. While I was working with small businesses to put an end to burdensome regulations put into place under Obama socialism was taking over the US House.  I worked hand-in-hand with business owners and the Trump Administration to put an end to many of these regulations that were holding businesses back  one of which was ending Waters of the US.  As we were working on the United States  Mexico  Canada Agreement (USMCA) I was watched in disbelief as the socialist agenda of Speaker Pelosi and Sharice Davids kept holding this historic trade agreement hostage.  That is when I knew something needed to be done. After discussing it with my husband Stephen and much needed prayer  I announced my Candidacy for U.S. Congress.  Kansans deserves better than a pawn of Nancy Pelosi and the socialist agenda of the far left  but our current Congresswoman Sharice Davids is hell bent on pushing the socialist agenda of the far left.  Watching the socialist agenda of Pelosi and her pawn Sharice Davids holding the USMCA hostage  putting socialism above freedom  was just like that knock on my door back in 2004.  I am running for Congress because we do not need socialism  we need freedom and I will lead the fight in Congress to Keep America Great.,political,Facebook

"WHEN THE MESSAGE IS BAD... SUE THE MESSENGER! WELCOME TO THE NEWEST BANANA REPUBLIC SANS BANANAS!  Trump campaign demands CNN apologize for poll that shows Biden leading.  By Veronica Stracqualursi and Harry Enten CNN  Updated 3:54 PM EDT Wed June 10 2020  Washington(CNN)President Donald Trump's campaign is demanding CNN retract and apologize for a recent poll that showed him well behind presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.  The demand coming in the form of a cease and desist letter to CNN President Jeff Zucker that contained numerous incorrect and misleading claims was immediately rejected by the network.  ""We stand by our poll"" said Matt Dornic a CNN spokesman.  Biden builds largest lead this year  The CNN poll conducted by SSRS and released on Monday shows Trump trailing the former vice president by 14 points 55%-41% among registered voters. It also finds the President's approval rating at 38% -- his worst mark since January 2019 and roughly on par with approval ratings for one-term Presidents Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush at this point in their reelection years -- and his disapproval rating at 57%.  In the letter to Zucker the Trump campaign argued that the CNN poll is ""designed to mislead American voters through a biased questionnaire and skewed sampling.""  ""It's a stunt and a phony poll to cause voter suppression stifle momentum and enthusiasm for the President and present a false view generally of the actual support across America for the President"" read the letter signed by the Trump campaign's senior legal adviser Jenna Ellis and chief operating officer Michael Glassner.  View Trump and Biden head-to-head polling The campaign formally requested that CNN retract the poll and publish a ""full fair and conspicuous retraction apology and clarification to correct its misleading conclusions.""  David Vigilante CNN's executive vice president and general counsel told the campaign that its ""allegations and demands are rejected in their entirety.""  ""To my knowledge this is the first time in its 40-year history that CNN had been threatened with legal action because an American politician or campaign did not like CNN's polling results"" Vigilante wrote in his response.  ""To the extent we have received legal threats from political leaders in the past they have typically come from countries like Venezuela or other regimes where there is little or no respect for a free and independent media.""  After CNN released the poll earlier this week Trump tweeted that he had hired Republican pollster McLaughlin & Associates to ""analyze"" the survey and others ""which I felt were FAKE based on the incredible enthusiasm we are receiving."" McLaughlin ranks as one of the least accurate pollsters in the industry as measured by FiveThirtyEight.  But several other polls released over the past few weeks -- including polls by ABC News/Washington Post Monmouth University NPR/PBS Newshour/Marist College NBC News/Wall Street Journal Quinnipiac University and Fox News -- also show Biden well ahead of Trump. These polls averaged with the CNN poll find Biden up by double digits a result well outside any margin of error.  Misleading claims  The campaign's letter which heavily cites findings by McLaughlin makes several incorrect and misleading claims.  ""It's a poll of 1259 adults -- not even registered voters let alone likely voters"" the letter says citing a McLaughlin memo from earlier this week.  While it's accurate that 1259 adults were reached on landlines or cell phones by a live interviewer for the survey the 14-point margin by which Trump is trailing Biden came from a question posed only to 1125 registered voters. It's typical for polling to sample registered voters rather than likely ones at this stage of the race as it's difficult to project whether voters will participate in an election that is five months away. CNN as do most public pollsters typically reports results from likely voters around Labor Day.  It should be noted that in CNN's poll Biden expands his lead among those who are most (i.e. extremely) enthusiastic to vote.  Joe Biden hits a milestone Hillary Clinton never did: 50%  McLaughlin says CNN's survey is a ""skewed anti-Trump poll of only 25% Republican."" That percentage of respondents however is consistent with several other major polls that use live telephone interviews which provide the most reliable snapshot of the race. McLaughlin this week argued that pollsters should include a third of Republicans in surveys to reflect the 33% that they represented in the 2016 vote but exit polls nearly always have higher shares of partisans and lower shares of independents than pre-election phone polls.  Among the entire sample 32% identified themselves in CNN's poll as Democrats 25% identified themselves as Republicans and 44% described themselves as independents or belonging to another party. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points. It is 3.6 points among registered voters.  The letter to Zucker also includes McLaughlin's criticism that the poll conducted between June 2 and 5 was taken ""before the great economic news"" an improvement in the jobless rate that was released on Friday even though the poll was still being conducted throughout that day. And the survey comes amid an especially turbulent time in Trump's presidency including the ongoing coronavirus pandemic outrage and concern over race relations in the wake of George Floyd's killing at the hands of police officers and the US officially entering a recession.  Visit CNN's Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race  McLaughlin has also argued that the poll unfairly includes ""questions on issues including race relations not job creation which could have biased the poll further"" though CNN's survey does ask registered voters who would better handle the economy (Trump leads 51% to Biden's 46%) and was conducted at the height of the Floyd protests.  Trump has regularly chafed at polls that do not reflect favorably on him while promoting ones that do. Last month Trump bashed Fox News a network he often touts and gives interviews to for a telephone-conducted poll that showed him behind Biden by 8 points and instead pointed to a CNN poll released earlier in the month where he was leading Biden in battleground states. That CNN poll however showed Biden had a 5-point lead over Trump among registered voters nationwide.  ""Why doesn't @FoxNews put up the CNBC POLL or the (believe it or not!) @CNN Poll? Hope Roger A is looking down and watching what has happened to this once beautiful creation!"" Trump tweeted at the time referring to the late Fox News founder Roger Ailes. Trump has also credited CNN's polling when it has suited him as he did in December 2015 when he thanked several on-air reporters for their ""very professional reporting of the new CNN Poll"" that showed him ahead in the Iowa caucuses.

What I couldnt say at the time and thought better to not agitate him was this:  Given the evidence that the ENTIRE PLANET was infected with this virus and that nearly every developed nation that used reasonable measures in prevention by following the advice of professionals in the field have lower infection rates per capita and lower overall fatality rates. Despite having a first world medical industry and top rated immunology research facilities I have to sternly object to the idea that Trump was just doing the Best that he can and implying that this would have happened regardless of who was in office.  First his ban on China was at best an amateurish attempt to prevent the virus from coming into the country not thinking about the 40000 people that were in China and that are residents of the United States would immediately come home to all points of the country in a panic. Plus his attempt to ban travel from Europe but NOT the UK. That managed to allow the virus to seep in from the Atlantic side.  Next no national testing contact tracing quarantine or masking protocol was put in place though these protocols were left in a pandemic playbook for future administrations by the Obama Administration. Trump arrogantly decided that he knew better than Obama on these matters despite Obamas record of response that was clearly superior to Trumps in nearly every way with the three epidemics during his eight years in office.  Finally Trump falsely claimed that the National stockpile was bare that there was no Playbook that it would just Go Away and that No One Could Have Known but these claims have been fact checked by multiple sources and found to be False Mostly False or Pants On Fire. Additionally Bob Woodward Pulitzer prize winning journalist has it on tape proving that he lied to the country about knowing how severe the virus is how lethal it is how communicable it is and how it is transmitted from one person to another. He literally knew all of these factors and delayed the national public response by Playing it Down in deference to our economy in a narcissistic endeavor to assure his reelection.  So what has Trump done exactly in terms of the Coronavirus that was so wrong?  Considering that he lies nearly every word that comes out of his mouth he is flagrantly incompetent and reckless with his public speaking when matters of national interest are involved. His obsession with showing the world that he is a better President than his predecessor has demonstrably shown that he is anything but. His complete disregard for Plans and Procedures that have been endorsed by experts in the field in favor of just going By His Gut has turned a small panic into a nationwide catastrophe where the United States having only 4% of the worlds population has 25% of the worlds fatalities directly due to Covid-19. His decision process has shown to be short sighted impulsive and disregarding of scientific reality.  No Trump is not doing the Best That He Can. He isnt even trying.,political,Facebook
"We ask all members of our town of all political persuasions to condemn President Trump for his disparaging comments about the fallen heroes who have sacrificed their lives for our country. To refer to them as ""losers or suckers"" is so outside the realm of reality not to mention decency that it betrays the core principles of our nation. It is critical that we unite in our disgust. Anyone who speaks this way is unfit to serve in any office.",political,Facebook
"Here is todays economic lesson.  Businesses absorb additional costs (such as higher taxes) in 2 ways. 1. Lower costs (usually payroll) or 2. Raise revenue (prices of goods). This also reduces profit margins which slow investment and growth (new jobs).  But how does this hurt the tax payer and not the rich like the democrats keep promising?  Joe Biden says he wants to tax the rich those making over $400000 a year and raise taxes on corporations. Allow me to explain why this will cost you more money than it will cost the corporations and how this is a ploy to get tax payers to pay for more government programs while the democrats can pretend they are not going to tax the people.  (Borrowed example)  Let's say Walmart makes a Billion Dollars a year and Joe decides to take away 10% of that income $100 million. Walmart will pass that cost on to the consumer you and me! However because of the ""New"" tax structure they will need to raise prices about 12% to recover that hundred million Biden took. Not only will you pay higher prices but you will also pay additional sales tax because the retail price is higher. So that 10% old Joe took from the corporations will cost YOU between 12% and 15% depending on where you live. Oh by the way same thing for a $15 minimum wage; business passes those costs on to the consumer as well.  Now you might say well the rich will pay the higher price too and you are right but here is the catch. The average working person spends 98% of his or her income while the wealthy spend roughly 60% of their income.  Taxing corporations shift the tax burden to the middle and lower class but in a sneaky roundabout way. The Liberals know this they are just hoping that you are too uneducated to think for yourself!  In the end the cost of all goods and service will increase and the middle and lower classes will bear the burden!  Don't be fooled by promises of free stuff or more government benefits; there is no such thing as a free lunch. The folks WILL pay for it all in the end. There is no such thing as Government Money the money that the government has was confiscated from We the People!  (End of borrowed example)  There is a reason every American was benefiting from the Trump economy prior to the pandemic. A truly free market without government intervention or taxation grows from the bottom up and benefits the working class more than any other economic strategy.  Get out and vote!",political,Facebook
Did you notice that Donald J. Trump keeps saying that we are rounding the curve with regard to #covid_19? If youre always rounding the curve doesnt that mean youre just going in a circle and not getting anywhere?  Maybe the first true words spoken by POTUS 45,political,Facebook
So practically every expert in the world lists widespread testing as key to control the spread of corona virus. It makes sense if people know they have it they are more likely to take care not to spread it. But because more testing will also increase the reported cases Trump tried to get his team to scale back testing because it was making the U.S. and his leadership look bad ( this is his words at his rally last night). This reinforces Bolton's contention that the only principle that guides Trumps presidency is getting reelected no matter if it is good or bad for our country.,political,Facebook

New Times Call for New Adaptable and Creative Approaches St Pete Mayoral Race Part 2. By: Jean-Marie Leon  The BayNews9 (#likeBN9) mayoral debate afforded #BodyCams4StPetePD an opportunity to learn about the candidates. Once again here we go with the disclaimer: Our movement is independent and seeks to achieve police accountability with adequate public safety. We hold politicians accountable for their record. Because we value good policing and administration we despise those that use their authority or their office to abuse the public trust. Lets get down to brass tacks. The second segment of the debate is of interest to our movement. We quoted or paraphrased relevant responses followed by my analysis.  First question: Do you believe systemic racism is a problem in the St Petersburg Police Department? Why or Why not?  -Rice: Lets define systemic racism by doing so we can see that we dont need to have racists for systemic racism to exist. The remnants of the racist policies of the past are still present in the justice system today. I am not calling anyone a racist but we have to be honest that certain things that we inherited over the decades. That are here because originally it benefited one group of people over another -Boland: Systemic racism exists but its not a pervasive problem in SPPD. We came a long way with Chief Holloway but theres still more work to do. The worst consequences of a systemic racist policy is the war on drug that led to many black and brown citizens being locked up and robbed of a decent future. We have a lot of great police officers and my plan is to ensure they get all the help they need to continue and improve their public safety work and eventually have a police department that is the model for policing. -Ingram: I believe the most important thing for the police department is accountability. Systemic racism exists on all levels of the US. We need to address it before we experience it. The real question is not whether it exists or not but that there is no home at any levels in our city. -Welch: 30 years ago I wrote an article being profiled in Largo and that is still going on today. I attended 6 meetings about the 18 murders that occurred on the South Side. More conversations are needed. -Blackmon: Systemic racism is not an issue in our police department. SPPD is one of the most diverse police departments in the country. He finished by talking about crime issues in the black communities.  Second question: St Pete has recently experienced an alarming number of shooting deaths what do you contribute this violence to? And how would you address it as mayor?  -Rice: The main factor that contributed to the rise of violent deaths in St Pete were related to the health and economic crisis. We need to provide mental health to those in need by removing the stigma associated with Mental Health and as Mayor I will work with our multiple partners that provide mental health services. -Boland: Some of it are the consequences of the lock down the economic despair the achievement gap the literacy rate is lower in South St Pete but there is also financial illiteracy. At the end of the day it all comes down to the failed war on drug. We need to move away from politics as usual and move forward with new ideas. -Welch: We had a private meeting to discuss the issue. Young people were there and they said there is a sense of hopelessness and a lack of foreseeable path to success. -Blackmon: I sponsored a buyback gun program and we need to provide more opportunities for education because thats why these kids are committing those crimes they dont see a future. With that being said Commissioner Welch was in that post for 20 years and the problem got no better under his leadership in South St. Pete -Welchs response: I created an APAD program that prevents people from being arrested for certain minor crimes. Our juvenile diversion program has the highest level of participation and is one of the most successful in the state. (Well get to APAD in my analysis)  Our Analysis. First thing first Michael Ingram the youngest candidate in the field had the best answer when it came to systemic racism. This fact says a lot about our citys future. We are hopeful that the next generation will get it right. Well done Sir Ingram!  Ken Welch: The most important tool needed to improve our collective situation is a system that can document all interactions with Police Officers after you were profiled 30 years ago. The sense of hopelessness that the black youth feel today is a direct product of these programs that seek to keep our citizens in the justice system instead of ensuring adequate safeguards to prevent it instead. The Adult Pre-Arrest Diversion (APAD) and Diversion bring a lot of resentment when you were wrongly arrested and/or treated.  As promised lets address the APAD program that this candidate has been preaching as a success. On the surface APAD prevents you from being arrested and dealing with the stigma that comes with an arrest. In principle that is a good thing but as with everything in the legal system it was not made to benefit the masses. To all the other candidates running to be mayor shame on you for not doing your research. APAD is the biggest opportunity-limiting for adults and best cost reduction program for the justice system at the expense of the citizens.  We are quoting the county website: [The APAD program was developed to decrease the number of people booked into the Pinellas County Jail and prosecuted within the Pinellas County Criminal Court System. It commenced operation on October 17th 2016. Avoiding the costly expense associated with incarceration and court proceedings was a significant factor that motivated local governmental officials to start the Adult Pre-Arrest Diversion Program. Pinellas officials justify the program in part by contending that it will keep people who commit certain offenses from having a criminal record that could interfere with their future employment acceptance into academic institutions and avoid housing or occupational licensing problems. You should not be misled into believing that records of your admission to the crime and participation in the APAD program do not exist and will therefore be unavailable to the public. To the contrary in order to effectively administer the APAD program the Pinellas County Sheriffs Office is required to maintain a database of participants. Without such a database they would for example be unable to determine how many times you have participated in the APAD program or whether your failure to complete the program in the past makes you automatically disqualified to participate in the future. Currently Florida Statutes Section 943.0585 and 943.059 and Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.692 govern the sealing and expungement of criminal records. No provision of law has been enacted to enable the sealing or expungement of records associated with Pinellas Countys APAD Program. Florida Statute Section 119.01(1) provides that It is the policy of this state that all state county and municipal records are open for personal inspection and copying by any person. Thus although your involvement with law enforcement will not be reflected on an FCIC or NCIC rap sheet a public records request made to the police agency who issued you the notice of referral or to the PCSO who administers the APAD program would reveal information about your case.]  Mr. Welch is taking credit for a program that mostly benefits the justice system while limiting the citizens potential. You see once you accept this deal and claim responsibility in return your record is forever available to the public. It cant be sealed or expunged. If you knew this fact would you have taken the deal specifically if you were mistreated? How many of you brothers and sisters thought after hearing Mr. Welch s claim of APAD I am out of this contact with the police without any damages until they apply for a job apartment or a business license that they rightfully deserve and they are turned down. Anyone can literary make a public record request for all your names and your crimes at any time. The violence we experience in South St Pete is a consequence of so many bad interactions with the police and lack of opportunities as a result. Mr. Welch even said in the referenced debate that the main feedback he received from his private meeting is that the youth feel hopeless without a path to success. Some candidates Rice and Boland running for the office did not need a private meeting to come up to this conclusion. A quick look at his campaign finance donations show the same Trump supporters that are donating to Blackmon are also donating to Mr. Welch in record number. My biggest disappointment with the candidate he was racially profiled 30 years ago and we still are today. What have you done to stop racially motivated arrests? He praised the Sheriff for adopting the same useless bodycam system that SPPD adopted. We wonder why after the Sheriff resisted accountability for decades and all of a sudden he had no issue adopting bodycams. The bodycams system is made for their benefits just like APAD. This is the farce that career politicians play that bothers me. He has been in office for 20 years and has yet to produce a balance approach to public safety crime and punishment and police accountability. Public safety should not be done at the sole expense of minority groups and poor citizens. Just as police accountability should not be done at the expense of good police officers.  Onto the next opportunist: Robert Blackmon is so far the obvious Trumper in the race. He would like you to believe that systemic racism is no longer an issue in SPPD. This is a headscratcher. However when you are financed by the Trump machine red meat is the name of the game. How can this racial issues denier white washer and whataboutism puppet fix our racial divide and heal us? Privilege is writing your own narrative unchallenged so you dont have to acknowledge uncomfortable facts. Systemic racism is still a problem in SPPD may be better but not gone. The latest race riot in St. Pete took place in 1996. Whats next the Courageous 12 of SPPD is a myth. This candidates claim that SPPD is one of the most diverse police departments in the country is false. SPPD does not even come close. The last graduating class as of this writing of 14 SPPD officers 12 were white men. Such chicanery.  Pete Boland: We had not heard of Pete until this debate. We were fortunate that we could seat down and talk about his campaign at one of his establishments. Our first question to him: Why are you running? According to Pete he is running only after candidates he felt should be in the race declined to run. He did not see his republican values reflected in any of the candidates. Pete is a successful businessman who had his own issues with the law and overcame them. Pete will tell you that if he were not white maybe this would not be possible. The candidate is down-to-earth well liked and thumped at the same rhythm as downtown St. Pete. What we like about Pete is his sincerity about the issues and his unpolished language. He is currently the only candidate that is actively and publicly talking about a balanced approach to public safety and police reform. Petes vision for SPPD is a well-paid well-taken-care-of and well-monitored police department. He wants SPPD to be the envy of all police departments in the nation. He reminds our group of Eric Adams approach to policing. Pete speaks the common mans language and we believe the St. Pete republicans are putting their money on the wrong candidate.  Darden Rice: At this point her vision for the city is fully in focus. That vision is not quite well framed when it comes to a concrete plan that she will enact for a balance approach to public safety and police accountability. We believe that she can move in a balance way to bring accountability while ensuring that every good officers are well taking care of and our streets are safe.  In that context we are asking an open question to the candidates that acknowledge the existence of systemic racism in SPPD. Frankly this question should have been framed in that way months ago by our media. It should not be a contrast of Do you believe systemic racism exists in SPPD? vs How will you handle violent crimes in the city? Heres our question lets see who will be brave enough to answer it: The police reform effort created many divisions within police departments city halls neighborhoods and cities. We see a disengagement from law enforcement officers that fed a rise in violent crimes throughout the country. As Mayor how would you balance public safety and police accountability in St. Pete?,political,Facebook

"OPINION FROM FOX NEWS!  June 12 2020  TRUMP SINKING IN POLLS - VOTERS TIRED OF HIS FAILURES AND ANGRY TWEETS..  By Leslie Marshall | Fox News  Millions of Americans are fed up with divider-in-chief Donald Trump and the awful job hes done dealing with the coronavirus pandemic that has killed over 113000 Americans and protests sparked by the murder of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police  among his many failures.  As a result President Trumps poll ratings are sinking and the prospects are increasing that former Vice President Joe Biden will send Trump into political retirement in the November election.  Trump has appealed only to his base and sought to fan the flames of division and conflict between Americans. This is one more sign of the incompetent leadership of our reality TV president and it is also an unwise political move.  Hillary Clinton received about 3 million more votes than Trump in the 2016 presidential election but lost in the Electoral College. Trump is taking a huge gamble if he thinks he can be reelected while trailing by millions of popular votes again because Biden and his team have no doubt learned from Clintons mistakes and are focused on doing better in the Ele.  Trump has in effect changed the name of our country from the United States to the Divided States of America. He has increased s gains with African-Americans will be lost if he does not lead on police reform  In the 1976 Academy Award-winning film Network the main character  a TV news anchor  persuades his viewers around the country to open their windows and shout: Im mad as hell and Im not going to take this anymore. Americans arent yelling that out their windows today but with their marches protests and expressions of opposition to Trump in opinion polls they are effectively conveying that sentiment regarding the Trump presidency.  Biden now the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee is leading Trump in nearly every poll. After following stay-at-home orders in effect earlier in his home state of Delaware to fight the spread of the coronavirus pandemic he ventured out on Memorial Day to honor our fallen military service members.  And unlike Trump  who ignores guidance from his own Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and acts as if he is above the law and all rules that apply to others  Biden has worn a mask to protect those around him and himself from the coronavirus.  Biden is getting out more now and appearing frequently in the media to offer the American people a sensible alternative to the chaotic impulsive uninformed and disastrous leadership of Trump.  The latest opinion polls show Biden with a significant lead over Trump on a national level of around 10 percentage points. And a CNN poll this week gave Biden a staggering 14 percentage point lead over the president.  Trump has in effect changed the name of our country from the United States to the Divided States of America.  The CNN poll has been criticized by some as an outlier. But several major national polls (CNN ABC-Washington Post Monmouth Quinnipiac and Fox News) show Biden rising by between 3 and 8 percent from the middle of March until now.  While the NBC-Wall Street Journal poll did not show Biden gaining ground since March it gave him a 7-point lead over Trump.  In crucial swing states  including Arizona Florida Michigan North Carolina Pennsylvania and Wisconsin  the Democratic Super PAC Priorities USA shows Bidens support has increased by as much as 3 percent since March.  The horrific murder of George Floyd  an unarmed black man on the ground in handcuffs and not resisting police  has galvanized our nation to the mistreatment of African-Americans at the hands of police and to the larger issue of racism and unequal treatment and opportunity for our black population.  A cellphone video recorded Floyds death as a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes ignoring Floyds desperate cries that he could not breathe. Three other officers stood by as the life was squeezed out of Floyds body.  Thankfully all four officers have now been charged with second-degree murder or aiding and abetting second-degree murder.  To his credit Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate Floyds murder to see if a federal crime was committed and has condemned Floyds killing. But the president has devoted most of his attention to attacking the minority of protesters who engaged in looting and other illegal activities.  And Trump bears responsibility for law enforcement officers forcibly ejecting peaceful protesters from a park in front of the White House so he could walk to a nearby church for a photo-op posing with a Bible.  Biden has expressed far more sympathy for Floyds death and for continued discrimination that African-Americans face. He even traveled to personally meet with Floyds family members to express his sympathy for their loss.  For all of you who are hurting so badly Im so sorry for your loss Biden said in a video message. This nation grieves with you. Take some solace from the fact we all grieve l y  And speaking directly to Floyds 6-year-old daughter Bin said on video: Little Gianna as I said to you when I saw you yesterday youre so brave. Daddys looking down and hes so proud of you. I know you have a lot of questions. No child should have to ask questions that too many black children have had to ask for generations  why? Why is daddy gone? Looking through your eyes we should ask why are the answers so often too cruel and painful.  Now is the time for racial justice Biden continued. That is the answer we must give to our children when they ask why.

"Errors mistakes blunders incompetence failures that is Biden & his administration. It's a comedy of errors except it is no comedy but rather a ""tragedy of errors"" ! Just when you think the incompetence could not be any worse you find out that it is much worse. The Afghanistan withdrawal was a complete unnecessary disaster and we lost dozens of innocent lives including 13 of our own soldiers. Only God knows how many Americans we have left hopelessly behind. The government will not tell us the truth. Today we found out that the drone strike killed 10 innocent people 7 of which were children and not any terrorist as previously claimed. This is atrocious and criminal and Biden should go on trial with those inept generals and commanders in charge. Biden rushed to action to "" correct"" his blunderous withdrawal and killed innocent people. How can you be so stupid yet so arrogant ?

Fighting for Our Freedom  American freedom is under attack. Our Judeo-Christian heritage is being maligned and marginalized. The Second Amendment is weakening and radical ideals are changing our country. As a true conservative Greg will neither apologize nor compromise the principles of his faith. Freedom comes from our Creator is codified in our Constitution and must not be supplanted by the socialist/Marxist agenda of the Democrat Party and the compromising Republicans who stand with them.

February 1 2017 In a rollback of an Obama-era protection Donald Trumps White House withdrew the Mercury Effluent Rule which regulated the safe use and disposal of mercury in American dental offices. The Natural Resource Defense Council estimated the repeal would discharge five tons of the neurotoxic substance into water supplies each year. Even trace amounts of mercury can harm brain function and damage the human nervous system particularly in pregnant women and infants.  65.  February 1 2017  Trump and House Republicans rolled back an Obama-era regulation that required oil companies to provide purchasing information! when buying minerals from foreign governments. Concerned that oil companies would purchase oil from corrupt and violent foreign administrations the SEC had originally said Obamas regulation would combat government corruption through transparency and accountability. The repeal had long been on the oil lobbys wish list and will save oil industry giants about half a billion dollars per year in compliance costs.  66.  February 2 2017  Donald Trump vowed to dismantle the Johnson Amendment a law which restricted churches and other religious institutions from taking a public political stance while retaining tax-exempt status. When following through on his promised repeal proved legislatively difficult Trump signed an executive order encouraging leniency on enforcement of the amendment.  67.  February 3 2017  Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai rolled back an agreement with nine internet service providers that had encouraged ISPs to provide affordable internet access to low-income communities. This reversed the decision of Pais Obama-era predecessor Tom Wheeler and will remove a $9.25 per month credit for low-income households to purchase internet service.  68.  February 4 2017  Donald Trump posted a report to his Facebook page saying Kuwait would institute a travel ban on many Muslim-majority countries. The report was not truthful; Kuwait did no such thing. The Assistant Foreign Minister of Kuwait responded to Trumps false Facebook post: The State of Kuwait believes that granting of visa [sic] is a sovereign matter and is not linked to terrorism or violence or nationality or faith.  69.  February 4 2017  Donald Trump questioned the legitimacy of the federal judge who had blocked his travel ban calling Judge James Robart a so-called judge whose dissenting opinion had taken law-enforcement away from our country. Justice Robart had received a unanimous endorsement of well-qualified from the American Bar Association before his appointment to the bench by George W. Bush.  70.  February 7 2017  The Republican-led House Administration Committee voted to eliminate the Elections Assistance Commission which was the only federal agency charged with ensuring voting machines could not be hacked. Chairman of the committee Rep. Gregg Harper R-Mississippi stated the committee had outlived its usefulness to the nation. Only weeks prior to the EACs dissolution Donald Trump claimed hacks of voting machines allowed 3 million of people to vote illegally in the 2016 election. No evidence exists to support this claim.  71.  February 7 2017  In another rollback of Obama-era policies the House voted to eliminate two regulations on American education: the Teacher-Preparation Rule which ensured new teachers would enter classrooms fully qualified to teach; in addition to the School Accountability Act which evaluated the quality of service American schools provided to their students and distributed funds accordingly. Civil rights advocates have explained that the latter rule was vital to providing education budget for low-income schools and its removal could thereby harm funding for poorer areas of the country.  72.  February 7 2017  Donald Trump stated the murder rate in America had reached a 47-year peak. This was not true. While there had been a slight increase in murders from 2014 to 2015 the murder rate for both years was still more than 40 percent lower than it had been 47 years ago. In 1970 there were nearly 8 murders per 100000 people in America; in 2015 the latest year with full data collected by the FBI that number had fallen to 4.9 murders per 100000 people.  73.  February 7 2017  Donald Trump told a sheriff in Rockwell County Texas to destroy the career of a state senator who had opposed civil asset forfeiture. This controversial law enforcement practice allows police officers to seize cash and assets they believe may be related to a crime even if the property owners were never arrested or convicted of that crime.  74.  February 7 2017  Vice President Mike Pence cast a tie-breaking vote to confirm Donald Trumps appointment of Betsy DeVos as education secretary. At the time of her appointment to lead the Department of Education DeVos had no government experience and no experience working in public schools.  75.  February 8 2017  Despite extreme opposition the Senate confirmed Jeff Sessions as attorney general.

February 8 2017  President Trump used Twitter to lash out at Nordstrom for its decision to stop carrying his daughters retail brand. He tweeted about the company My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly.  77. February 9 2017  Donald Trump attacked Senator John McCain on Twitter. McCain had raised objections to the Yemen raid wherein one American soldier was killed and five others were wounded. Trump tweeted about McCain Only emboldens the enemy! Hes been losing so long he doesnt know how to win anymore. McCain was a prisoner of war in the Vietnam War enduring torture and solitary confinement after his plane was shot down in North Vietnam.  78.  February 9 2017  When meeting with senators Donald Trump addressed Democrats by saying that Pocahontas is now the face of your party. The racial epithet referenced Elizabeth Warren who has claimed Native American ancestry.  79.  February 9 2017  Three times in one week White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer referred to recent terrorist attacks in Atlanta which never actually happened. The City of Atlanta has not had a terrorist attack in 21 years in 1997 when Christian extremist Eric Robert Rudolph bombed Centennial Olympic Park. After misspeaking for the third time Sean Spicer acknowledged his mistake and explained that he meant to reference the nightclub attack in Orlando Florida in June 2016.  80.  February 9 2017  Senior White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted Ivanka Trumps retail brand while speaking on television in her official capacity as an aide to President Trump. Go buy Ivankas stuff is what I would tell you Conway said on Fox and Friends Im going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today everybody. Sales for Ivankas brand skyrocketed that day almost tripling after Conways appearance. Jason Chaffetz the Republican Chairman of the House Oversight Committee joined ranking Democrats in jointly issuing a letter to the Office of Government Ethics calling for a review of Conways comments. In response to inquiries on disciplinary action for Conway Press Secretary Sean Spicers stated she had been counseled on her behavior.  81.  February 9  2017  Before a day of golf with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe Donald Trump tweeted that refugees were flooding in from the seven suspect countries his travel ban had outlawed and that these refugees were SO DANGEROUS. In January Fox News reported that no terrorist attacks had been perpetrated by refugees from countries on Trumps list.  82.  February 9 2017  Donald Trump knew about Michael Flynns contact with a Russian ambassador for weeks before Flynns resignation as a national security adviser. Reportedly the Justice Department warned Trump about their concerns with Flynn on January 26 2017; Michael Flynns forced resignation did not arrive until February 13 more than three weeks later.  83.  February 11 2017  Donald Trump claimed without evidence that 3 million illegal votes went to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. Politifact and Snopes have both debunked the claimwith Snopes saying the 3 million non-citizens may just as well have been plucked out of thin air. The number appeared to originate from an InfoWars article which sought to explain why Donald Trump lost the popular vote by 2.9 million votes.  84.  February 12 2017  In a televised interview with George Stephanopoulos senior White House policy adviser Stephen Miller reaffirmed Donald Trumps unsubstantiated suspicion of voter fraud in the presidential election. When challenged for evidence by Stephanopoulos Miller replied This morning on this show is not the venue for me to lay out all the evidence. But I can tell you this voter fraud is a serious problem in this country. Miller never subsequently offered any evidence for his claim.  85.  February 12 2017  In a tweet from their official account the Department of Education misspelled the name of W.E.B. Du Bois. In a follow-up tweet apologizing for the error the Department of Education misspelled the word apologies.  86. - February 12 2017  In the wake of Donald Trumps travel ban some international travelers faced increased scrutiny at airports and in some cases were asked to deliver digital information to Border Protection. Sidd Bikkannavar a natural-born U.S. citizen and scientist at NASA was detained at an airport in Texas upon his return from Chile and pressured into unlocking his cell phone for search. Haisam Elsharkawi an American citizen and electronics salesman from Anaheim California surrendered his cell phone after persistent pressure from border control. He said in an interview that border control told him they would confiscate the phone if he did not comply. Elsharkawi said I opened the doors of hell when I asked for a lawyer. They just started attacking me verbally. Why do you need a lawyer? Are you a criminal? What are you hiding?  87.  February 12 2017  After receiving news that North Korea had fired a ballistic missile (the first during Donald Trumps presidency) Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe strategized during dinner in the main dining room at Trumps Mar-a-Lago resort in full view of other diners.  88.  February 13 2017  Less than one month after Trump took office Michael Flynn resigned as national security adviser. His resignation followed the public revelation that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about his contact with Russians. Contrary to what Michael Flynn had told Pence Flynn had discussed Russian sanctions in a December meeting with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.  89.  February 14 2017  Kellyanne Conway told the press that Michael Flynns resignation had been voluntary. Just hours later Sean Spicer said Whether or not he actually misled the vice president was the issue and that was ultimately what led to the president asking for and accepting the resignation of General Flynn.  90.  February 14 2017  The day after Michael Flynn resigned FBI Director James Comey reported Donald Trump requested a private meeting] [BP2] to talk about Mike Flynn. Trump told Comey that Flynn had misled Mike Pence about his conversations with Russian representatives but that Flynn was a good guy. Trump said he hoped Comey could let this go.  91.  February 14 2017  In the wake of Michael Flynns resignation for lying to senior officials and interacting with Russian representatives after the election Donald Trump tweeted The real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington? Will these leaks be happening as I deal with N.Korea etc?  92.  February 14 2017  The House Ways and Means Committee rejected a Democratic proposal requesting Donald Trump release his tax returns Under federal tax law the chairman of the committee can request tax information from the treasury. Chairman of the committee Republican Kevin Brady declined to exercise that power in Trumps case citing invasion of taxpayers privacy rights.  93.  February 15 2017  Vice President Mike Pence falsely stated that no member of the Trump campaign including national security adviser Michael Flynn had contact with Russian officials. Pence publicly defended Flynns phone calls to Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak claiming Flynn did not discuss sanctions against Russia (Flynn later confessed to the FBI that he had). Pence did not realize that Flynn had misled him until two weeks after he made his public assertion well after Donald Trump had become aware of Flynns Russian contacts.  94.  February 16 2017  Donald Trump asked April Ryan an African American reporter and White House correspondent if she would arrange a meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus. After Ryan asked a question about Trump meeting with the Caucus he said Do you want to set up the meeting? Are they friends of yours?  95.  February 16 2017  Staff at the United States Department of Agriculture were given a list of blacklisted terms which the agency would no longer use in their scientific research. The memo instructed scientists to replace climate change with weather extremes and reduce greenhouse gases with build soil organic matter increase nutrient use efficiency. Explaining the decision in an email the Deputy Chief of Programs wrote It has become clear one of the previous administrations priority is not consistent with that of the incoming administration. Namely that priority is climate change. Please visit with your staff and make them aware of this shift in perspective within the executive branch.  96.  February 16 2017  Using the Congressional Review Act Donald Trump repealed the so-called stream protection rule which kept coal companies from dumping mining debris into rivers. Barack Obama first implemented the regulation after a growing body of evidence suggested the debris could contain toxic materials such as selenium mercury and arsenic. Trumps repeal has been on the wish list for the coal industry since the rules publication in December of 2016.  97.  February 16 2017  In the first two months of 2017 Republican lawmakers scheduled only 88 town hall meetings with their constituents. In 2015 by comparison Republicans held 222 town halls during the same two-month period.  98.  February 17 2017  In what has become a regular attack on free press Donald Trump tweeted The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes @NBCNews @ABC @CBS @CNN) is not my enemy it is the enemy of the American People!  99.  February 18 2017  The Department of Homeland Security drafted a proposal to mobilize the National Guard in an effort to arrest undocumented immigrants. While the DHS never implemented the proposal and the White House denied it had existed in the first place (despite the 11-page memo leaking to the Associated Press) Washington lawmakers saw the draft as an indication that the Trump administration was willing to consider military force as a means of rounding up undocumented immigrants.  100.  February 19 2017  The Trump administration asked the Council of Economic Advisers to predict a 3.5% surge in economic production over the next decade. Compared to the 1.8% projected by the Federal Reserve this calculation could be dangerously optimistic. The risk explained the president of the Committee Responsible for Federal Budget is that rosy economic scenarios allow us to borrow trillions of additional dollars in the next couple of years doing real damage.  101.  February 20 2017  Donald Trump signed an executive order that instructed the Bureau of Land Management to lift a moratorium on new coal mining leases for federal land. A full 40 percent of the coal mined in America comes from federal property. In one such state-owned region the Powder River Basin of Wyoming and Montana private companies produced coal that accounts for 10 percent of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. The Obama administration introduced the original moratorium on new mining leases to curb the environmental consequences of coal. Without renewal the current leases would have allowed mining to continue as is for another 20 years; now with Trumps decision to permit renewed leases that timeframe may extend much further into the future.  102.  February 22 2017  The Trump International Hotel in Washington D.C. received an estimated $40000-$60000 for hosting an event held by the Embassy of Kuwait. This violates the foreign emoluments clause of the Constitution which forbids government officials from accepting any present Emolument Office or Title of any kind whatever from any King Prince or foreign State. Trump never divested from his companies and thus has continued to benefit from payments to the Trump Organization.  103.  Feburary 22 2017  Donald Trump signed an executive order halting an Obama-era directive that allowed transgender students to use the school bathroom corresponding to their gender identity. Civil rights groups said the executive order would reinforce a culture of discrimination and could further endanger transgender students.  104.  February 23 2017  Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the Justice Department would renew its contracts with for-profit prisons. This reversed an Obama-era decision to phase out federal use of private correctional facilities. In decades past privately-run facilities were used to address the U.S.s overflowing public prisons which saw the number of incarcerated people skyrocket 800 percent between 1980 and 2013. After Barack Obama introduced a series of significant prison reforms in 2013 (most significantly a directive to lower sentences for non-violent offenders) the Justice Department anticipated less demand for corporate-run prisons as the number of prisoners was expected to dwindle significantly. Because the Trump administration announced a new crackdown on crime Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the Justice Department would need to renew contracts with the private institutions in order to meet the future needs of the federal correctional system.  105.  February 24 2017  After Donald Trumps speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference where he declared certain media outlets to be FAKE NEWS White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer temporarily barred the New York Times CNN and Politico from the daily White House press briefing. While reporters from these publications were not permitted into the briefing the Trump administration allowed entrance for correspondents from Fox News and Breitbart News.  106.  February 24 2017  After Donald Trumps election Republican lawmakers in 18 states proposed new legislation intended to curb mass protests. Among these were increased consequences for protests blocking roadways new punishments for any demonstrators wearing a mask and in Arizona a law which would allow the state to seize the assets of any person attending a protest which later turned violent.  107.  February 25 2017  Donald Trump announced he would not attend the White House Correspondents Dinner. Without further explanation Trump tweeted I will not be attending the White House Correspondents Association Dinner this year. Please wish everyone well and have a great evening! The last president to skip the dinner was Ronald Reagan in 1981 who at the time had been recovering from an assassination attempt.  108.  February 26 2017  The Trump Organization claimed it had made good on its promise to donate all profits earned from foreign governments to the U.S. Treasury. However it provided no evidence of how much it donated or how that amount was calculated. Since his company has accepted payments from foreign governments (see numbers 41 42 63 102 135 210 277 319) Donald Trump may have violated the Constitutions Emoluments Clause which prohibits any U.S. official from receiving gifts or compensation from another nations government. By all recent evidence Trump has neither divested from his companies nor set up a blind trust for his assets.  109.  February 27 2017  In his first budget proposal Donald Trump boosted defense and security spending by $54 billion. He proposed slashing the budget for non-defense spending in areas like education science poverty programs and environmental protection by almost the same amount.  110.  February 27 2017  The Justice Department dropped its long-standing claim that a Texas voter I.D. law discriminated against black and Latino voters. The announcement ended a 6-year period of opposition against the I.D. law indicating the DoJs new priorities under Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the Trump administration. Sessions has a history of favoring controversial views surrounding voter identity once going so far as to say the Voting Rights Actthe landmark piece of federal legislation which protected equal voting rights for minority Americanswas an intrusive act. The new Texas voter I.D. law has long garnered criticism for imposing hurdles which disproportionately affect minority voters. In August of 2017 a federal judge granted a permanent injunction against the I.D. law ruling that lawmakers had created it with discriminatory intent.  111.  February 28 2017  To stop a long string of press leaks Donald Trump approved a rule allowing White House senior staff to examine the cell phones of anyone working in the White House. According to Politico senior staffers invited aides to an emergency meeting wherein the junior staffers had to relinquish all mobile devices for search. Press Secretary Sean Spicer led the charge on the operation informing junior staffers that apps such as Signal and Confideencrypted messaging appswould violate the Presidential Records Act. Spicer warned staffers against speaking to the press about the emergency meetings; the story was almost immediately leaked to the press.

Texans and Floridians have the ability to save our country from horrible strife. Donald Trump is setting the stage to put into question the results of the election with court fights over mail in ballots in battleground states. This will almost certainly cause massive demonstrations. Right wing groups and militias are preparing to take to the streets with weapons to counter the demonstrations. Some of these groups like the Oath Keepers are former military and active duty law enforcement. If Trump loses Texas and Florida at the ballot box with in-person voting he will have no legal recourse but to relinquish power. If you are a voter on the fence you must exercise your right to vote. If at all possible do this in person. With early voting starting soon you should be able to vote with little line or inconvenience. If you are a Republican and not an adherent of the racist groups like Proud Boys and Bugaloos then you should see the damage this man has done to your party. It is time you took your party back by getting rid of this scourge. I understand that it would be extremely difficult to vote for a Democrat for president but the country can survive a four year democratic presidency much better than the Republican party can survive with this man as its leader. Go ahead and vote for your party's candidates for congress and the Democrats won't be able to get much done.

When Race Identity Trumps Your Hungry Belly  By Helena R Edwards  What does poor Whites in West Virginia and poor Blacks in Alabama have in common? Poverty. They both want to be able to put a roof over the heads of their families clothes on their backs food in their bellies and for their children to get an education so that they would grow up and become adults who have life a little easier than how they currently have it. The Wild and Wonderful Whites of West Virginia is a documentary that is featured on Amazon Prime. I recommend viewing of it for those who seek understanding. These folks seem to be descendants of Scott Irish and they racially identify as whites but their lives are far from privileged. They have more in common with Lalees Kin - another documentary on YouTube about a family who identifies as Black in Alabama. This documentary highlights the legacy of cotton on the family.  When a poor white family who is trying to survive on public assistance somewhere in Appalachia or upstate New York hears other people talk about White Privilege they become irate. For them life is a living hell. They hardly can make ends meet. Their children are on opiates attempting to medicate the hardships of their experiences and yet some people have the audacity to say that they have white privilege. What makes it more infuriating for them is when they turn on their only television set and see a parade of Black faces on CNN who are doing far better than them. So in their world Affirmative Action is putting Blacks ahead of them while they are stuck in the Appalachian dirt poor white and unprivileged.  This is the poor Appalachian white individuals reality. How can you convince him that he or she is wrong? You certainly cant win the argument that the Black faces paraded on CNN arent doing better than he or she is and you certainly cannot argue that whiteness has given him or her an advantage in his or her current state. So as a result of his or her reality and the narrative that is pushed he or she becomes angry at the Blacks whom he or she deems are given an unfair advantage.  This poor White Appalachian angry mans or womans eyes are not focused at the top - on the rulers of the country. He or she isnt measuring the booty of the one percent. He or she is only focusing on the scarce resources that is distributed between the 99 percent that are also experiencing pressure from the rulers on top. Its like two employees who apply for a position at work. One employee was given the job. The employee who didnt get the job is angry with the employee who got the job rather than the bosses who gave the job to the other employee. The employee who didnt get the job cant afford to be angry with the bosses because he risks losing the current job he has so he takes his anger out on his competition. This is a dynamic in distribution of scarce resources.  Robert Kennedy Jr. seemed to have understood the dynamics of scarce resources and those of poverty. He was working to unite poor people in Appalachia with poor people from the cotton fields in Alabama but he was deemed a threat by those who dont want to increase the amount of resources to be distributed to the 99 percent. Donald Trump also seems to understand these dynamics and he too was working to increase the resources of the poor Appalachian and the poor Alabaman but race became his Achilles Heel. The people who want to keep the poor people divided since 1676 when the Bacon Rebellion highlighted the threat to them when slaves and indentured servants come together used race once more as they did in 1676 to permanently bridge the gap between the haves and the have nots.  Donald Trump is a better human being than Bill Clinton Barack Obama George W. Bush Joe Biden and the lot of these Presidents put together. His administration treated the opiate afflicted as humans in funding treatment for their rehabilitation. Bill Clinton George W. Bush and the Black Messiah Barack Obama failed in doing the same for those afflicted with the crack cocaine epidemic. On the contrary Joe Biden Bill Clinton and Kamala Harris all sent these crack afflicted individuals to jail and Biden and Clinton rendered them homeless as they were barred from public housing.  Barack Obama pretended to consume water from Flint Michigan that was lead infected as a way of convincing the Black people in Flint that this poisonous water was safe for them to drink. Donald Trump might not be cultured or might not be blessed with Miss Manners social graces but he regarded the poor and the drug afflicted as humans rather than trash. But the poor Black people couldnt see that Donald Trump was working to lift them out of poverty. They became blinded by the rhetoric from race theory. Unfortunately race theory in America has become so ingrained that some poor people will choose starvation rather than give up their racial identities.,political,Facebook
"An American Nationalist Voting Index - The Square Deal  This is part of a series examining the issues in the presidential election. To see other articles in the series visit the website version of this article cited below and click on the 2020 Elections tab on the Home page.  Score Biden-.5 Trump +2  Roosevelts commitment to the working man was born of two incidents of violence in his life that challenged his fundamentally conservative impulses. The first was the assassination of President William McKinley by an anarchist which led to Roosevelts succession to the presidency. The anarchists were the Antifa/Islamic terrorists of their time and arose out of the economic inequality and discontent that were byproducts of the Industrial Revolution. The second was his service with the Rough Riders in the Spanish-American war. TR saw bravery in both poor Cowboys and privileged Northeast elite in the charge up San Juan Hill and believed their government owed them a square deal for that bravery which he defined as follows:  ""But when I say am for the square deal I mean not merely that I stand for fair play under the present rules of the game but that I stand for having those rules changed so as to work for a more substantial equality of opportunity and of reward for equally good service.""  At the same time he expected the average worker to respond by contributing to his family community and country not simply demanding a handout from the government.  In todays economy we need to change the rules on economic concentration trade and immigration to give American workers a real chance to achieve the American Dream of stable and independent financial security. Biden and Trump have verifiable records with successes and failures on these issues.  Antitrust Law  The abuses of Big Tech have revived interest in antitrust policy and exposed its deficiencies in todays world economy. The problem lies in the fact we are still trying to regulate these 21st century monopolies using 19th century laws. We learned in the 2008 financial crisis that allowing companies to become too big to fail created a new form of monopoly rents by allowing elites to privatize profits while socializing their risk of loss. Meanwhile Big Tech was finding new ways to leverage customer data to monopolize the Internet advertising and product sales market.  The Trump Administrations challenge to the ATT-Time Warner merger attempted to build a case against bigness itself by attacking vertical mergers. Unfortunately the DC circuit Court of Appeals upheld the merger on the grounds it created useful efficiencies which completely misses the point. They also recently filed a lawsuit against Google over their use of their monopoly power over Internet searches to raise advertising prices. However they have failed to pursue modernization of the antitrust laws themselves Despite this failure these two innovative suits earn Trump a + .5.  The Obama Administration also had an active antitrust docket and challenged several mergers with limited success. The losses in both the Obama and Trump Administrations emphasize the need for a modernization of the rules. The Democratic House also just released a comprehensive report on Big Techs abuses of their market power that could serve as a start for a re-tooling of the statutes. All of this suggests Biden should be given a +.5 on the issue as well.  Trade  Protecting America and its workers from unfair international trade practices has been an area where the Trump Administration has shined. They understood the importance of a strong manufacturing sector and have not subjugated American policy to the slow and sometimes hostile mechanisms of the World Trade Organization. Alan Tonelson of RealityChek has pointed out that the tariffs against China and others have not prevented the manufacturing sector form succeeding during the pandemic without a loss of jobs (see his post from October 19). At the same time the administration preserved the strategically important partnership between the US Canada & Mexico by concluding the U.S.- Mexico-Canada Agreement. Trump deserves a +1 for these achievements.  Bidens record and positions are almost the polar opposite. He wants to return to the multilateral approach ignoring Americas unique great power interest in preserving its internal economic strength. However he has also said he would relax the Chinese tariffs gradually and only upon concessions from the Chinese. Biden says he would prioritize developing an international coalition to challenge Chinese state capitalism as well. The latter positions reduce his negative score to a -.5.  Immigration  Trumps actions to restrict illegal immigration have been divisive haphazard and often poorly justified on ethnic nationalist grounds. However they have changed the dynamic and started to limit the use of immigrant workers to compete with Americans (see my post Immigration  The New Slavery). However Trump failed to seize the opportunity to pass comprehensive immigration legislation when he had a Republican Congress. Because of this failure he deserves only a +.5 on the issue.  Biden and the Democrats have understandably concentrated on the necessity of legalizing immigrants that have been here for years. They then oppose any real future controls on immigration and would expand the number of HIVB-style visas thus allowing big companies to use foreign workers to continue to pay substandard wages. As a result they deserve a -.5 on this issue.  Conclusion  Many other changes in the rules of the game are necessary to give American workers the economic opportunities they deserve. Mere income redistribution is not enough. Americans simply want their government to give them a fair chance to compete and contribute; in short the square deal that TR believed in and for which he fought.

Just to show the hypocrisy - President Trump gets his taxes released illegally by New York Times. It get splashed all over social media & MSM regarding his paying only $750 on these returns and that he owes $400 million dollars. If you know taxes he has paid millions like we have paid thousands. We still have no idea who released these to the New York Times. I guess I didn't see the Twitter or Facebook limiting the spreading of this news article. He got asked about these at the last townhall. But we get Hunter Biden's laptop emails come out and these get slapped warnings and bans regarding their legitimacy.

Mission Statement  Common Sense Patriots 76 is taking a page from history to help the public restore its ability to influence local state and federal governance. We do this through writing analysis of political trends empowerment of citizens by providing a voice and town square and calls for effective civil disobedience to halt and reverse Americas move towards fascism.  Position Statement  In 1776 Common Sense rallied colonists to throw off the chains of oppression; common sense became an American institution. Common Sense Patriots 76 honors this wise and practical legacy a traditionthe only traditionthat will guide the struggle to challenge and remove our new oppressor.  For years scholars have debated whether America had become an oligarchy with the elite exerting more influence over governance than average Americans. Those were the good old days.  The current administration is moving quickly toward a National Socialist state. Military top brass former White House officials noted historians and respected psychologists are sounding the collective alarm: The Trump administration as an authoritarian regime has resorted to open hostility is dismantling the rule of law in this country.  Thanks to brilliant cronies who know the loopholes and how best to exploit them Trumps White House is accelerating its consolidation of power by issuing executive orders dismantling oversight and building a fearsome propaganda machine.  How then does the average American stand against tyranny? History has left us a playbook in Thomas Paines treatise Common Sense which rallied colonists to the cause of throwing off its oppressors.  If the first king of any country was by election that likewise establishes precedent for the next; for to say that the right of all future generations is taken away by the act of the first electors in their choice not only of king but of family of kings for ever hath no parallel in or out of scripture but the doctrine of original sin which supposes the free will admit of no other hereditary succession can derive no glory. For as Adam sinned and as the first electors all men obeyed; as in the one all mankind were subjected to Satan and in the other to sovereignty; as our innocence was lost in the first and our authority in the last.  - Thomas Paine on Monarchy Common Sense 1776  Common Sense Patriots 76 will continue the American legacy: We will study plan rally and implement actions for change. We will study the effects. We will learn.  We will do it all again until America is the America envisioned by our forefathers: a bastion of freedom inclusive Democracy American values and morals and unstoppable in the never-ending quest for democratic perfection.,political,Facebook

We call on Sedition Caucus member Ben Cline to denounce his colleague MT Greene who on camera over at least two years has been stalking and harassing Rep. Ocasio-Cortez.  Greenes obsession with hounding and vilifying Rep. Ocasio-Cortez would be a pitiful and comtemptible display of one mentally disturbed woman's psyche if it weren't for the fact that her behavior is at least verbally reflected and magnified throughout the Republican Party.  AOC has been unjustly targeted by the entire Republican Party for constant relentless vilification. She has maintained her grace and dignity and her effectiveness as a Congresswoman in spite of what the GOP has put her through.  This is but another episode in the fall of the Republican Party/Trump Cult; an organization that exploits even nurtures sad pitiable and potentially dangerously sick individuals like MTG.  AOC raised $5 million for Texans who suffered without power in February. Green stripped of Committee assignments raised $3 million for herself in the first quarter 2021. Hate and harassment pay in the GQP.  There is nothing Grand about the GOP. And since Ben wouldnt even reveal his vote on Cheney were not holding our breath that he will speak up now. We deserve better.  #VoteBlue,political,Facebook
"I condemn terrorism of any kind! It doesn't matter the race or the religion of the terrorist. Unfortunately the Wolverine Watchman group of terrorists set up their training camp on the same dirt road as my grandma's house in the Luther area. It is hard to consider a group of men with the goal of kidnapping our governor and overthrowing our state government with groups of giggling cousins exploring the vast woods behind Grandma's house.  We would climb the rolling hills explore the woods and pick the wild flowers along the way (it was a long time ago we were kids). If we were doing the same thing in the months leading up to these despicable men's arrest would we have heard the guns as they relentlessly fired into the peace and tranquility of the only place on earth that could bring the same comfort as the words ""Grandma's House""?  Even more incomprehensible than the terrorists themselves is the idea that there are politicians including Donald Trump that aren't calling out these men for what they are. Referring to them as a militia gives a bad name to the militias. It saddens me that as I type this there are those who will see this as a negative in my efforts to win my election.

I want to talk a little bit about election security and Voter Id. More dangerous ground as what I am about to say is likely to annoy both sides. First of all I do not think President Trump lost the last election due to voter fraud. I think his behavior (not his policies) just alienated too many independent voters he needed to repeat his win from 2016. I have researched and researched for any sign of proof of enough fraud to affect this election and have not found any. Add to that Sydney Powells claim that no one would reasonably believe her claim of voting machine fraud that it was only political speech and I just do not see any proof. I am not from Missouri but am very much a show me kind of guy. I want to see the proof and make my own decisions over people telling me what to believe.  Secondly the potential for fraud and abuse in our elections are very much real and we need to be proactive to address it and yes one of these actions means voter IDs. If anything this last election has shown how vulnerable our election system is to doubt being created. These are things that our adversaries will use in the future through misinformation campaigns and psychological operations to create doubt in our constitutional republic system of democracy and to further divide Americans. If we are too busy fighting ourselves we cannot take care of ourselves and our country.  For whatever reason close to half of the country has lost faith in the security of our election system I think restoring that faith is well worth the cost and should be treated like any other threat to our nation.  With all of this being said I do not see either the Republicans or the Democrats being serious about fixing this issue they are both using it to their advantage at the expense of our country. I base this on a simple observation.  From the Republican side if they were really concerned about voter IDs they would take the democratic claim of disenfranchisement and address it. Any security measure we take will cost money. If the Government will require an ID to secure an election then the Government should pay for it and provide it once. If a ID is stolen it could be replaced with a police report to show it was actually stolen. Grants can be established to help pay to get the required documentation (or we could just make it simple with a $100 credit per dependent on next years taxes). Lets say the total cost would average $100 per person. With somewhere over 330 million people you would be looking at $33 billion dollars. Sorry world securing our elections is more important then your aid packages (2019 we sent over $39 billion in foreign aid). For most of us that already have a government issued ID the cost would be much lower than $100.  From the Democrat side they have long had the practice of throwing money at any little problem if they were truly worried about disenfranchisement they would have come up with my recommendation above a long time ago and told the Republicans to put their money where their mouth is. With the mammoth infrastructure bill President Biden is pushing you really think they would not have found $33 billion to put in there if this were a real concern of theirs?  Election security is just another issue the establishments are using to fire up their bases at the potential risk to our country. Voter IDs are just one piece of the picture when it comes to election security but it seems to be the one everyone is talking about.  I will leave you with one last set of figures. $33 billion for Voter Ids or $10 billion to Jeff Bezos so he can get awarded a contract he actually lost? You decide American Voter Security or Corporate welfare.,political,Facebook

Last night voters sent several messages (plus add'l analysis):  1) Durham voters want change but not too fast. All the candidates (with maybe the exception of Sylvester Williams) supported the new non-violent Community Safety Department. But Durham said they want slower change on that front. No commitments but conditions based. Candidates promising that were victorious last night.  2) Putting in the work still matters. AJ Williams drew the Ward 3 race to a photo finish through hard work both during the election and his past work in the advocacy space.  3) Campaign messaging still matters. Both here and in VA we saw the strength of a good (or bad) campaign message. In Durham Elaine O'Neal's message of made/trained/ready to serve my hometown combined with her record of service translated into dominating a 7 person field. In VA we saw where the Dem trying to make the sweater vest wearing moderate appearing GOP candidate into Donald Trump reincarnate backfired.  4) A new council majority. The Ward 3 race was actually very important as it was the battle over the 4th vote. Now O'Neal will be leading a loose coalition of O'Neal/Freeman/Middleton/L Williams (they did not run as a ticket but did endorse each other).  5) End of an era.

"U.S. AND RUSSIA  Rising tension between the U.S and Russia should be a cause for concern among all Americans. Let me qualify the following by stating that I am not an expert on U.S. Russian relations; but from a layperson's perspective this is what I see.  Russia has been pushed around by the West since its dissolution in December of 1991. At that time it's state dominated command economy was collapsing and there began a movement towards a free market capitalist system first gradually during the late 1980's under the Soviet leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev then very rapidly under Russia's first democratically elected President Boris Yeltsin.  During the economic collapse of the early 1990's western nation's offered aid to Russia largely through the G7--a group of advanced industrialized nations--and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) contingent on the dismantling of the Russian state dominated economic system. The transformation from the old to the new system within Russia was highly controversial with President Boris Yeltsin pushing for reform while Russia's parliamentary body consisting largely of communist and ultranationalist resisted the rapid transformation. This deeply divided the Nation.  It would be hard to overestimate the hardship this transformation imposed on the Russian people. Widespread homelessness child and adult prostitution increased rates of alcoholism decreased life expectancy all accompanied the transformation to the western style economic model. From 1991-1998 during the western aided transformation Russia's GDP fell nearly 40%. During the 1996 presidential election the G7 and the IMF pumped billions of dollars into the Russian economy in order to salvage a Yeltsin victory from a stiff challenge by a communist opponent.  The transformation left deep scars on the Russian people and depending on one's view of the transformation generated resentment against the West. Many among the older generation the intelligentsia and workers longed for a return to Soviet times. Conspiracy theories abound which suggest the West deliberately undermined the Russian state. One argument states that current President Putin's hybrid authoritarian democratic political model where the U.S. was headed under Trump was an effort to establish order out of the chaos of the 1990's. The U.S. condemns Putin's trend towards authoritarianism but in typical U.S. fashion no such condemnation existed when U.S. President Clinton supported the free market oriented Yeltsin's unconstitutional dissolution of the Russian parliament which had resisted the transformation to the capitalist model. It is of course possible that Russia would have suffered equal economic hardship had Russia persisted on its state dominated path but this matters little as people were suffering and the suffering was due to the then current transformation process.  During West-East negotiations over the reunification of Germany during 1990 Russian concerns about NATO expansion eastward towards the Russian border were allayed when U.S. Secretary of State James Baker assured the Russians that NATO would not expand ""one inch eastward"" towards the Russian border. By the end of the 1990's decade NATO expanded: eastward to include three former Soviet Republics; since then it has expanded eastward to include eleven more states most former Soviet Republics three of which: Estonia Latvia and Lithuania lie directly on a Russian border. NATO has a close working relationship with both Georgia and Ukraine both former Soviet Republics which also lie on the Russian border and both of which are working towards NATO membership. Russians find NATO expansion to its borders as threatening and in breach of Western promises to not expand ""one inch eastward"" towards the Russian border.  Russia's 2014 forceful annexation of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula transferred to Ukraine by Russia during 1954 under former Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev can be seen as an effort to protect both the Russian border as well as the Russian Black Sea fleet partially housed on the Crimean peninsula. Further both Ukraine and Georgia have experienced western friendly coups with U.S. support: the degree to which is subject to debate.  Most recently in response to continued tensions between Ukraine and Russia the U.S. has threatened to float two naval warships into the Black Sea which would be the equivalent of Russian warships sailing into the Gulf of Mexico. How do you think that might work out?  The former great power undoubtedly feels threatened and humiliated by the above turn of events. Russia views itself as a world power which has been undermined by the neoliberal economic order. There is no effort here to suggest Russia is more pure than its western counterparts. Hierarchy is hierarchy and it knows no other way than domination and submission. If the tables were turned maybe the Russians would act in the same manner. This assuredly is the view of the hierarchical actors who play this nonsensical game. Just as assuredly however there are people in Russia as in the U.S. who desire peace. It is hard for the peacemakers to rise to power when there is so much turmoil. To even speak of peace is often viewed as naive. If in the U.S a significant peace movement were to evolve this would allow room for the Russians to do the same. If not we are doomed to "" solutions"" by war. There seems to be no shortage of those who belong to the war movement. It is time for the insanity to end.",political,Facebook
Former presidents have a history of taking on a cause to help the country. FORMER President Donald J Trump has a unique opportunity to do something that would help get our country past the devastation and economic problems caused by the pandemic. A significant number of Americans many of them Trump supporters are hesitant to get the vaccines that would get our country to herd immunity. Trump has shown through his bragging about the vaccines and the fact he and Melanie both got vaccinated that he does not share much of the anti vaccine sentiment as many of his followers. If he would enthusiastically encourage his followers to get vaccinated through PSAs and rallies we could maybe reach herd immunity in a few months. Because this might alienate some of his base he would also be showing political courage as well making America great again.,political,Facebook

""Donald Trump sold out the country to our greatest enemy raped or abused two dozen women defrauded the federal government for years serially obstructed justice violated his oath and orchestrated a coup attempt.

Black Lives Matter Silence is NOT an option  DAmatos Seafood grew up in New Haven where so many of our brown and black brothers and sisters have grappled for so very long with the systemic issue of racism.  Our family happened to be born with DNA that wraps us in white skin which means we can simply have no idea what it means to live in this world inside skin of another shade. There are so many daily struggles we have never had to face due to the privilege we have - a privilege we did absolutely nothing to earn but rather was wrapped around us by luck-of-the-draw at birth.  Our DAmatos Seafood family has grown over the years however to include many who were not born with the privilege white skin unfairly grants. People born inside skin of many other beautiful shades. And though we can never actually know what the experience of living in a system in which racism is firmly entrenched is like our brown and black brothers and sisters have shared with us their lives and their stories. These stories have shone a light. They have given us a glimpse. Just a glimpse of course. But that glimpse alone has broken our hearts.  As the spotlight has swung again for a moment on what has always been revealing once more what our black and brown brothers and sisters have daily faced we at DAmatos are outraged by the murder of George Floyd and mourn with and pray for all who know and love him.  But to be outraged is not enough.  Moving forward DAmatos Seafood will be making donations to organizations devoted to shifting the scale towards equality such as the NAACP. We will champion ideas that seek to uproot from its deepest places the system wide entrenched racism that has ensnarled its tentacles around so much. Forefront in our minds at this moment is enacting policy that addresses police brutality. For instance we believe law should be passed that will decertify police officers fired for using excessive force making it impossible for them to simply be hired as an officer somewhere else which currently often happens. We believe that once an officer has breached the sacred oath they have taken to protect and serve they should not be allowed to wear the badge again. That badge carries such power holding peoples freedom and lives in the balance and only people of incredible courage yes but more importantly deep decency should be allowed to wear it. We pledge to vote for candidates who support changes such as these and to donate to organizations moving the cause forward.  Of course this process will be long and difficult and will take our daily attention. We wanted our community particularly those members of our community who have suffered so very much to know that as we grieve for George Floyd and work to make America what it is supposed to be a place where all people are treated equally under the law we stand with you we kneel with you we ARE with you.  For further actionable items we agree with every word of what Ben and Jerry have posted in their mission statement -  All of us at Ben & Jerrys are outraged about the murder of another Black person by Minneapolis police officers last week and the continued violent response by police against protestors. We have to speak out. We have to stand together with the victims of murder marginalization and repression because of their skin color and with those who seek justice through protests across our country. We have to say his name: George Floyd.  George Floyd was a son a brother a father and a friend. The police officer who put his knee on George Floyds neck and the police officers who stood by and watched didnt just murder George Floyd they stole him. They stole him from his family and his friends his church and his community and from his own future.  The murder of George Floyd was the result of inhumane police brutality that is perpetuated by a culture of white supremacy. What happened to George Floyd was not the result of a bad apple; it was the predictable consequence of a racist and prejudiced system and culture that has treated Black bodies as the enemy from the beginning. What happened to George Floyd in Minneapolis is the fruit borne of toxic seeds planted on the shores of our country in Jamestown in 1619 when the first enslaved men and women arrived on this continent. Floyd is the latest in a long list of names that stretches back to that time and that shore. Some of those names we know  Ahmaud Arbery Breonna Taylor Oscar Grant Eric Garner Trayvon Martin Michael Brown Emmett Till Martin Luther King Jr.  most we dont.  The officers who murdered George Floyd who stole him from those who loved him must be brought to justice. At the same time we must embark on the more complicated work of delivering justice for all the victims of state sponsored violence and racism.  Four years ago we publicly stated our support for the Black Lives Matter movement. Today we want to be even more clear about the urgent need to take concrete steps to dismantle white supremacy in all its forms. To do that we are calling for four things:  First we call upon President Trump elected officials and political parties to commit our nation to a formal process of healing and reconciliation. Instead of calling for the use of aggressive tactics on protestors the President must take the first step by disavowing white supremacists and nationalist groups that overtly support him and by not using his Twitter feed to promote and normalize their ideas and agendas. The world is watching Americas response.  Second we call upon the Congress to pass H.R. 40 legislation that would create a commission to study the effects of slavery and discrimination from 1619 to the present and recommend appropriate remedies. We cannot move forward together as a nation until we begin to grapple with the sins of our past. Slavery Jim Crow and segregation were systems of legalized and monetized white supremacy for which generations of Black and Brown people paid an immeasurable price. That cost must be acknowledged and the privilege that accrued to some at the expense of others must be reckoned with and redressed.  Third we support Floyds familys call to create a national task force that would draft bipartisan legislation aimed at ending racial violence and increasing police accountability. We cant continue to fund a criminal justice system that perpetuates mass incarceration while at the same time threatens the lives of a whole segment of the population.  And finally we call on the Department of Justice to reinvigorate its Civil Rights Division as a staunch defender of the rights of Black and Brown people. The DOJ must also reinstate policies rolled back under the Trump Administration such as consent decrees to curb police abuses.  Unless and until white America is willing to collectively acknowledge its privilege take responsibility for its past and the impact it has on the present and commit to creating a future steeped in justice the list of names that George Floyd has been added to will never end. We have to use this moment to accelerate our nation's long journey towards justice and a more perfect union,political,Facebook

"Class is in session. Stand. Pledge. Sit. Topic: Critical race theory.  I have had quite a few people messaging me to ask questions about what critical race theory (CRT) is. As you know I have been taking a bit of a break but I wanted to go ahead and research the topic so I could report back and actually have the facts.  What is critical race theory?  Critical race theory quite simply is the study of how racism is embedded in American laws and institutions. Specifically its core idea is that racism is a social construct that is not only the product of individuals and their own biases but it is also something that is embedded in legal systems and policies. It includes the study of political power social organization and language.  Where did race theory come from?  Critical race theory was a framework for legal analysis in the ladder part of the 1970s and into the early part of the 1980s created by legal scholars Derrick Bell Kimberle (yes with an e) Crenshaw and Richard Delgado.  In the early 1980s students of color at Harvard Law School organized protests regarding Harvard's lack of racial diversity in the curriculum among students and in the faculty. These students supported Professor Derrick Bell who left Harvard Law in 1980 and then became the dean at University of Oregon School of Law. During his time at Harvard Bell had developed new courses that studied American law through a racial lens. Harvard students of color wanted faculty of color to teach the new courses in his absence. Bell resigned his position at Harvard because of what he viewed as the university's discriminatory practices.  Can you give me an example?  Sure. In the 1930s for instance government officials literally drew lines around certain areas deemed to be poor financial ricks most often specifically for the racial composition of its inhabitants. Banks would often times refuse to offer mortgages to the African Americans in these areas. Today these policies still exist via policies like single family zoning that prevents the building of affordable housing in advantages neighborhoods that majority white.  This academic understanding of critical race theory differs from representation in recent popular books and especially from its portrayal by criticsoften though not exclusively conservative Republicans. Critics charge that the theory leads to negative dynamics such as a focus on group identity over universal shared traits; divides people into oppressed and oppressor groups; and urges intolerance (Sawchuk 2021).  Give me another example.  Absolutely! Take the landmark case Brown v. Board of Education for example in which the Supreme Court ruled in 1954 that separate is not equal and that state laws protecting segregated public schools are unconstitutional. While the ruling gave Black children the right to attend schools that had long prohibited them it also resulted in some white families enrolling their children in private schools moving to the suburbs or redrawing school district boundaries in an effort to resist integration.  What does this have to do with our schools?  Scholars who study CRT in education examine how policies and practices in K-12 education are a contributor to persistent racial inequalities in matters such as education and advocate ways to change them. Topics of study include racially segregated schools underfunding of majority black and latino school districts barriers to gifted programs and selective admission high schools. Many educators support culturally relevant teaching and other strategies to make schools feel safe and supporting for African American students and other underserved populations. However these educators do not necessarily identify these activities as CRT related.  Critical race theory is NOT taught in K-12 schools instead it is taught in law schools.  Can you just lay it on the table for me?  Sure. A recent poll by the advocacy group Parents Defending Education claimed some schools were teaching that white people are inherently privileged while Black and other people of color are inherently oppressed and victimized; that achieving racial justice and equality between racial groups requires discriminating against people based on their whiteness; and that the United States was founded on racism. Thus much of the current debate appears to spring not from the academic texts but from fear among critics that studentsespecially white studentswill be exposed to supposedly damaging or self-demoralizing ideas.  Why Are People Talking About Critical Race Theory and the 1619 Project Right Now?  The term critical race theory began gaining traction in the mainstream two years ago  or notoriety depending on people's outlook  after The New York Times published the 1619 Project a compilation of essays commentaries and poems that brought the idea of critical race theory out of academia for the first time by asking readers to center the consequences of slavery and the contributions of Black Americans in the country's national narrative.  The project's orchestrator Nikole Hannah-Jones won a Pulitzer Prize for the moving personal essay she wrote  the introduction to the package  about her father a veteran and why he flew an American flag in their front yard and was proud to be American when what she saw as a little girl was a country that used and then abandoned him.  While the project was widely hailed it also irked many people who argued that it put ideology before historical accuracy as well as a handful of prominent academic scholars who challenged some of the package's guiding principles including that colonists fought the Revolutionary War in order to preserve slavery and that slavery was a uniquely American enterprise.  Political conservatives in particular found the darker portrayal of America's origins and its shortcomings galling saying that it undercut patriotism and had a divisive effect. Former President Donald Trump found it especially insulting. ""Critical race theory the 1619 Project and the crusade against American history is toxic propaganda ideological poison that if not removed will dissolve the civic bonds that tie us together will destroy our country"" he said about it at the time. Months following the 1619 Project's publication Trump convened the ""1776 Commission"" to counter the narrative and develop a ""patriotic"" curriculum that schools can use to teach U.S. history. The commission published a 41-page report two days before the end of the Trump administration which concluded among other things that progressivism is at odds with American values and recommended that schools teach positive stories about the country's founders (Camera 2021).  I heard this is something called a wedge issue. What is that?  A wedge issue is a political or social issue often of a controversial or divisive nature which splits apart a demographic or population group. Wedge issues can be advertised or publicly aired in an attempt to strengthen the unity of a population with the goal of enticing polarized individuals to give support to an opponent or to withdraw their support entirely out of disillusionment. The use of wedge issues gives rise to wedge politics. Wedge issues are also known as hot button or third rail issues.  Who came up with this?  This issue has been developed primarily by a man named Christopher Rufo. Rufo is an American conservative activist and the director of several documentary films. ... He is known for his activism against CRT which he says ""has pervaded every aspect of the federal government"" poses ""an existential threat to the United States"" and is anti-American.  Why is he making such an issue out of this?  Because it is divisive. Rufo says the goal is to have the public read something crazy in the newspaper and immediately think critical race theory. We have to codify the term and reccodify it to annex the entire range of cultural constructions that are unpopular with America. We will eventually turn it toxic as we put all of the various cultural under that brand category.  That is what this is all about ladies and gentleman.  EXTRA CREDIT  FACT: Stephen Bannon thinks the GOP could gain 50 House seats if they focus on critical race theory.  Class dismissed.",political,Facebook

Warning this is a sarcastic post.  I am seeing political ads by Andy Barr that are nonstop attack ads on Josh Hicks and his Liberal ideas without any ads proudly touting his policies.  Here is my idea for an attack ad that Andy Barr could run against Josh Hicks that would also demonstrate his 8 year commitment to Repealing and Replacing the Affordable Care Act/Obamacare:  ( The background pictures could show office doors being slammed shut in Kentucky as each topic is covered. They could be labeled: Protection Against Preexisting Conditions-Closed  PreNatal Care And Free Birth Control - Closed  Mental Health Counseling Access-Closed And Substance Abuse Counseling Access-Closed )  Josh Hicks supports Obamacare and wants to improve on it. He has flat out said it!  In contrast I Andy Barr have enthusiastically voted to repeal Obamacare. I have been proudly working to end ACA/Obamacare since I took office in 2012. The bill to gut Obamacare was the Republican AHCA. The Republican American Health Care Act of 2017 or proudly called Trumpcare.  Just After my Town Hall at Lafayette High School in April 2017 (the last Public one Ive had because I really dont like meeting with Constituents) I voted for the AHCA to Gut Obamacare. Just after my Enthusiastic vote to gut Obamacare the Congressional Budget Office issued its report saying 23 million Americans would lose healthcare coverage. That meant roughly 330000 Kentuckians or 48000 in My 6th District. That bill would have succeeded in the Senate except for Late Senator John McCain giving it the thumbs down. But lets review what this bill would have done to America.  I Andy Barr with that vote enthusiastically voted to remove protections against Preexisting Conditions that Obamacare enforced for all of us Americans.  I Andy Barr with that vote enthusiastically voted for the Insurance Companies whose PACs donate huge amounts to my campaigns.  I Andy Barr with that vote enthusiastically voted to eliminate free birth control one of Obamacares 10 Basic Health Essentials and the very best way to prevent elective abortions by preventing unplanned pregnancies.  I Andy Barr with that vote enthusiastically voted to take Away control over their bodies from many Middle Class Working Poor And Marginalized girls and women who cant afford birth control. I Andy Barr did that Enthusiastically. The side effect to my Enthusiastic vote will be for more girls and women to seek abortions because I Enthusiastically voted to take away free birth control.  I Andy Barr with that vote that would have eliminated the 10 Basic Health Essentials enthusiastically voted to reduce programs against the Opioid Epidemic. That vote by eliminating 10 Basic Health Essentials would have eliminated access to mental health and substance abuse counseling. Meaning that I Andy Barr with that vote Enthusiastically voted to increase Opioid Addiction by taking away the tools to fight it.  I Andy Barr approve this message because by Enthusiastically Repealing Obamacare I was glad to kick 23 million people off Healthcare including 330000 Kentuckians and 48000 from our 6th District. And we all know because Josh Hicks is Too Liberal for Kentucky he will keep Obamacare and improve it!  (Closing picture shows all Doors closing at once.)  Full disclosure I Chuck Eddy Lifelong Moderate Republican proudly support Democrat Josh Hicks because Trumpian Republican Andy Barr and his voting record are bad for Kentucky.  Aaaaaand how would you like to be without Healthcare during Covid19? Aaaaaand for all of you people that lost Healthcare when you lost your Employer Health Insurance dont forget that Andy Barr has his orporare Donor$ Back$ but not yours. Please vote accordingly.  P.S. Josh Hicks is a Veteran of both our military (Marine) and law enforcement. During that time Andy Barr was a Veteran Of Corporate Donors Fundraiser Dinners.  P.P.S. Dont forget that Andy Barr was SILENT at the same time Donald Trump was ignoring lying and Downplaying the Covid19 Pandemic. Trumps and Barrs pitiful ineffective inadequate and very slow response to Covid19 has now infected over 7299080 Americans as of today including Donald and Melania Trump. Trumps and Barrs pitiful ineffective inadequate and very slow response to Covid19 has now caused the deaths of 208191 Americans due to Covid19.  #VoteJoshHicksForCongress #RepealAndReplaceAndyBarr,political,Facebook

Manigault Newman a former Apprentice contestant and Trump aide who announced her resignation in December 2017 citing concerns with the administration suggests in Unhinged that there are recordings of Trump using the N-word.  515.  August 21 2018  The Trump administration announced plans to cut back Obamas coal emissions standards for coal-fired power plants calling them overly prescriptive and burdensome. The Trump plan increased the state authority to make decisions on coal emission standards saying it empowers states promotes energy independence and facilitates economic growth and job creation.  516.  August 21 2018  Donald Trumps former campaign manager Paul Manafort was convicted of five counts of tax fraud two counts of bank fraud and one count of failure to disclose a foreign bank account. The trial focused on the millions of dollars Manafort made advising a political party in Ukraine that backed pro-Russia policies and his sumptuous lifestyle including his $15000 ostrich-skin jacket and $1500 dress shirts and the meticulously landscaped flower bed in the shape of a giant M at his 10-bedroom Hamptons estate in New York.  517.  August 21 2018  On the same day Manafort was convicted Donald Trumps former lawyer Michael Cohen plead guilty in a federal court in New York to among other charges campaign finance violations for paying hush money to women who claimed to have had affairs with Trump. The following day Trump tweeted If anyone is looking for a good lawyer I would strongly suggest that you dont retain the services of Michael Cohen!  518.

August 30 2018  Despite his boasts of the countrys economic strength Donald Trump announced the government was canceling an automatic 2.1 percent pay increase for federal workers scheduled for Jan. 1 citing budget constraints. Senator Chris Coons (D-Delaware) stated It is unacceptable that after last year signing a Republican tax bill that gave away tens of billions in corporate tax cuts and added more than $1 trillion to the national debt President Trump cites the need for government belt-tightening in his decision to slash a planned pay increase.  522.  August 30 2018  During a speech in Evansville Indiana Donald Trump alleged that TV cameras were faking technical difficulties to deny him coverage.

The Left likes to attack fossil fuels with false statements. It started in the 1970s with foolish scare tactics that we were running out of oil. To the contrary oil and gas is still one of the cheapest and most widespread forms of energy available namely due to American ingenuity and the policies of the Trump Administration. We as a nation are an exporter of oil a fact which still seems to be inconceivable to those who oppose sound energy policy.  But facts do not seem to matter to the Left. Neither the enormous availability of fossil fuels nor the fact that oil and gas produces good-paying jobs nor the fact that oil and gas is necessary to our functioning as a society seem to matter. It is time to stand up to the harmful measures this Administration plans to implement and say NO to their efforts to take us backwards.,political,Facebook
Tax laws wage disparity and a host of other reasons make it difficult to determine what the average American pays each year in federal taxes but experts tend to figure the amount at $10500. So when the government refuses to disclose the distribution of $511 billion in CARES Act corporate aid one way to look at that is that the taxes of 50 million Americans disappeared into a black hole.  In February 2013 43 Republican Senators stonewalled then-President Obamas nominee for director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau because the agency lacked accountability and transparency. In a letter to Obama they wrote: We have serious concerns about the lack of congressional oversight of the agency and the lack of normal democratic checks on its sole director.  Yet when half a trillion dollars goes unaccounted for Republican Senators have not demanded the same accountability and transparency. They have not written a letter to Trump demanding the oversight  oversight which the House of Representatives demanded for the CARES Act which the Administration agreed to and which the Administration reneged on.  At the time of the 2013 letter to Obama Senator Jerry Moran (R-Kan) said Allowing a single unelected official to define their own jurisdiction and regulate vast segments of our economy without accountability or restraint is irresponsible regardless of political party. The American people agree wholeheartedly. Secretary Mnuchin is a single unelected official who has defined his own jurisdiction and regulated vast segments of the economy without accountability or restraint.  Senate Republicans clearly have a different yardstick of accountability and transparency when the administration is a Republican one. By not demanding that all government offices adhere to strict fiscal disclosures Republican senators have made our cherished two-party system a two-faced system instead.,political,Facebook
Friends In response to my opponent holding a rally with the trump campaign and knocking on doors (apparently without masks) to solicit voters today Ive received many messages asking about my campaigns position on door knocking.  My campaign will NOT be doing door knocking solicitations for the foreseeable future - and likely not at all for the duration of this campaign.  I'm going to miss talking to all my constituents face to face more than anything this campaign season - But its the right call to protect my constituents.

Republicans are raising hell because 13 members of Congress in their party voted for the infrastructure package. They tried through out Trumps presidency to get an infrastructure bill through Congress and were unsuccessful. In August 18 Republican Senators voted to move this bipartisan bill forward. Of course like any bipartisan bill there is always parts of it either party will complain about but that is what a compromise looks like. The Independence Party supports the Federal government spending money on infrastructure that is sorely needed and creates a foundation for our country to thrive upon. We do not however like the fact that a large portion of this bill is being paid for with borrowed money. Unfortunately that is the one thing both parties I like to call them Republicrats always seem to be able to agree upon. As far as the GOP members complaining about their fellow Republicans supporting something they have been trying to get done just shows how they will always put their part before country. I also include the radical far left Progressives who also held this bill up for months in the category of party before country. All of this points to the need for a third party with centrists beliefs.,political,Facebook

Friends youve heard about the news from Kabul. Two suicide bomb attacks killed thirteen U.S. service members and wounded eighteen other troops. At least 90 Afghans were killed.  Yesterday was the deadliest single day for the U.S. military in Afghanistan in a decade.  Our hearts ache for the loss of life and the broken families left behind. It hurts all the more that this atrocity was avoidable.  I said in April that President Biden was committing a grave error in extending the May 1 withdrawal date negotiated by President Trump. I said that if any additional American soldiers died between May 1 and September 11 the responsibility would fall squarely on Joe Bidens shoulders.  It has happened.  The last American should have departed by May before the start of the fighting season. Instead thousands have been put in harms way to suit Joe Bidens needlessly extended timetable.  Its a failure of leadership.  Luckily our truce with the Taliban negotiated by President Trump has held as we evacuate the remaining Americans in-country. The attacks were committed by an ISIS affiliate who is also an enemy to the Taliban.  The most important thing moving forward that we must remember is that nothing has changed. Afghanistan is no more critical to U.S. national security than it was one week ago. We are right to leave. A withdrawalno matter how poorly managedis preferential to continuing a war without purpose.  Do not allow a terrorist attack to dictate U.S. foreign policy.  Some peopleboth Republicans and Democratswant to reinvade the whole country. Not only would this be a strategic mistake but the attacks we saw yesterday would become a daily occurrence. Most Americans agree the costs are not worth another decade of war and occupation.  We pray that those thirteen lives are the last ones to be needlessly sacrificed in Afghanistan. Let us continue to bring our troops home safe and whole.  God bless.  -Sgt. Dan McKnight Chairman BringOurTroopsHome.US,political,Facebook

Mental Health care in the United States: ====================== The first thing I wish to note is the use of statistics. Both conservative and liberal has utilized statistics to foster and/or foment a particular idea belief or concept. To fully quantify this argument I wish to cite Benjamin Disraeli (former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom) there are three kinds of lies: Lies damn lies and statistics. I am always skeptical of statistical tabulation and the use of statistical values without appropriate citations. NOW to the point of our initial contact and conversation (mental health). We can go much further back to Sigmund Freud as well as the combat operations of World War I that catapulted our world violently and directly into the mental health world. But this is a very very long story  just about this time frame. Cutting to the chase. Why is our mental health care system so badly damaged? First the stigma of mental health. Many psychologists have found that men are less willing to seek mental health assistance. Women on the other hand are far more willing to seek mental health assistance. Both sexes increase their willingness to seek mental health assistance if they have sought out higher levels of education. But men are still far less likely. The other problem we must acknowledge is the lack of information knowledge and techniques to assist people with mental health issues. We must remember that Sigmund Freud did not truly begin his techniques of psychoanalysis concepts until 1885.  1918 end of World War I we were not even remotely competent in helping the severely mentally damaged from combat environments. 1945 end of World War II we were again still not competent in assisting combat veterans with severe mental issues. 1975 end of the Vietnam conflict AGAIN we had nothing. Veterans Administration (VA) hospitals State and Federal run mental health institutions etc. were bastions of filth. The only individuals who could find clean decent and helpful health care (physical mental etc.) were those with money. Now there were reasonable assistive elements in the VA and State and Federal run institutions. How can I say this? The VA is exceptionally well known for having doctors who have developed incredibly innovative techniques and procedures for decades. And State and Federal mental health institutions always provided relevant assistance to those seeking help. State and Federal mental health institutions always attempted to assist their patients/clients.  - DISCLAIMER: There are some egregiously notorious locations that have done abusive things to their patients/clients.  With that being said President Jimmy Carter began a comprehensive evaluation of the mental health care system. He put together a massive team to completely revamp retool and progressively fund all State and Federal mental health facilities throughout the United States. This includes the newly created entity within the Veterans Administration called the Vet Center.  QUICK NOTE: As noted above Vietnam veterans were not different in the lack of treatment and care not given in previous wars and conflicts. What became different was the change in deliverance reception transmission and rapidity of information processing.  Previously no one talked. Previous combat veterans drank themselves to death institutionalized as incredibly psychotic became a violent criminal and many other not nice and definitely not good conclusions. Now because of President Jimmy Carter and his comprehensive evaluation not only did veterans get a powerful new concept to dramatically effectively and exponentially increase their privacy but the entire country gained a massively newly renovated mental health system to directly help everyone.  BUT. And this is a BIG BUT.  This legislation was enacted/signed into law on 07 October 1980. Ronald Reagan wins the Presidential election 04 November 1980. Reagan is sworn in as President on 20 January 1981. Reagan nullifies the Mental Health Systems Act (MHSA) on 31 August 1981. Now Reagan did not nullify the entire act. The Vet Center system remained intact. But the most critical parts were completely destroyed. Reagan dismissively provided a singular point of funding through the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981. But the damage was done. Over the next few decades the majority of State and Federal mental health institutions shuddered.  With the massive loss of so many socialist funded mental health providers we as a population could only find mental health care through two methods: - Criminal incarceration. - Wealthy enough to afford it.  The next time anyone tried to re-start what President Carter tried to do was via First Lady Hillary Clinton (now Secretary Clinton). Her attempts were aggressively destroyed by partisan diatribes about Founding Fathers wanting a smaller government. - NOTE: This is an absolute falsehood created by white nationalists (I can prove it.). So we eventually had to wait till President Obama took office before we could legislate AGAIN a comprehensive revamping of our entire health care system. But this again was derided as a BIG government concept.  - FUTURE NOTE: If we had Medicare-For-All right now we could have slightly reduced tens of thousands of deaths from viral infections like CoVid-19.  REMEMBER: People like Sarah Palin screamed about Death Panels. REMEMBER: As recent as a month ago Lieutenant Governor of Texas said we should just let our elderly just die for our country. Not exactly a humane or Christian concept. POINT OF ORDER: Up until Reagan Democrats and Republicans could pretty much work together. It was not till Reagan orated his 11th Commandment that drove a massive stake right through their ability to find common ground.  The 11th Commandment was as such Thou shalt not speak ill of another Republican. Originally this was a self-serving concept. Reagan was being torn apart of fellow Republicans during his bid to win the Governorship in California. He eventually began to use it very often and actively used it during his tenor as the President. Ultimately the 11th Commandment became engrained deeply into Republicans so much so that it was literally a sin to speak ill of a fellow Republican.  Ponder that for a few moments. A Republican could say the vilest most disgusting and even incredibly criminal concepts and NO Republican was/is allowed to speak ill of them. Senator John McCain spoke against Trump. All Republicans have aggressively vilified an incredibly courageous and honorable veteran in direct support of Trump. Senator Mitt Romney spoke against Trump. All Republicans are aggressively vilifying Romney at every turn  or staying completely silent.  One last point HEALTH CARE FOR ALL. Period.

I want you to imagine this situation. With what happened in capitol the other day and with the kind of issues now in the media on the Trump administration the many laws being broken everyday and then the notion that Christians and Christian leaders and prophets are standing behind him cheering him on. What if these acts begin to prove to the government and the rest of the world that Christianity is the cause of such anarchy? What if? Just what if.  If this happens could it lead them to begin to find a way to ban Christianity because of the intolerance they see us exhibiting and the discrimination meted out to non-believers?  If this happens would we be the ones arming them with what they need to begin to shut Christianity down as stated in the Bible? Maybe the Antichrist would then arise in order to unite the people because of what the world thinks we are doingthat we arent peaceful and loving people.  So instead of being part of the problem I stand with Christ who said Love each other and in so doing prove that you are my disciples. He also said Love your enemies. 1 Peter 2:12 says Be careful to live properly among your unbelieving neighbors. Here he didnt say to overthrow your unbelieving neighbors. He said live properly among them.  In 1 Peter 3:15-16 he explained this by saying Instead you must worship Christ as Lord of your life. And if someone asks about your hope as a believer always be ready to explain it. But do this in a gentle and respectful way. Keep your conscience clear. Then if people speak against you they will be ashamed when they see what a good life you live because you belong to Christ.  That verse says we should explain our hope in a gentle and respectful manner. We are supposed to live by example of love gentleness peace and holiness. But instead most Christians live worse than non-believers and yet we think its the law that would help them to accept Christianity when we ourselves cant even keep it? I personally dont think putting in a president or government that will enforce laws against abortion and gay is the answer. In fact Im starting to think that all the antiChrist has to do is just say Im pro-life and anti gay and he would have the vote of the Christian leaders who would disregard everything else. Remember Jesus said that if possible they will be deceived. So we need to be a little bit more spiritual.  My dear friends 2020 was a year of pruning. I pray we have been pruned. I also pray we will not aid in making Christianity the mockery of the crowd. Let us first take out the log in our own eyes.,political,Facebook
So Trump gets accused in a fake Russian dossier that had no evidence & was attacked nightly for 3 years by the main stream media how they had evidence. And then they tried to impeach him for a phone call. Now Bidens son has a laptop that is worked on with incriminating evidence on it.

"A CONSPIRACY THEORY D This is part of a series I have been writing on the subject there is much more I am still writing and will post some links in the comments Democrat or Republican we all need to open our our eyes.  Let's try this again. I am afraid to say what is in mind  not really afraid to say it but I fear where we are and where we are going and the future unless we stop and come to our senses quick looks scary.  We have an old tradition in this countrywhen we want to bring freedom and democracy to a foreign land we do one of two things we invade the country topple the regime and find some sellouts to replace the local government or we send arms to some disgruntled faction or two or three to start a civil war let their people destroy the country and we help whoever is the biggest traitor that will sell out the country to us.  The fact is that in a civil war there are no winning sides whoever comes up on top ( a civil war can last generations even) has to make a deal with an outsider or some super rich entity (ies) to maintain power and to establish controls. The super rich are not affected by the war itself in most inst6they may just go outside the war area ( even overseas) and come back later to assume power or control rebuilding effort and thus profit. In modern times the foriegn investment is stopped jobs and industries are lost poverty and misery spreads in all directions and for all sides.  If an entity or a power wanted to destroy the United States of course starting a civil war here would be the best way to destroy the nation its power and economy also. Let us assume that their is a ""cabal"" that is bent on destroying the country and taking control to destroy democracy and and set up autocratic regime todaybwould a good day since we are ready and willing to do it to ourselves. And how convenient if that power was to control parts of the government and the political apparatus already.  The two sides in the country today left and the right are willing to do it the right apparently thinks they have more guns so they will have the upper hand as most of the police and much of the military has already been brainwashed by their side and will be willing to kill for their purpose. They have been convinced that they are on the right side of history and they are sure to win the power. Of course the powers that be  the ones that are aiming to destroy democracy and and ruin the country have already a leader in place to do their bidding to call his followers to arms and to do the dirty work of encouraging civil strife.  More to follow  M. N. R.  12 OCTOBER 2020  CRISIS  An incident or an occasion that causes and brings about a lasting change in a person or even a society. That change once again depends upon the knowledge and the reasoning ability of the person or the society as a whole. The reasoning ability here depends upon education and also upon upbringing nature and nurture as they say. The same instant that will cause one to get motivated and work hard and get an education or such to get ahead could cause another to rob a store join a gang become a hooker or even join a church.  M. N. R.  12 OCTOBER 2020  VICTIMS  Once one has reached majority and claims maturity all choices are deliberate and all consequences always predicted.  If a baby is molested or a child is abused they have no control over the situation but when a person of age abuses alcohol or drugs drives drunk robs or kills drops out of school and has babies they can't afford they are not victims they know what they are doing and should be held responsible.  M. N. R.  That the democracy and the country itself is facing ruin regardless of who wins on the 3rd of November while both sides bicker about the supreme court nomination or the COVID-19 crisis we have bigger issues that need immediate attention. But we have been deliberately mislead. The plan is being worked by both sides to keep the population occupied with trash. I had warned about the militia plans and the infiltration of police and the military. I have written about the BLM and their misguided focus on the police brutality only. If there is a conspiracy it is about keeping the population confused and at each other's throat instead of solving problems. I wrote back in February how COVID-19 will impact everything we know about life from work to education and food  no one is talking about the new realities not in a major way and the public still has no idea what the new world will look like in a couple of years.  While a low level civil war or at least unrest is a real possibility regardless of who wins #republican side is not even trying to promote calm and peace. We will all pay for it. If Trump wins and igive him an 80% chance his followers may go to ""weapons free"" anyway.  Is it the conspiracy of the elite to start a civil war and destroy the democracy and install an autocratic regime. If I were betting I'd say that this the plan. A conspiracy right in your face and you are a willing participant. Only you lose is by winning. I am by no means done here do come back there is a lot more to this  M. N.

"THIS IS PRECISELY WHY WE MUST NEVER ASSUME WORK EVERY DAY-IN MANY WAYS AND TURN OUT EVERY BLUE VOTE!  ""TRUMP-BIDEN RACE IS MUCH CLOSER THAN YOU THINK!  By Doug Schoen | Fox News  Former Vice-President Joe Biden appears to be in a better position to win the November presidential election than ever before with a number of recently released polls showing him with a significant lead over President Trump.  But despite a clear polling advantage for the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee there are two key factors that have resulted in many public polls obtaining results that overstate Bidens actual lead.  The first factor is that some polls use disproportionately Democratic samples.  For example we can look to CNNs general election poll released this week which shows Biden beating Trump nationally by a 14-point margin  55 percent to 41 percent.  Although Biden holds a national advantage over Trump according to all recent public polling the CNN poll inflates Bidens margin of victory by having a disproportionately Democratic registered voter sample.  With 32 percent of people surveyed identifying as Democrats  compared to 25 percent identifying as Republicans  this 7-point Democratic margin does not represent actual voter turnout on Election Day.  Indeed according to CNNs 2016 national exit polling data the actual margin of voters identifying as Democrats compared to those identifying as Republicans favored Democrats by 3 points  36 percent to 33 percent.  Further an Emerson College poll of registered voters conducted at the same time still shows Biden ahead but with his lead cut by more than half  to just 6 points. Accordingly this poll used a sample that is more representative of turnout by party with Democrats comprising 35.6 percent of the sample while Republicans accounted for 32.5 percent.  These figures more closely align with party data from 2016 exit polls leading me to believe that Bidens actual lead is likely closer to 6 points rather than 14 points.  However there is a second factor that also should give us pause before relying on presidential polling: whether the poll is of registered voters as opposed to likely voters.  Both the aforementioned CNN and Emerson College general election polls use registered voters. Although the Emerson poll was more accurately representative in terms of party identification polling registered voters has historically overrated Democrats.  Polls of likely voters have been known in recent decades to be a much more reliable predictor of election results than polls of registered voters.  From 1990 to 2014 polls of likely voters showed virtually no bias towards either party and were largely in line with the ultimate results of the election. In contrast polls of registered voters showed a median Democratic bias of 2 points according to FiveThirtyEight.  Furthermore according to the same FiveThirtyEight analysis between 1990 and 2014 there has been a nearly 2-point margin favoring Republican turnout in presidential election years. Thus polls of registered voters would inherently have a Democratic bias given that more Republicans turn out to vote.  Additionally public polls fail to factor in the clear enthusiasm gap between Democrats and Republicans. This was evident in Georgia where turnout in the Republican primary for Trump substantially exceeded the combined vote for Biden and Sanders on the Democratic side. This has been reflected in most national polling done this year to the advantage of Trump and his fellow Republicans.  Though these factors contribute to exaggerating Bidens lead the former vice president still has a clear advantage meaning it will be an uphill battle for Trump to win reelection.  The president faces clear vulnerabilities in terms of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic as well as his recent actions relating to the current civil unrest following the death of George Floyd  a black man in handcuffs who wasnt resisting arrest  at the hands of Minneapolis police.  And some prominent members of Trumps own party and retired military officers have recently denounced him for some of his comments and actions.  While Trump faces clear electoral issues among critical voter blocs  independent voters suburban white voters and older voters  Biden also has cause for concern that goes beyond his overstated public polling lead.  According to an analysis of recent polling released this week by The New York Times in the past few weeks Biden has failed to make inroads with non-white voters. Thats a crucial voter bloc that the Democrats will need to turn out in order to be successful in November.  Indeed the analysis shows that Biden currently has a 46-point lead among non-white voters which is less than Hillary Clintons 50-point advantage among these voters in the final polls of 2016.  Furthermore despite the fact that Trump has lost ground with suburban white moderate voters independents and older voters  three critically important groups for both parties this year Biden may find himself in an increasingly problematic situation as he tries to court these voters.  Given the credible threat of Democrats moving too far left with policy initiatives such as defunding the police  which many prominent Democrats have called for in recent weeks  Biden may have a much more difficult time cutting into Trumps margin with these voters than public polling may make it seem now.  Further if history is any guide we can expect that some moderate Republicans and Republican-leading independents will return to the fold  to come home as is said in politics.  This is especially likely if Trump is able to convincingly make the case that he successfully dealt with the fallout from the pandemic and put our economy on the path to recovery come November.  Ultimately taken together aspects of public polling that exaggerate Bidens lead combined with the challenges that both he and Trump currently face will make the result of the election much closer than it currently appears it will be.

"My name is Amy Washburn and I'm running for Congress as a Democrat in 2022. My opponent the Republican incumbent is this guy who voted against COVID aid three times & impeachment twice; who thinks it should be okay to pay disabled workers less than the minimum wage; and who thinks that taking vitamin D works better to prevent COVID than the vaccines.  In March this guy claimed tax credits in the new COVID relief bill were ""anti-marriage"" and that it was all the fault of the Black Lives Matter movement. The hat he wore during the interview is the least of the problems here. Click the link below to watch the video:   In April this guy sent email to constituents in which he opposed DC statehood for a number of specious reasons the inaccuracy of which I detailed in a Twitter thread - click here to read the thread:   This guy also sent email to constituents stating that he introduced a House Resolution to recognize the significant role vitamin D may play in the fight against COVID-19 & that studies show a strong correlation between vitamin D deficiencies & negative COVID-19 patient outcomes including severe symptoms hospital stays ICU admittance and overall mortality rate. In fact a correlation has been shown by some studies but not others. The article linked below says its too soon to tell if Vitamin D can help to prevent COVID: there's no firm evidence that vitamin D supplements curb people's risk of infection or serious Covid-19 illness.   This guy explained his vote against the HEROES Act by saying that the bill strips states of their right to administer elections a claim Politifact rated as false.   This guy *chewed on his pen* while on camera during a COVID committee meeting! Again see for yourself:  This guy is trying to block Green Card Holders from getting federal help claiming that President Bidens plan to get up to 11M illegal immigrants on a path to citizenship will ""prompt 'many' to 'use their new legal status to apply for additional welfare benefits and not work.'""   Many Green Card Holders got that status by marrying US citizens. Many have US citizen children. None of them are here illegally. This guys bill were it to become law would block even those Green Card Holders from receiving federal help of any kind. It should also be noted that actual illegal immigrants are already prohibited from receiving most welfare benefits except for WIC & a few emergency relief programs.  This guy doesnt want to give back pay to all federal employees both those who work and those who dont"" after government shutdowns implying that some federal employees somehow don't work.

Today we celebrate the last-minute reprieve extended to farm families living in the Klamath Basin!  The Department of Interior just announced based on recent rainfall and an adjustment to winter storage that it will provide all of the 140000 acre-feet of irrigation water it promised to farmers early this spring. Although this is only about one-third of the water normally available to farmers it is enough to finish growing at least some of the crops planted in reliance upon being supplied this modest amount of water.  For this incredibly important decision we must thank President Trump Congressman Walden Congressman LaMalfa Interior Secretary Bernhardt and the Klamath Basin people who advocated for farmers livelihoods at the Shut Down Fed Up rally. This most likely would not have happened without the thousands of voices that made themselves heard through letters interviews and showing up at the rally.  Since the very beginning of my campaign for congress I have been meeting with various stakeholders in the basin to seek an understanding of and ultimately a resolution to this decades old complex and extremely divisive issue.  In Congress this will be one of my top priorities. Even though I have much more to learn I am confident a permanent solution exists; it clearly is time to end uncertainty as to water in this basin.

They cannot fight MAGA or KAG.They cannot fault him for lack of ""ventilators"" and masks. They cannot say he is not close to having a vaccine for the virus. They can do one thing and one thing only. They can order the fake news and their operatives and their MSM corrupt allies and spinsters and activists and other hypocrite allies to falsely claim that the Covid is ""spiking"" and blame him for doing a terrible job in handling it. They can pretend as though if they were in charge nobody would have died. He acted sooner than all of them despite their criticism yet they say he killed two hundred thousand plus Americans.

Accountability and integrity are important. Recently Ive received some questions about a highly publicized grant our county received last year and Id like to set the record straight.         $.  ? YES! In 2019 Grant County was awarded $9.58 million in grants to replace 34 structurally deficient bridges in 2021. The project is one of only 20 nationwide awarded Competitive Highway Bridge Program (CHBP) and will be completed in partnership with the Oklahoma Department of Transportation.  The total cost is projected at $10.3 million with grant funds from the CHBP Grant at $3468000; matching funds from ODOT at $3361000 and the Oklahoma Circuit Engineering District 8 at $2751000. The Grant County Bridge & Road Improvement fund will contribute $720000.  You can read more about the grant program and verify this information on the U.S. Department of Transportation website:             ? Grant money from the Oklahoma Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration will NEVER be sent to the Grant County Treasurer  because these projects are bid and let by ODOT.               ? Grant County and ODOT are currently working to fast track this project and are actually AHEAD of schedule with plans to go out for bid letting as early as November 2020 with construction to begin in 2021.           ? NO! I worked in partnership with ODOT the Federal Highway Administration and the Trump Administration.  First I worked with Oklahoma Secretary of Transportation Mike Patterson to secure Grant County bridges in one of the states three applications for the CHBP grant. Next we dedicated a 45-day working period to help write the grant and solicit more than 140 letters of support. The grant was submitted in December 2018 and awarded in August 2019.  I am thankful our county had support for this project from SO MANY PEOPLE - from White House staff down to the 140 individuals who wrote letters of support!!  Our government works best when we work together  federal state and local. I believe that to get things done we need more than just concrete and steel beams we need to build bridges between the big and the small and the right and the left.,political,Facebook

If that seat remains open there will be nothing the democrats wont do in order to win the election. Mitch McConnell must do whatever needs to be done to get Trumps nominee confirmed.  Currently there are two women who appear to be the front-runners Amy Coney Barrett and Barbara Lagoa both Catholics. It matters not which one is selected either will be relentlessly attacked over her religion. Since the democrats cant accuse either of rape or train rapes they will try to discredit the nominee by tying her to comments said by others in her church. She will be said to be unworthy because of such associations. The nominee should not be subjected to the endless attacks on her religion especially since the Constitution states that there will be no religious tests for government office. Therefore the Senate should forgo the judiciary committee hearing if rules allow take it to the full Senate and get this thing done.,political,Facebook
Good morning everybody! As the deadline for Congressional re-districting closes in this page will be more active to educate our fans about projections to the House and Senate ratings for next years primaries. We know that Texas will have 40 electoral votes (yes FOURTY!) which means two new Congressional districts added to Texas. The seats we see flipping in TX based on Biden's approval rating and his handling of immigration issues are:  TX-15 (Central Hidalgo to Guadalupe county) TX-34 (Southeast Hidalgo to Dewitt county) TX-7 (West Houston and suburbs like River Oaks and Memorial) The GOP needs 4 seats to re-take the house and TX could be key.  Were going to begin talking about the Virginia and New Jersey Governors races. Can a Trump Republican in those states manage to lead a strong coalition to victory or will it take a more moderate candidate to reach across the aisle to connect enough voters? Also we will being running regression models according to Census models to predict voting behaviors and demographic changes. Stay tuned as we follow up with the news!!,political,Facebook
"MAKE ECUA GREAT AGAIN""???  MAKE ECUA GREAT AGAIN? My challenger has said that Board members and others at ECUA have become nonchalant about their duties. Because of that he says I should be replaced so that he may Make ECUA Great Again. How he is to accomplish this he does not say. He has offered no details; and if he should offer details he probably would be wrong in most of them because he has never participated in ECUA affairs. He sounds like the new guy on the job who intends to tell all the older workers how to do better. Make ECUA Great Again? I suggest that my challenger would not know where to start.  A man who suggests that he will make a local governmental body great may be a man who suffers from delusions of grandeur.  NO ""NONCHALANCE"" AT ECUA. But my main point here is that there is no nonchalance at ECUA. ECUA does not need my challenger to show it how to be an efficient effective governmental agency. ECUA as a whole is a progressive creative and responsible agency. I have worked hard for many years to make it so and I will continue working to make it better.  I do not claim that ECUA was ever great. I claim onlybut I do claim this that it is a good agency.  TEN RECENT ECUA ACCOMPLISHMENTS. Let me point out some of ECUAs accomplishments of recent years. Other accomplishments merit attention but I will restrict myself to ten. In reading of these judge for yourself whether nonchalance is an apt description of ECUA.  1. In 2009 ECUA bought out private Allied Waste and began providing sanitation service (garbage collection) north of Ten Mile Road. While imperfect ECUAs service has been greatly superior to that of Allied Waste as many residents of District 5 will remember. This was a major new responsibility.  2. In 2009 ECUA began collection of recyclable materials another major new responsibility. This was the first recycling program in Northwest Florida. (Note too that participation in ECUAs recycling program is voluntary as is the entire sanitation program north of Cantonment. In contrast Escambia County Alabama has a mandatory sanitation program does it not? And the City of Pensacola has a mandatory recycling program.)  3. ECUAs sanitation service is reasonably priced. The last time I checked ECUAs monthly charge was $4.50 LESS than the rate charged by the City of Pensacola.  4. Because ECUA is a soundly funded and service-minded agency we have performed yeoman-like service in times of crisis: a. Hurricane Ivan in 2004 b. Hurricane Dennis in 2005 c. Extreme rain event in 2014 (Hey Bristol Parkremember this?) d. Tornado at Century in 2016 (ECUA supplied equipment and manpower to Century to remove downed trees) e. Hurricane Michael in 2018 (ECUA supplied equipment expertise and 300 man-hours of labor to the City of Mexico Beach)  5. In 2010 the Central Water Reclamation Facility (CWRF) went on line months ahead of schedule and $30 million below budget. The CWRF is a $300 million hurricane-proof world-class wastewater treatment plant. It was and is an extraordinary achievement that many thought would never be possible.  6. In 2012 ECUA switched to a Sanitation Department truck fleet powered by compressed natural gas (CNG). Fuel costs are reduced by $1 million per year maintenance costs are less and trucks break down less often. ECUA today has the largest public fleet of CNG-powered vehicles in Florida.  7. In 2015 ECUA opened its Materials Recycling Facility (MRF) making recycling feasible both for us and for others in the region. Today the MRF is a regional service center serving ECUA and thirteen other agencies in three states. This is a major new responsibility.  8. In 2016 ECUA began producing mulch and compost both as a public service and as a major cost-saving achievement. Rather than pay to bury our yard-debris collection we now convert yard debris to mulch and compost all of which is either sold or given to the public. This is a major new responsibility.  9. In 2020 ECUA is carrying out the ninth year of a sixteen-year program to make large-scale repairs to its wastewater collection system which consists of pipes and lift stations fifty years or more old in some cases. This program is providing a major modernization of ECUAs underground infrastructure without excessive burden on ratepayers.  10. In 2021 ECUA will complete the construction required to supply all reclaimed wastewater on Pensacola Beach to use for irrigation purposes. The goal is to end completely the disposal of treated wastewater into Santa Rosa Sound. This will be a major new accomplishment.  CONCLUSION. So where is the nonchalance? My challenger says that he will Make ECUA Great Again. I offer three critiques of his theme:  1. It is a bit unoriginal.  2. It is an injustice to President Trump to use it for such a picayune purpose.  3. Most importantly it is wrong in its basic assumption. ECUA is not perfectno one knows that better than I dobut it has been doing a fine job overall.  Either my challenger just does not know what he is talking about or he is grabbing at straws for campaign fodder.  Keep Larry Walker Representing District 5",political,Facebook
To all who care about their Country and the state of affairs in the United States  I am a Retired Military Officer Commissioned from Infantry Officer Candidate Candidate School Class 509 Fort Benning Georgia in 1968. I served 23 years as a Commissioned Officer and retired from the Military in 1989 to pursue other opportunities in the civilian sector. Considering how our country is currently being led by an incompetent President I pledge to support this Country and my fellow Officers who join me in publicizing the present danger of our current President Donald J. Trump. I also invite other citizens of the United States to speak up and join our protest and demand that the current President and his regime step down from their positions. In this regard I strongly support my fellow Officers who have collectively penned the letter below. If you agree with our concerns I request you copy and re-post this letter to your family and friends across our Country.  R. Scott Swingler Lieutenant Colonel U.S. Army Retired  The Letter  VOICES OF CONCERN FOR OUR IMPERILED DEMOCRACY  We the undersigned are former or retired army officers now in our seventies. We share a common bond having graduated from the U.S. Army Officer Candidate School at Ft. Benning Georgia in 1968. From there we served in the military in a variety of capacities wherever we were needed. As young men we were committed to defending Americas values our freedoms our democracy and our Constitution. Some of us made a career in the military but most of us went on to have productive careers back home in the civilian world. As a group we have diverse political views: Republicans Democrats Liberals and Conservatives. But we are all concerned Americans.  In the past few months our system of government has been increasingly under siege. Our nation has reached this critical point under the current administration of Donald J. Trump. Important voices have begun to speak out led by respected members of the highest military rank. We would like to join this chorus of alarm.  Our government structure with its co-equal branches is in jeopardy. Our judicial system is reeling. The FBI the CIA and the NSA are being mocked and belittled. Our Attorney Generals office is overtly politicized. Our State Department is being decimated. Where are the voices of outrage in Congress? The Senate is virtually mute.  We are concerned that our country is rapidly spinning toward a Presidency staffed by family members and cronies in which the only prerequisite is blind loyalty. The United States is withdrawing from the world enjoying little respect internationally. This cannot continue.  Quoting James Mattis a Marine Four Star General and former Secretary of Defense:  We know that we are better than the abuse of executive authorityWe must reject and hold accountable those in office who would make a mockery of our Constitution.  We honor the Generals courage and emphatically call on both chambers of Congress to follow his lead in defending our democracy and our Constitution. We urge all Americans to consider these ideals as you vote this Fall.  John F. Baxter III (1LT USA) A.C. (Budd) Mazurek (1LT USA) Mark T. Creaven (1LT USA) John F. McMackin Jr. (1LT USA) Larry W.

June 2017  Two anonymous White House officials told the New York Times that Donald Trump said Haitians all have AIDS and Nigerian immigrants wouldnt ever go back to their huts. Newly released immigration statistics which reported 15000 Haitian immigrants had entered the U.S. since he took office reportedly ignited President Trumps tirade. While the White House subsequently denied Trump had used the words AIDS and huts it did not deny the overall description of the meeting.  271.  June 2017  The Trump International Hotel in Washington D.C. received $270000 in payments from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for rooms catering and parking as part of a lobbying effort. This violates the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution which forbids government officials from accepting any present Emolument Office or Title of any kind whatever from any King Prince or foreign State. Donald Trump has retained an ownership interest in his businesses and thus could receive payments from foreign states. 239.

Did you know? For those new to our club or its social media page-a brief history of what we DO. But first our story. In 2002 a handful of activists including Debby Kerner Sheila Blake and Alan Guttman got together and- tired of a red shaded community and county- formed Southwest Houston Democrats. Shortly after having found a need for a deeper community focus  they named it Meyerland Area Democrats with Meyerland Westbury Maplewood and Marilyn Estates. And so it began...  It grew as more and more joined and starting inviting speakers and learning how to do GOTV operations in these communities. Neighbor by neighbor grassroots activism at its finest rose. The club became known for being fierce fighters for progressives. A generation of leadership was trained in our club. The club has outgrown every space its occupied from Marco's to Escalante's to Fadi's and now Zoom/Facebook live.  Meyerland Area Democrats besides having stellar programming which has brought in the movers and shakers in the Democratic party from not just Houston but Texas and even nationally has contributed in key ways via its organizing.  Our members in the past 3 cycles alone have made some 75000 calls to voters knocked on the doors of over 25000 homes written 50000 postcards raised thousands for the Harris County Democratic Party the Texas Democratic Party Annie's List TOP and has given to numerous local party clubs.  We are proud to say that the communities we serve have had their voter turnout rise to the top 1 percentile in turnout countywide and our goal of turning these neighborhoods blue has succeeded. When President Pronin was sworn in for his 1st term in 2011 John Culberson was the congressman for much of our membership and community. Today it is Democrat Lizzie Fletcher. HD 134 voted Republican the entire ballot 10 years ago. Today HD134 is voting Democratic- by 30 points for Biden-and now has a Democratic State Rep. Ann Johnson.  Our new Democratic congresswoman Lizzie Fletcher-took her rise in the forum we hosted in January 2017. Many new activists post Trump's election came to our club to get connected- and grew networks into Swing Left and others who won the race. Without Meyerland Area Democrats having organized these communities for years such a victory would have been even more difficult.  Also to note-in 2015 our club was key in Mayor Turner's win- in a race won by 4000 votes. We even got an office from Turner in Westbury. We staged numerous canvass events created and funded mailers and much more. We were front and center in that key fight.  Some other highlights include hosting Beto O'Rourke twice the second townhall we did at Westbury High School with 1600 guests is the largest gathering of progressives in the history of Westbury! Other programming highlights include: James Carville Mayors Turner Parker and Lee Brown. We are also proud of tackling complex issues and pressing for conversations in the community- ie Black Lives Matter GLBT rights public education teachins on various issues . We have partnered with many of our county clubs including Swing Left HBAD ROAD Women TDW Harris Houston Young Stonewall Dems Harris County Young Democrats Bayou Blue Dems Bellaire-Braes Democrats  Sharpstown Democrats (and many more). Call us forum gurus- as our forums have set the standard for fairness and attendance.  To the thousands of you who have through our club over the years thank you. The work of our membership as it is in all our clubs is that of great personal sacrifice. 17 years in and our organization has become one which is seen as one of our state's premiere organizations for the party. We also happen to represent the largest number of Jewish American Democrats of any local club in the state!  See you soon (on Zoom)- Art Pronin President,political,Facebook
June 12 2020  this is long but of concern. GOP friends are you ok with this?  ICYMI: Kansas GOP to feature Vice President of Islamophobic Hate Group as Keynote Speaker in Dodge City event #KSSEN Candidates Roger Marshall Kris Kobach and Dave Lindstrom scheduled to attend  Topeka KS  The Dodge City Republican Expo organized by the Kansas Republican Partys First Congressional District will feature the Vice President of Understanding the Threat a noted anti-Islamic extremist hate group as its keynote speaker later this month. Scheduled guests include U.S. Senate candidates Roger Marshall Kris Kobach and Dave Lindstrom along with KS-01 candidates Bill Clifford and Tracey Mann.  Established by disgraced FBI agent John Guandolo the Dallas-based organization has been classified as an anti-muslim hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Understanding the Threat President John Guandolo has previously made headlines for religiously profiling a Southwest Airlines employee calling on Donald Trump to execute John Brennan Jim Comey and other government officials for treason and assaulting a Minnesota sheriff for questioning his discriminatory claims.  In response to the Kansas GOP featuring hateful inflammatory and Islamophobic rhetoric Kansas Democratic Party officials released the following statements:  KDP Chairwoman Vicki Hiatt: During a time when the nation is calling for institutional change the Kansas GOP is actively condoning inflammatory Islamophobic rhetoric by hosting a noted hate group at their Republican Expo. The latest from the Kansas GOP is unequivocally against the principles that hardworking Kansans represent and I call on the Kansas GOP and their candidates Roger Marshall Kris Kobach Dave Lindstrom Bill Clifford and Tracey Mann to condemn the Islamophobic rhetoric of Understanding the Threat and to pull out from this disgraceful event.  KDP Executive Director Ben Meers: This is sadly another clear demonstration of how out-of-touch the Kansas GOP is with hardworking Kansans. The rhetoric tied to the Islamophobic conspiracy group hosted by the Kansas GOP is categorically un-American. Kansan voters have rejected discrimination time and time again  when voters reach the ballot box on November 3rd they will remember where the GOP lands on issues of liberty and justice for all.  KDP First District Chairwoman Sage TeBeest: We hold our leaders to a higher standard in Western Kansas than associating themselves with and inviting an identified hate group to speak to our district. It is disturbing to learn Congressman Roger Marshall has chosen fearmongering and peddling in conspiracy theories instead of proposing solutions for farmers with no markets to sell their crops rural communities struggling and businesses reeling from COVID-19. We understand the path forward is by embracing our diverse district. Just as western Kansas was settled 120 years ago by immigrants looking for a better life for their families the same is true today. The future of rural Kansas is brightest when we embrace diversity.  Ford County Democratic Chair Johnny Dunlap: The hate-filled paranoid and dishonest rhetoric promoted by Understanding the Threat and its leadership has no place in Ford County or anywhere else across the free state of Kansas. It is completely and utterly disgraceful for the Kansas GOP and its Republican candidates to sanction the ignorant and Islamophobic positions of a noted hate group. The Ford County Chapter of the Kansas Democratic Party will continue to fight for justice and equality across Southwest Kansas.,political,Facebook
"The ""BIGLIEST"" crowd came to see Trump in Tulsa! Or did they! Must be fake news! Lol DA2020  By Kevin Liptak and Kaitlan Collins CNN Updated 7:13 AM EDT Sun June 21 2020  (CNN)By the time President Donald Trump was gliding in his helicopter toward Joint Base Andrews on Saturday destined for what he'd once hoped would be a triumphant packed-to-the-rafters return to the campaign trail things were already looking bad.  Scanning cable news coverage earlier in the day Trump was disappointed to see pictures not of massive lines forming outside the Bank of Oklahoma Center in Tulsa but of Geoffrey Berman the federal prosecutor Trump's attorney general had attempted unsuccessfully to dismiss the night before a person familiar with his response said.  Hours later the President was informed six campaign staffers in Tulsa had tested positive for coronavirus ahead of his scheduled arrival -- an unfortunate reminder of an ongoing pandemic Trump's critics say he is ignoring. After initially dismissing the revelation a source familiar with his reaction said Trump erupted when it was subsequently reported in the media -- overtaking coverage of the rally itself.  Still a determined Trump was intent on breathing new life into his staggering campaign. He took off for Tulsa convinced large swaths of his supporters would be waiting for him there.  Things did not improve once Air Force One lifted off. The President received a report that only about 25 people were assembled in the overflow space the campaign had reserved for a crowd Trump claimed five days earlier would top 40000.  Two hours before the rally was set to begin people who had signed up for tickets received an urgent text message from the Trump campaign: ""The Great American Comeback Celebration's almost here!"" it read. ""There's still space!""  When the President landed in Tulsa at 5:51 p.m. local time the crowds his aides had promised him had failed to materialize. Air Force One flew over the arena where Trump had been told thousands of supporters would be waiting to hear from him before he went inside but saw nothing resembling the sea of people he'd been expecting.  While he was in the air the campaign had canceled the outside appearance given the apparent lack of enthusiasm.  Once viewed inside the White House and Trump's campaign as a reset button for a presidency beset by crises and self-inflicted wounds Saturday evening's campaign rally in Tulsa instead became plagued with pitfalls a disappointing microcosm of the blindspots denial and wishful thinking that have come to guide the President as he enters one of the most precarious moments of his first term.  By the time he strode out to the strains of Lee Greenwood on Saturday evening into a partially-full Bank of Oklahoma Center the event had devolved from a triumphant return to the campaign trail after a 110-day pandemic-forced absence into something else altogether. The launch of a new assault on former Vice President Joe Biden fizzled replaced by recycled grievances and race-baiting. The sparse crowd was a reminder that many Americans even Trump's supporters remain cautious of a pandemic that continues to rage in places like Oklahoma where cases are spiking even if Trump is ready to move on.  Aides were anxiously awaiting his response to a less-than-stellar turnout aware he has threatened to fire officials in the past when his rallies ended in disappointment.  ""You are warriors. We had some very bad people outside. They were doing bad things. But I really do appreciate it"" Trump told his crowd appearing to explain away the empty seats as a result of ""thugs"" outside the arena even though CNN teams on the ground said they did not see violence or people blocking entrances.  After a nearly two-hour speech notable mainly for its discursiveness Trump left Tulsa on Saturday night having spent around three hours in the city. The six advance staffers who had tested positive for coronavirus remained in their chain hotel rooms quarantined for the foreseeable future.  From nearly the moment the word ""Tulsa"" slipped from Trump's mouth two Wednesdays ago things seemed to start going south.  First there was the problem with the rally's date which the President changed begrudgingly after learning it coincided with Juneteenth -- the holiday commemorating the end of slavery in the United States. The new slot he complained would draw fewer viewers.  Then there was the location which Trump did not view as a problem even though plenty of others around him were wary of riling a city with a violent racist history in the middle of a national racial reckoning.  The notion of packing supporters into a crowded arena amid a resurgence in coronavirus cases was always going to be an issue -- but half-a-dozen staffers on the advance team testing positive was a wrinkle Trump had not anticipated when he insisted a rally be placed on his schedule.  By the middle of May Trump had begun quizzing aides when he might be able to return to the campaign rallies that have long been one of the few aspects of being a politician he enjoys.  Confined to the White House for months amid a pandemic that had caused a once-hot economy to ice over Trump repeatedly asked that a rally be put on the calendar even as public health officials warned against large gatherings.  For weeks Trump's requests for a rally were put off or slow-walked with the health warnings as rationale. While the administration's top public health experts -- including Doctors Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx -- did not weigh in specifically on campaign rallies their views of resuming large gatherings were well known among Trump's staffers.  But as large protests began forming after the death of George Floyd the Black man who died after a White police officer knelt on his neck the arguments against convening a rally seemed harder to make -- particularly to the President who said if protesters could gather in large numbers than so could his supporters.  With Trump more intent than ever on returning to the trail his senior campaign team scrambled to identify a location that could both guarantee a large crowd and provide a cooperative governor and mayor who would allow a major gathering of people -- potentially indoors -- to proceed despite continued warnings against such events by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Tulsa appeared at first glance to fit the bill. Oklahoma had experienced relatively low numbers of coronavirus infections and drawing a major crowd in the deep-red state did not seem like it would be an issue.  While many of the President's allies believed he should focus only on those states that he won in 2016 but that he now appears at risk of losing in November -- like Michigan Arizona Florida and several others -- Oklahoma seemed a safer bet for a rally that was quickly assuming oversized importance both in the West Wing and at campaign headquarters.  Though Trump formally launched his campaign one year ago in Orlando he started telling people in recent weeks that the Tulsa event was the ""real launch."" He reasoned that his abysmal poll numbers were only because of the coronavirus lockdowns and posited on several occasions that he hasn't been trying to run against Biden yet.  The rally came the same day the Trump campaign announced it had raised $74 million in May in conjunction with the Republican National Committee -- $7 million less than what Biden and the Democratic National Committee raised.  For many advisers particularly those who worked on the President's 2016 campaign the rally was regarded as a return to normal after what has been one of his roughest stretches of his presidency.  ""The rally is a great signal to the rest of the country that it's time to get things moving again"" Tim Murtaugh Trump's campaign communications director told CNN last week. ""Americans will now see the contrast between the President's record of accomplishment versus the history of failure Biden brings to the table.""  But nearly as soon as Trump announced his rally from the White House Cabinet Room -- ""a beautiful new venue -- brand-new -- and we're looking forward to it"" he said -- the problems began.  Upon advice from lawyers the campaign applied a liability waiver to the online sign-up form for potential attendees warning ""you and any guests voluntarily assume all risks related to exposure to COVID-19.""  Neither Trump nor his campaign aides were aware that the date they'd selected coincided with Juneteenth. Even after the date was pointed out some of Trump's campaign aides and White House staffers downplayed any problems insisting it wasn't unusual to hold campaign events on holidays.  But this June 19 was not like past years. Amid a national outpouring of grief and anger following Floyd's death the holiday had assumed a special significance in highlighting the country's racist history as millions continue to protest that history's legacy and still-existent consequences.  After a Black Secret Service agent explained the significance to the President - and after Trump polled his orbit to find no one who had heard of Juneteenth -- the President began to consider changing the date. He also heard directly from Sen. James Lankford an Oklahoma Republican who told him a date-change would be wise.  Trump agreed but told his campaign advisers to schedule the rally the day before Juneteenth a Thursday rather than move the rally a day later to Saturday. Trump explained that Saturday evenings were a television ratings void and that he wanted massive viewership of his first campaign foray in months.  Instead Trump's aides convinced him that a weekend would draw a larger crowd because potential attendees would not be at work. And the campaign announced it was scouting outdoor venues to accommodate an overflow audience unable to fit inside the 19000-capacity BOK Center.  For the past week the rally has consumed Trump's attention according to people familiar with the matter. The President invited Oklahoma's governor to the White House on Thursday for a roundtable that was also a venue for Trump to hype his event.  ""We're going to be in Oklahoma. And it's a crowd like I guess nobody's seen before. We have tremendous tremendous requests for tickets like I think probably has never happened politically before"" Trump said. Later during the same event Trump appeared to be idly scrolling through his phone while two women business owners detailed their experience during the pandemic.  On Friday with no events on his schedule Trump appeared to be focused on the next day's rally. He threatened potential protesters on Twitter saying they would not be afforded gentle treatment if they came to his event. Upon learning there would be a curfew in place on the three nights surrounding the rally Trump phoned Tulsa's mayor to protest. Trump tweeted afterward the mayor had agreed to rescind the curfew for his supporters who were camped outside.  By the time he awoke on Saturday Trump was enthusiastic about the evening ahead. But he soured when he turned on his television to find coverage not of massive crowds but of Berman whose dismissal Trump did not anticipate would generate controversy and whose refusal to leave impeded upon coverage of the President's forthcoming rally.  Hours later -- as Vice President Mike Pence was stalled on his way to Tulsa while thunderstorms rolled over Joint Base Andrews -- Trump learned of the six staffers who had tested positive for coronavirus while they were advancing the President's rally. The campaign had initially not planned to test staff beforehand unless it was expected they would come into contact with the President Vice President or one of his children and was not planning to reveal that several staffers had tested positive. But the news leaked and several campaign staffers found out about the cases from media reports one of those officials told CNN.  Trump was furious when it was reported that several staffers had tested positive believing it -- like Berman -- was overshadowing his event the person said. By the time he was departing the White House for Tulsa the jubilant resumption of rallies was already turning to resentment.  If there was one glimmer of light it was the crowd.  ""The event in Oklahoma is unbelievable. The crowds are unbelievable. They haven't seen anything like it"" Trump said as he departed the South Lawn in Washington DC.  It was a different story in Tulsa. The wide avenue where a stage had been erected for an overflow crowd in the tens of thousands was virtually vacant and planned speeches there by Trump and Pence were scrapped. Inside the arena it was only partly full as the President was arriving.  Murtaugh asserted that the smaller-than-expected crowds were partially a result of interference by protesters though none of the CNN reporters and producers on the ground in Tulsa saw any incident with protesters trying to block supporters from attending.  Ultimately aides said Tulsa was about something far more important than mere politicking; after a dreary stretch the event was meant to provide Trump the adulation he craves and to re-energize him after weeks spent wallowing in sagging poll numbers and critical media coverage.  Trump told staff he wanted all of his surrogates on-hand when he landed in Tulsa on Saturday night so aides invited dozens and chartered a private plane to transport them all. Photos from the flight show none wearing masks.  ""I guarantee you after Saturday if everything goes well he's going to be in a much better mood"" a Trump political adviser said. ""He believes that he needs to be out there fighting and he feeds off the energy of the crowds.""  After Trump finished speaking a person familiar told CNN that two Secret Service agents had also tested positive for coronavirus.   2020 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System Inc.

"INTO THE ABYSS 118 A  I am a man without a master I am not obligated to anyone I am free I was born free.  I have some commitments I have a few obligations I have some loyalties I have some morals and few boundaries of character. My choice all of my own choosing.  I was asked to run for a small public office but I am not politically affiliated and my freedom is not for sale neither is my soul. You can not today run for an office without obligating yourself to a few people with money for whom you will have to return favors for their support you can only do that if you sell your soul.  Freedom can not be purchased but you have to pay a price to be free. I have more people that ""hate my guts"" but they will also vouch for my character. They will hate me and still say that I am a good guy I don't mind I can still be courteous and sociable and they know.  Life is a game after all some of us can play it better than others the idea of gambling is that you win a little more than fifty percent of the time that is all you need to do.  But we get lost not that we are innocent but that we don't know ourselves who we are what we are capable of what we really know. A blind person will follow a one eyed man who can not read the map but will still tell you he is going to his destination. Just don't ask him how.  And this explains much of our love life our relationships and even our politics.  So what about our politics? We are proud Americans we love our country we love our freedoms we love our # Flag we love our #Constitution  how can there be any doubt. We fly our flag we don't like people that burn our flag we love our freedom and we love our country.  But I digress whether you are a lefty or a righty conservative or liberal Republican or a Democrat your actions and your words do not match what you say you are how you really feel  you are just full of it a lost soul without guidance or purpose you are a useful idiot mentally and psychologically immature you have no idea even how you really feel.  M. N. R.  27 SEPTEMBER 2020  I have never been guilty of being politically correct one plays the game only if he wants to I have literally lived under "" moral police "" also so no. Should one have boundaries absolutely but that comes from maturity and maturity comes from ""true knowledge and reason""  not a dogma.  ( M. N. R.)  It is about money and power the politics is it has always been so. We have been asleep at the wheel. Being entertained to death. No one wants to work hard no one wants to struggle we have become like a stray dog or cat you feed them once and they are yours to use and abuse as you wish. M. N. R.  This not even a partisian issue it is a self inflicted wound we keep electing the same crooked douchebags. Term limits ban the lobbyists finance the campaigns with public funds. Require the politicians as to how they got rich even after leaving the office.  M.. N. R  IF YOU HAVE BEEN IGNORANT FOR TOO LONG YOU BECOME AFRAID OF LEARNING SOMETHING NEW AND HAVING TO CHANGE YOUR POINT OF VIEW  (M. N. R.)  INTO THE ABYSS 118 B  Time flies and I lose track of time I like to sleep but I also like to stay up late my days are busy seven days a week I have things to get done I have responsibilities I don't work hard or do any menial work anymore I do work though. I also like to read I like to learn I hate TV any kind of TV I watch segments of various programs on various channels. We should know why the TV has programming it is for programming your mind no matter what you are watching sitcom news commentary you are programmed according to your choice.  So I watched the debate or what was called a debate. Mind you I worked in War Planning I took part in high level discussions debating merits of plans making deals writing letters of agreement managing airspace and deconfliction airspace. I helped set mission priorities I know how to discuss things how to make deals how to prioritize how to give and how to take. The mission of the two candidates was to bring their programs and their messages to the American people not to their parties and their believers. Were I at the head of the table where this debate was conducted I would have called in the MPs and had the two arrested. For insubordination and for wasting my time.  How can a country progress where the ""one nation"" is willing to tear itself apart and have winners and losers on the same team. How do we move forward? You can't even have mule team or a team of dogs where one half is pulling one way the other half in the opposite direction.  If there is a ""Conspiracy theory "" then I have one it is time cause the population to split the country to self destruct and the rich to escape without having to answer for the crime of looting the country and selling us into slavery.  In his Dictionary of Received Ideas Gustav Flaubert explained Idiots ""Anyone that thinks differently than you"" and this our state of mind today even after 110 years nothing has changed.  The conspiracy is not that the Children are lost it has happened through out human history it will still happen tomorrow they are also found they always have been human trafficking tragic as it is also has happened and still is happening the task force credited lately for discovering such children has been in the headlines lately only because the subject made headlines the task force was established and has been finding children since 2015.  It has become our culture we watch sitcoms and laugh about the cruelty that is hidden there in we joke about prisoners being tortured the killings captured on videos are the big joke for the partisans why should one be surprised that #Trump would joke about the disabled that we are willing to take away food from the hungry healthcare from the needy that we are okay with kids in cages. Don't look at others look at what we have become a society of vultures. We don't even take care of our kids raising them with love and respect or teaching them about a moral and ethical living. We subject our children to abuse putting our personal ""freedoms"" and ""desires"" above their welfare and needs. How do you think these will grow up how will they learn to respect their elders their parents and even themselves.  M. N. R. 02 OCTOBER 2020",political,Facebook
Today once again I was asked why I would run because I am Conservative and my running may split the vote and allow a Democrat to win. I am going to break this down Barny style for you (as in Barny the dinosaur).  First I am not a Republican I am a Libertarian/Independent a Constitutional Conservitive and the current GOP is anything but that. I owe nothing to that party I am my own man through and through. Second what makes Michelle Fischbach entitled to be the only one running who is not a Democrat? Because she holds it now? No one can be more worthy? Is that it? I do not buy it. Third President Trump won this district with 65% of the vote if you are worried she might lose now because a Libertarian Independent is running that should tell you she should not be there to start with. Once she is gone the GOP leadership who put her there without input from the grass roots should probably be next to go.  For those in the GOP who are so scared of a Democrat winning because I am running. You Sir or Madam are as much a sheep as those you accuse of being sheep it maybe a different breed but a sheep none the less. You like to call yourself a wolf but a coyote/ hyaena may be a better analogy then a wolf eating off the plate of another. Because your scared you operate out of a fear of loss you are so scared to take a chance that may make things better because you would risk something. One word comes to mind. Coward. Do not try to talk me out of running because of your FEAR. I am not scared; I am putting myself on the line for this. If you keep voting for the lesser of two evils we should not have to listen to you complain about the results.  I believe in playing nice until it is time not to play nice (Roadhouse anyone?) and this is one of those times. President Trump tried to drain the swamp from the top from the throne so to speak. We all see how that worked out. While I am all about draining the swamp and fighting the establishment I do not operate from the top. I am a pig farmer who works in the trenches and I am not scared to get my hands a little dirty. It is a job that needs to be done (anyone know if Mike Rowe is still doing Dirty Jobs?).  I believe character is important I do not play the political games of not telling you where I stand on issues I say where I am and let the cards fall as they may. I am not a politician what you see is what you get. If this hurts your feelings you are probably everything you despise. If this does not show you I am not your normal politician nothing probably will this is ME this is the Bull that will run through DC.,political,Facebook

Can we please call up President Trump to be a pinch hitter on this one?,political,Facebook
Starting tomorrow Midlothian Texas will begin early voting for May 1st special election. This election will include replacing the late Congressman Ron Wright in the US Congress for the Texas 6th District as well as local bond elections city council positions and school board positions. I have briefly researched the 23 congressional candidates and have narrowed down to five that I would consider endorsing. This page is dedicated to creating a centrists political party that primarily wants to eliminate federal deficit spending and eventually pay down our national debt as well as develop compromises to solve our problems by forcing the two predominant parties to work together. For the sake of fairness I have selected two Republicans and two Democrats that I like as well as the one Libertarian. Here are my thoughts on the candidates. Republicans Michael Wood calls himself a conservative Republican and does not seem to be a centrist but there are things I really like about him. He is a Purple Heart veteran and I admire him for that. He states his goal is to repair the Republican Party from the damage Donald Trump has inflicted upon it and restore it to a respected party. This alone shows he has great courage and wants to separate himself from the far right. John Anthony Castro does not call himself a centrists but is a fiscal conservative. He also has innovative ideas for solving some of Americas problems. Democrats Patrick Moses is retired from a 32 year career in Federal Law Enforcement. He has stated his desire to reach across the aisle so this gives him centrist creeds. Jana Lynn Sanchez does not state any centrists ideals but she grew up and lives in the area. Her position on issues are typical Democrat positions but does not seem to carry socialist values. Libertarian Phil Gray has a plan to help pay down the debt through immigration reform similar to some Independence Party plans. I do like Libertarian ideas on reforming drug laws but I do have a problem with a lot of Libertarians wanting to pull back American influence from around the world.  I did not research the city council and school board candidates so I will not comment on those races. I do have an opinion on the bond elections though. Midlothian City services do seem to have outgrown the current City Hall so I endorse the bonds for a new facility that includes a city library. As an avid lap swimmer I also endorse building a rec center with indoor and outdoor pools. I am not sure about contracting the YMCA to operate it though. Are we taxpayers paying to build a YMCA facility? I once used YMCA pools for lap swimming until they forced adult swimmers into a single lane to make room for profitable swim lessons for children. I endorse the bond proposal for new roads also. I cannot endorse the bond proposal for a new police station. This has nothing to do with the defund police movement. In my day job I visit police facilities for a number of city departments in various sized cities. I once worked in the Midlothian police station and remember thinking that it was rather large for a city this size. I know our city is growing and the department may eventually outgrow the current facility but I think it has room for growth inside its current facility with some possible remodeling. One amenity this city does not seem to be investing in is parks. I have been recently working in Flour Mound and was impressed by all of the green space there. There is quite a bit of wooded land in Midlothian I think the city should be trying to acquire for future parks. Many cities in North Texas have beautiful parks and trails and parkland is considered high when ranking a citys quality of life and I would hate to see Midlothian not keep up with our neighbors.,political,Facebook
Oct 16th 2020 7:00 AM  Morning Note: Pause..Do not Panic..  Over the last 30 days I have received calls from non-clients as well as run into investors in the community and I am hearing an alarming trend.  The common theme is the selling of portfolios before the election. I have heard different stories that the market could crash if one party controls the legislative and executive branches.  However some investors' justification does not have a firm rationale.  If investors are contributing to their 401k or 403b and are focusing on the long term events like this should not worry them. If the stock market had a correction then employees would see their contributions buying more shares of a mutual fund during any decline.  Regardless of events investors should review their investments and re-balance their investments on a semi-annual or annual basis.  During these election cycles I explain that there are always some investments that perform better under one administration than another. But it never hurts to review the politics and make some adjustments to any portfolio during those times.  If investors look back to late 2016 we had a similar situation with a pullback in the market. There were investors that sold their investments after election night thinking the market would go into a free-fall.  Those investors missed out on a tremendous rally that took place in 2016 and 2017. Some investors did not want to pay a premium to get back into the market and watched from the sidelines as the market continued to run-up.  2020 has been a strong year for some investments but there have been several sectors that have not done well.  Recently I received a call from a company asking me to review their 401k plan to see if we could recommend something that was better.  As I explained to the CFO the plan had limited choices and employees had little to no on-going education about investing.  This was a major part of the problem for the plan but the overall performance of the funds and the high fees were not helping either.  All in all it led to some employees investing too conservatively some being too aggressive and some to invest only in the money market because they were just nervous.  At my firm our clients have a strategy for the upcoming election but it does not entail throwing the baby out with the bathwater.  I always remind people selling everything and sticking your head in the sand is not a strategy. In todays world placing your money in a bank and getting zero to a half a point is not going to get a person to their goal.  For example if there is a so-called blue wave that sweeps the elections I can see several scenarios occurring. In one of those scenarios if a stimulus deal is not reached prior to the election I could see a much larger stimulus package passed by the Congress and that action would have a positive 6 -12-month impact on the market.  I could see a rally that could last during that period. So if investors chose to sell everything they would miss out on the rally like 2016-2017. While I am not saying that this will occur the possibility does exist.  After the 6-12 months I could see factors like taxes and other political issues coming to the forefront and that would require additional research before I could decide on a possible new course.  I believe everyone should speak to their financial advisor or any financial advisor before making a radical decision to sell everything because of an election outcome.  Election outcomes tend to affect Wall Street in unpredictable ways.  As I mentioned earlier the market sold off for a day or two after President Trump won the election but then staged an impressive run for the next two years.

Dear Riverside County Democrats and Joe Biden Supporters  I hope you are doing well and that this post finds you safe and healthy.  The current protests that are happening are heartbreaking and are hurting our country. Our communities are suffering everyday and we need to unite together to create a better future. A future in which we can live together and call this nation our home. America has lost its soul and together we can find the soul that Vice President Joe Biden is now leading us to.  The protests come from a source of pain for people of color who have had to live with systemic racism all their lives. Trump is inciting violence by not addressing the country; he is letting the country fall into disarray. While he sits in the white house blaming governors and saying they are weak Joe Biden is in our communities leading our country. As a congenital optimist he sees a future that we can all be happy to be a part of.  Protestors are making their voices heard and they will not stop until the officers involved in George Floyds death are held accountable. You can make your voices heard as well at the election. We are capable of doing more together as a society. No longer can we stand on the periphery; we must stand together at the elections. As your District 42 delegate I will make sure your voice is heard and I will work tirelessly to ensure Joe Biden becomes our next president.

"This Is So Unfair to Me: Trump Whines About His COVID-19 Victimhood as Campaign Flails  BY GABRIEL SHERMAN VANITY FAIR  As he headed into Memorial Day weekend Donald Trump complained that he was COVID-19s biggest victim. He was just in a f...ing rage said a person who spoke with Trump late last week. He was saying This is so unfair to me! Everything was going great. We were cruising to reelection!  Even as the death toll neared 100000 and unemployment ranks swelled to over 38 million Trump couldnt see the pandemic as anything other than something that had happened to him. The problem is he has no empathy the adviser said. Trump complained that he should have been warned about the virus sooner. The intelligence community let me down! he said.  The White House declined to comment.  Trumps outburst reflected his growing frustration that at this stage of the race he is losing to Joe Biden. According to a Republican briefed on the campaigns internal polls Trump is trailing Biden by double digits among women over 50 in six swing states. Trump knows the numbers are bad. Its why hes thrashing about the Republican said.  Even those closest to Trump have been privately worried the election is slipping away. According to a source Melania Trump warned the president during their trip to India in February to take the virus response seriously. He totally blew her off the source said. Melania later told people that Trump only hears what he wants to hear and surrounds himself with yes-people and family the source added.  The first ladys office did not respond to a request for comment.  This article truncated for brevity is attributed as ""Doug Mills/NY Times/Redux""",political,Facebook
When did you first realize that Donald Trump is racist?,political,Facebook
I trust everybody out there knows that 1) President Trump passed unemployment compensation which pays more than working for many and 2) Joe Biden extended it. Trump was forced to compromise on it Biden rejoiced in it it seems. Both parties are destroying the work ethic in this nation. Think moderate and let's get the 40% back to work. That's how we fix things.,political,Facebook
Dear Trump voter -  Can we talk? We promise to be civil and reasonable. No name calling cussing lies or false argument.  Were not lifelong liberal Democrats. We are libertarian Republicans. We believe in personal and economic liberties. Free minds and free markets.  Yes we support Biden and you support Trump. But whoever wins what do we do after the election? We have to live together but we dont even speak the same language anymore. We try to understand each other but we cant.  Our society no longer treasures the truth learning education reason and sound argument common sense. Most political conversations now consist of slogans and insults.  But history matters. Constitutional law is important. Political philosophy is good. Defined terms. Sound premises. Logical conclusions. These arent political; these are the foundation of our American society.  We hope you will read this letter think and answer us. A personal email address is provided below. And we will try in turn to engage you. Our country and maybe even the planet depend on it.  We are in despair. Why? Because we cant hug our adult son our only child. Because we cant see our 87-year-old mother who said on the phone to us: The world is wrong. Just so wrong. Everything is wrong.  Viruses arent political but politics can affect them. No the President isnt responsible for the virus but he is responsible for not addressing it early not addressing it properly and for keeping the truth from us.  The virus is a real virus; the numbers are real. We know people who have died almost died have heart damage suffered. Its not a hoax.  We ache every time Trump takes the true meaning of freedom and turns it into a faux freedom like not wearing a mask. (If you think about it freedom doesnt include the right to recklessly endanger others.)  We are in despair because we are on track for more unnecessary deaths from this pandemic the loss of so many individual souls passing alone dying of suffocation wondering why and how it came to this in America.  But lets leave all that for a moment.  We despair over the corruption too. Trump took your campaign donations for his personal use. He uses his government position to line his own pockets. He has no sense of conflict of interest or transparency  what the heck is in those tax returns anyway?  We also cringe every time he alienates an ally and embraces a dictator; every time he misapplies the great constitutional principles of due process and free speech; every time he confuses the rule of law with law and order  destroying the first and exploiting the second; every time he politicizes the independent judiciary; every occasion where he is ignorant of separation of powers federalism and all these essences of our Republic.  But the epitome of our despair is the hatred. Trump has insulted women the disabled soldiers anyone who disagrees with him. He is just plain mean. He has incited violence telling police to rough people up even as police brutality becomes an increasing problem that tears us apart. He takes the worst of our history and ourselves and ignites it for his own power and advantage.  No matter what you think of the Black Lives Matter movement most of the protesters are peaceful. We know because we are two of them. We protesters are simply upset that police are killing too many people  in a free society cops dont get to be judge and executioner. We believe in individual liberties and justice just like you do.  But even if we Americans dont agree on the things weve mentioned above dont we agree on the right to live even for the elderly? On truth decency and kindness? Or maybe we can go further and agree on constitutionalism saving the monarch butterfly or a free (if irritating) press?  Surely we agree on something. And if we do we beg you to reconsider your support for Trump. Because he is against all of these fundamental American  and human  principles.
