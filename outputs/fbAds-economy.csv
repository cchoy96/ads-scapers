"U.S. AND RUSSIA  Rising tension between the U.S and Russia should be a cause for concern among all Americans. Although recently the tensions between the nuclear armed powers have slightly eased due to the Russian pullback of troops along the Ukrainian border the general trajectory of the relationship points toward eventual conflict. Only ""the people"" can restrain the movement towards war. To enable this restraint it is perhaps helpful to view U.S.-Russia relations from the Russian perspective. Let me qualify the following by stating that I am not an expert on U.S.-Russia relations; but from a layperson's perspective this is what I see.  Russia has been pushed around by the West since its dissolution in December of 1991. At that time it's state dominated command economy was collapsing and there began a movement towards a free market capitalist system first gradually during the late 1980's under the Soviet leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev then very rapidly under Russia's first democratically elected President Boris Yeltsin.  During the economic collapse of the early 1990's western nation's offered aid to Russia largely through the G7--a group of advanced industrialized nations--and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) contingent on the dismantling of the Russian state dominated economic system. The transformation from the old to the new system within Russia was highly controversial with President Boris Yeltsin pushing for reform while Russia's parliamentary body consisting largely of communist and ultranationalist resisted the rapid transformation. This deeply divided the Nation.  It would be hard to overestimate the hardship this transformation imposed on the Russian people. Widespread homelessness child and adult prostitution increased rates of alcoholism decreased life expectancy all accompanied the transformation to the western style economic model. From 1991-1998 during the western aided transformation Russia's GDP fell nearly 40%. During the 1996 presidential election the G7 and the IMF pumped billions of dollars into the Russian economy in order to salvage a Yeltsin victory from a stiff challenge by a communist opponent: election interference by any measure.  The transformation left deep scars on the Russian people and depending on one's view of the transformation generated resentment against the West. Many among the older generation the intelligentsia and workers longed for a return to Soviet times. Conspiracy theories abound which suggest the West deliberately undermined the Russian state. One argument states that current President Putin's hybrid authoritarian democratic political model where the U.S. currently seems to be headed was an effort to establish order out of the chaos of the 1990's. The U.S. condemns Putin's trend towards authoritarianism but little such condemnation existed in 1993 when U.S. President Clinton supported the free market oriented Yeltsin's unconstitutional dissolution of the Russian parliament which had resisted the transformation to the capitalist model. It is of course possible that Russia would have suffered equal economic hardship had Russia persisted on its state dominated path but this matters little as people were suffering and the suffering was due to the then current transformation process.  During West-East negotiations over the reunification of Germany during 1990 Russian concerns about NATO expansion eastward towards the Russian border were allayed when U.S. Secretary of State James Baker assured the Russians that NATO would not expand ""one inch eastward"" towards the Russian border. By the end of the 1990's decade NATO expanded: eastward to include three former Soviet Republics; since then it has expanded eastward to include eleven more states most former Soviet Republics three of which: Estonia Latvia and Lithuania lie directly on a Russian border. NATO has a working relationship with both Georgia and Ukraine both former Soviet Republics which also lie on the Russian border and both of which are working towards NATO membership. Russians find NATO expansion to its borders as threatening and in breach of Western promises to not expand ""one inch eastward"" towards the Russian border.  Russia's 2014 forceful annexation of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula transferred to Ukraine by Russia during 1954 under former Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev can be seen as an effort to protect both the Russian border as well as the Russian Black Sea fleet partially housed on the Crimean peninsula. Further both Ukraine and Georgia have experienced western friendly coups both with some level of U.S. support.  Most recently in response to continued tensions between Ukraine and Russia the U.S. had threatened to float two naval warships into the Black Sea which would be the equivalent of Russian warships sailing into the Gulf of Mexico. How do you think that might work out?  The former great power undoubtedly feels threatened and humiliated by the above turn of events. Russia views itself as a world power which has been undermined by the neoliberal economic order. Russian bashing among U.S. politicians generally works well across the full political spectrum although somewhat less so among conservatives since Trump; and the U.S. libertarian movement generally opposes international entanglement and war.  There is no effort here to suggest Russia is holier than its western counterparts. Hierarchy is hierarchy and it knows no other way than domination and submission. If the tables were turned perhaps the Russians would act in the same manner. This assuredly is the view of the hierarchical actors who play this nonsensical game. Just as assuredly however there are people in Russia as in the U.S. who desire peace. It is hard for the peacemakers to rise to power when there is so much turmoil in the world. To even speak of peace is often viewed as naive. If in the U.S a significant peace movement were to evolve this would allow room for the Russians to do the same. If not we are doomed to ""solutions"" by war. There seems to be no shortage of those who belong to the war movement.  To protest the U.S. movement towards war is not an unpatriotic act. It is perhaps the highest act of patriotism. Young people who often join the military in an effort to fulfill a deep sense of idealism should not be subject to the loss of life and limb in order to fulfill the political and ideological ambitions of a cynical ruling elite. To love one's nation is to embrace the potential of its youth not to sacrifice its youth to the gods of material and political ambitions. It is time for the insanity to end.",political,Facebook
"A CONSPIRACY THEORY B Part 1 Since this is section B it means you need to look up Section A  and section A has two parts so I will have to add at least another part to the section also. I an talking about A Conspiracy theory it will someday get in to discussing a real conspiracy probably but for now I am focused on the current situation we find our country in. There are many that accuse Trump of dividing the country but we have been a divided country for a very long time. The truth is that United States was always a divided nation where the people learned to live together and get along as the things changed we adjusted to the changes. We were divided even before the Civil war heck that is why there was a civil war we fought and then we adjusted we swept our differences under the rug but not for long soon we developed the Jim Crow laws in the south the racism went out a spread all over the country. There were lynchings in Montana Oregon had laws against blacks and so on. The federal and state governments passed laws to disenfranchise the blacks also. And this is not even the topic here. The fact is we know very little of our own history and yet we are proud that we know everything there is to know and we deny the truth and facts when presented as falsehood as they don't match our ignorance of them. Now there is theory being promoted that 9/11 was an inside job it is being promoted by the same people that support DJT for president and that DJT has actually accepted their support and promoted their ideology without however coming out and saying the same. So what is our reality and what is our truth. If 9/11 was an inside job then why hasn't Trump said so outright or is he using these people as useful idiots. The irony is that these same people are also the supporters of our military but they are not upset with Trump for insulting our armed forces. Something just doesn't add up unless someone is brain dead. How does one reconcile this? But are we not the same nation where white people on #foodstamps and #medicaid are against ""welfare"" because only the blacks are on welfare they think and people on #socialsecurity complain about #socialism. How do you fight this level of stupidity. More will follow M. N. R. 11 SEPTEMBER 2020  Yet it is the simple minds that search for simple solutions a complex problem is overwhelming it requires nuanced reaction it requires deep thought and meditation it requires knowledge patience and understanding it requires logic and methodology. O to be a simpleton. Yet the greatest nation in the world ever does not have the time the knowledge the logic and the study. Trump is not the first simple minded person Reagan was also simple minded but the difference is that Reagan listened to his advisors and for better or for worse he followed he followed through with his tax cuts and NAFTA he screwed the poor as all politicians are apt to left or right and the nation suffered he lied about a balanced budget and increased the deficits he went along with Iran-Contra his NAFTA deal destroyed the democratic cities and ruined their economy setting up the decline of black jobs and break up of unions and middle class. Today when Trump talks about the democrat run cities we need only to look back at NAFTA destruction of unions and globalization. But that is only one part the liberal mantra of sexual freedom is the other the destruction of family unit the spousal abuse the divorce rate single parent family is second. Add to that the drug problem both legal and illegal and abusive police tactics and you get 2020. Yes I have a master's degree I can write better but I like to write at a level that an average person can get the gist of my message. I have written about the economy at length also I post some of writings here again from time to time. You can follow the page and look. The problems we have today didn't happen overnight we had set up the ground work for the last 40 years or more. We only didn't know or didn't care no one did not Trump not Biden nor anyone else.  I posted earlier today. ""A dog is not aware that the master that throws him a bone every once in a while is himself eating the steak but the dog will fight another dog even to death over the bone thrown his way"". I ask my friends what do we want to take America back to? What is plan where is the map and will America look like when we have taken it back no one has an answer not even Mike Pence. I know where we are going if we don't change our ways liberal or conservative Republican or Democrat  we are going to hell in a hand basket of course. An we won't like it when we get there. Destruction of a nation should not be a matter of policy undermining of the #Constitution should not be the aim looting and burning or killing ""other fellow Americans"" should not be the plan of either side. But we are being led over the cliff by both sides. More will follow M. N. R. 13 SEPTEMBER 2020",political,Facebook
Two Growing Systems of Government Revenue  One from taxpayer earnings and one from no earnings at all.  Another way of saying the same thing is that there is 'Wizard of Oz' money and real world money.  A phenomenon has been growing since the sub prime crisis of 2008 to increasingly bail out Wall Street and the big banks by 'printing money' out of thin air that is then used to buy assets i.e. real estate stock buy backs and mortgage backed securities.  The Federal Reserve now owns more than 30% of the mortgage backed security market in the entire United States. This means massive government control of private assets into public hands.  And there is no end in sight as the Fed is purchasing $120 billion dollars of Treasury bills per month to boost the economy. While the Fed and Treasury are doing what they believe is the right thing the consequences of government spending that is not backed by current taxpayer money is beginning to show cracks in our economy through rising inflation. Trillions of dollars printed into the country's money supply does have unintended results contrary to most MMT (Modern Monetary Theory) theories.  One consequence is the devaluation of the dollar meaning that the purchasing power of families is diminishing through higher prices and this trend may not be as temporary as the Federal Reserve believes.  The whole system of printing money for ever increasing costs of new government programs is coming to a head. We are like a family who is going bankrupt that then decides to max out a new credit card to pay for the debt that has already been incurred thus putting off the day of reckoning that will surely hit even harder than it would have if nipped in the bud earlier.  Ponzi schemes are defined as a fraudulent investing scam which generates returns for earlier investors with money taken from later investors. The government is caught in a similar scheme. It is printing trillions of dollars to pay for current debt spending with newly created debt.  Thus more taxes are needed to be raised from hard working taxpayers to pay just the interest on the national debt (now nearly $400 billion dollars per year) and this is with an interest rate of 1.5 percent. The government can't afford to have interest rates rise because a relatively modest interest rate comparatively speaking of just 6% would break the sovereignty of our whole system. We only take in $3.5 trillion dollars in taxpayer revenue per year. A 6% interest rate would equal approximately $1.8 trillion dollars half of our total revenues.  In order to prevent a crash the government will simply print trillions and trillions more in order to support the system from collapsing with ever increasing rates of inflation as a result making the cost of living so high as to be unmanageable.  Taxpayers must start demanding greater responsibility and forthrightness from our government and the Federal Reserve. We the government speaks of government spending it is a bit of a misnomer. It is taxpayer spending. We the people are footing the bill and are being put ever more in an impossible debt situation. There is no free lunch period.  What to do? Educate yourself on the goings on and be as self sufficient as possible.  'No taxation without representation' was the original protest movement against monarchical rule in this country. We now find ourselves in a similar situation. The oligarchic rule of big money has in a real sense become the new 'monarchy' and the people's interests are not being represented in the halls of Congress. We have taxation but no real representation.  The promise of America is still alive but we must begin to get our house in order. Sound principles and sound money have to return in order to give us a solid foundation again. From there we can once again grow and prosper.,political,Facebook
NATIONAL HEALTHCARE MIGHT REQUIRE A TAX CUT???  National healthcare or Medicare for All is not on the near horizon. The debate over national healthcare however will be with us long into the future so the following argument from the Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) school of thought deserves serious consideration. The argument comes from Warren Mosler one of the original MMT theorists hedge fund founder and automobile enthusiast. His argument is National Healthcare might require a tax cut.  In order to understand this argument it is important to understand the MMT view of money its inflationary and deflationary impacts and how it is created. There are different ways in which money is created but it all begins with the public sector. In the public sector there are two actors: the U.S. Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve Regional Banks are actually privately owned by large banks within the corresponding Reserve Districts but for all practical purposes it is a publicly controlled system: created overseen and regulated by Congress.  Money creation begins with the Treasury Department. When the U.S. Treasury spends it creates new money; when it taxes it destroys money. The Federal government is unlike a household which has budget constraints. The Federal government unlike a household creates its own currency and it can create as much currency as it would like. It is not constrained through its ability to tax or borrow in fact neither taxation or borrowing are necessary to fund Federal spending. Taxation and borrowing are however necessary to absorb excessive money out of the economy in order to prevent inflationary pressures. Federal expenditures need not be equal to taxation and borrowings. The supply of money should be calibrated in a manner which neither supplies too much money which is inflationary or too little money which is deflationary. Money is also created when the Federal Reserve purchases securities from the non-commercial banking sector and also when commercial banks create loans. These latter two sources of money creation are not important for our purposes.  Now to Moslers genius argument. U.S. national healthcare costs are roughly 19% of GDP. This is close to double the healthcare cost of the United Kingdom (U.K.) which has a national healthcare system and where healthcare costs are approximately 11% of GDP. If the U.S. as a result of national healthcare were to reduce healthcare spending to the level achieved in the U.K.: 11% then the U.S. would experience a GDP reduction of 8% (19%-11%). Stated differently income to this sector of the economy would be reduced by 8%. A reduction of GDP of this magnitude would have a highly deflationary impact on the U.S. economy. To reinflate the currency a new flow of money would need to be injected into the economy. The easiest way to achieve this would be through increased deficit spending which can occur in one of two ways: either through an increase in Treasury spending i.e. new money creation or through a reduction in taxes i.e. less money destruction. Under this scenario increased deficit spending would be used to fight the deflationary pressures associated with the reduction in healthcare cost. This all works because deficits are only a concern if the deficits create inflationary pressures. Therefore a national healthcare system might as time progresses and healthcare costs are reduced require tax cuts not tax increases as is currently believed in order to overcome the deflationary pressures associated with healthcare cost reductions achieved through a national healthcare plan.  This is an interesting argument which warrants serious consideration.  Comments are welcomed. Please write in respectful and civil tones.

"RANDOM PSYCHOLOGY 131 Welcome been a few days now that I talked said anything in particular time slips away and life is as life always is it is ""busy"". BTW if you are new here  as in if you have joined the page recently qelcome and thank you also please share the page with your friends or on your timeline I will appreciate that. Also if you like they page you can always come back for more I hope that you do. What is the purpose of life? It used to me that many smart people spent their lifetimes looking for a purpose and meaning. Most of us  however are too busy today to spend time contemplating. We talk about the attitude of people when in reality we are actually talking about ourselves only in third person as if the words we are speaking do not describe us individually. I have told you before that I am not a religious or a moral person I do not mean to offend anyone. If you have a God more power to you if you don't it is not my business. Whether you belive in a god or many or none there seems to be a common lesson in most if not all religions which is the same lesson that we can derive from the so called modern day spirituality or the ancient philosophies also. If the ""spirituality "" tries to teach us to let go to let it be to stop worrying and such then does a belief in an omnipotent God also not require the same? If God is in control and God is in charge and if the God's will is done then why are we obsessed with fixing the problems especially with other people while we ignore our own short comings and work on fixing those first. M. N. R. 13 JUN 2021  A little while ago I posted a short article that I came across from another page about bicycles I will leave it up for you to look at. Back in 1989 I gave a lecture on Drugs and community and later in 2007 I wrote about ""War on Poverty""  ( I will post it here again after sometime). Our leaders the politicians are not stupid they know how poverty is good for the economy how the poor create more jobs than the so called ""job creators"" how the little money given to the poor helps them create tens of millions of jobs while the poor are blamed for staying poor. If you don't agree just look at this one small fact if the poor did not get free money they will compete for the menial jobs and drive down the minimum wage. Whether you get all your money from welfare or from a minimum wage job you make almost the same amount. Similarly the drugs and crime are used to create jobs and increase the GDP. Just look at how many jobs are dependent on the drug abuse and crime. The police the lawyers the doctors ambulance crews nurses bondsman detectives  judges jailers prison guards social workers drug abuse counselors the drug makers the list can go on and on all making money and contributing to the increase in GDP. The law makers don't want this to go away. Similarly petty crime to assault and murder to spousal abuse create jobs. A race war that is short of an outright civil war will be welcomed by our leaders as it will consolidate their base and make the economy look good and no one will notice. The first step here is for the public to understand that the politicians in both sides are in on the scam they are happy that you are focusing on and blaming the problem on eachother and they are not even trying to solve the problem. I will have more to say soon like and share the page please and let's talk. M. N. R. 14 JUNE 2021",political,Facebook
Is destroying America a winning electoral strategy?  A few years ago I was listening to a gun hating nut being questioned about his hatred of guns. He was posed with a scenario in which his home was invaded by a person who intended terrible harm to him and his family therefore would he not want a gun available in order to protect his wife and children from all manner of harm. I will never forget his response. He said that he would hide in the closet and call the police. It was then added to the scenario that the police would not arrive in time to save his family. As unbelievable as it was he continued to assert that he would hide in the closet and call the police and re-iterated his opposition to guns under any circumstance. The most basic duty of a father and husband is to protect his family with his life if need be yet he was willing to see everyone he loves destroyed before he would violate the rules of his ideology.  I think this story is important because it helps to provide perspective of leftist ideology in general and how that applies to what is happening in America today. This man no doubt loves his family dearly but the destruction of his family is far less worrisome for him than violating his ideology. If a man who loves his family dearly is willing to see his family destroyed in order to promote his ideology what do you think those who hate this country are willing to do to it in order to promote their ideology? Yes they too are willing to destroy it.  For leftist democrats which really means the entire democrat party because it has been taken over by the loons nothing is more important than their ideology and they are determined and always motivated to achieve power over everyone else. Their political philosophy has been described as a secular religion but it really isnt that. To describe it as a religion is an insult to religions. Theirs is a cult. A cult complete with the mindless chants of the Moonies and the destructive nature of Kool-Aid drinking zombies. They literally have taken to the destruction of every American institution that has made it the greatest country to have ever existed the most beloved most sought after for the hope of a better future and the most depended on to ensure a world free of world domination.  They are trying to create as much havoc as possible in all areas of life because they believe that President Trump will be blamed for it causing him to lose his bid for re-election so that they can usher in their leftist agenda which itself will make complete the destruction they have started. They have embraced the rioting looting and destruction of private and public property. They have embraced the violence that has resulted not only in bodily injury but also many deaths to law abiding citizens and law enforcement officers. They seek to drastically reduce the size of police departments or eliminate them entirely. They have been releasing violent criminals back onto the streets with no regard for the safety of law abiding citizens and some of these animals immediately upon having been released went right out and committed rapes and murders.  They are trying to destroy the economy using Covid 19 as an excuse. Typically the President in office receives the blame for a bad economy so they are trying at every turn to keep Americans locked down and businesses closed to the greatest degree possible. They have trampled civil rights closed businesses for so long that some will never reopen. The science is clear Covid 19 is particularly harmful to the very elderly and those in poor health. It is particularly harmless to all other especially children. But the science be damned they have an economy to destroy.  The democrats are trying to destroy our electoral system by doing away with our borders so that anyone can get in who wants in so that they can then be put on welfare and the voter rolls. They want to do away with the Electoral College which was created to make sure that every State mattered in national elections. They want to do a wholesale vote by mail scheme which will ensure voter fraud because ballots will be and have been mailed to the dead and to those still living who no longer live at the address on record. And no absentee voting isnt the same thing as the scheme the democrats want to put in place. Absentee ballots must be requested. Democrats want to send ballots out to every person registered to vote knowing that probably every precinct in this country has well over 100% of actual eligible voters on the voter rolls. If the election is close one crooked precinct or and handful of illegal votes can throw the entire election. Remember the 2000 presidential election? All of the things they want to do lay bare their fake concern about election integrity and voter rights.  They want to destroy the courts by expanding them with leftist judges who will decide cases properly..the left wing way. The courts are probably the most important target of leftists because they know their looney ideas will never come to fruition if it is up to the American people to decide so the courts staffed with leftist judges will be used to force their leftist agenda onto the American people.  They want to destroy Americanism and replace it with tribalism in order to keep Americans at each others throats particularly blacks and whites. Their obsession with skin color ethnicity and religion mirrors that of the KKK. Listening to their commentary that is laden with such references is full frontal evidence of their bigotry and racism.  They wish to do away with the so-called nuclear family a mother a father and children which is the most important institution known to mankind. The one thing that has caused the greatest harm to black families is the absence of fathers yet here is blm advocating for that very thing which is just another example of how black lives dont matter to blm.  This is just a partial list and are just the beginning for the totalitarian left. Make no mistake about it. It is their goal to ruin America for some grander scheme they want to put in place. Worldwide every one of these attempts to create a fair and just society by taking away freedom and personal property rights have failed completely. What makes these leftists so dangerous is their belief of their own superiority over all others just like the KKK. They are brainwashed brain-dead lunatics free of reason and logic who care about nothing and nobody except their ideology the ideology they want to force onto you. Government takeovers are always done by a very small minority of motivated actors who then gain control of the reins of power. There is a largely silent majority who must stop being silent.

Joe Bidens been in Washington for 47 years and his newfound discovery of the Iron Range is laughable when you consider his anti-mining anti-manufacturing record that now includes his promise to enact the $93 trillion Green New Deal that would abolish mining and manufacturing enforce job-killing tax increases on everyone and send our local economy into a tailspin.

A Green New Deal has become a charged term where some people fear that airplanes and cars will be banned because of considerable disinformation from certain political pockets. A Maine Green Deal New Green Deal Maine Compact for Clean Energy: Call it what you will but here is what I support. The conversion of the former Maine Yankee to a facility capable of transferring 156 GW of energy developed by offshore wind turbines would in itself create thousands of jobs and make Maine 100% powered by clean energy by 2030. Investing in solar for housing would create thousands of jobs. Also important in the effort to reduce emissions is to incentivize the sale and purchases of electric- or hybrid-powered personal vehicles and the development of a statewide infrastructure of electric charging stations to make mobility by electric power accessible and practical. These are all solutions that would help us achieve the goals of emission reduction and 100% clean energy as well as create thousands of jobs that will stimulate Maine's economy. In turn Maine's reputation as an environmental leader will bolster and increase environmental tourism in the state also improving our economy. The environment is our economic stimulus post-Covid. We have the ability to both do good on the environment AND jumpstart a new economy all in one fell swoop if our government is able to keep up with the will of the people.  *Benjamin Meiklejohn is endorsed by .,political,Facebook
To the Voters in NH Senate District 24  I am running for State Senate because I want to preserve the greatness that is the New Hampshire Advantage and that includes no income or sales tax. My opponent Tom Sherman despite his denials has voted twice to impose an income tax on Granite Staters. This is something that would be devastating to our New Hampshire families at a time when so many are already struggling through this COVID economy.  In March Dr. Sherman voted in support of House Bill 712 which included an income tax to support a forced paid family leave plan on businesses and employees. As Governor Sununu noted with his red veto pen on this terrible legislation When NH says No Income Tax. Not Now! Not Ever! We mean it!  It takes verbal gymnastics to claim 0.5 percent of wages per week per employee is not an income tax and yet that is the direct language from the bill Dr. Sherman supported. It is the same language he supported the year prior. Nonetheless he is trying to claim otherwise. If a tax on wages isnt an income tax what is?  I promise the voters of District 24 this: If elected I will always be direct and wont try spin you. I will stand by my votes I wont hide from them. I will always be honest even if it isnt politically expedient. And when I say No income tax not now now ever. I mean it.

"An American Nationalist Voting Index - The Square Deal  This is part of a series examining the issues in the presidential election. To see other articles in the series visit the website version of this article cited below and click on the 2020 Elections tab on the Home page.  Score Biden-.5 Trump +2  Roosevelts commitment to the working man was born of two incidents of violence in his life that challenged his fundamentally conservative impulses. The first was the assassination of President William McKinley by an anarchist which led to Roosevelts succession to the presidency. The anarchists were the Antifa/Islamic terrorists of their time and arose out of the economic inequality and discontent that were byproducts of the Industrial Revolution. The second was his service with the Rough Riders in the Spanish-American war. TR saw bravery in both poor Cowboys and privileged Northeast elite in the charge up San Juan Hill and believed their government owed them a square deal for that bravery which he defined as follows:  ""But when I say am for the square deal I mean not merely that I stand for fair play under the present rules of the game but that I stand for having those rules changed so as to work for a more substantial equality of opportunity and of reward for equally good service.""  At the same time he expected the average worker to respond by contributing to his family community and country not simply demanding a handout from the government.  In todays economy we need to change the rules on economic concentration trade and immigration to give American workers a real chance to achieve the American Dream of stable and independent financial security. Biden and Trump have verifiable records with successes and failures on these issues.  Antitrust Law  The abuses of Big Tech have revived interest in antitrust policy and exposed its deficiencies in todays world economy. The problem lies in the fact we are still trying to regulate these 21st century monopolies using 19th century laws. We learned in the 2008 financial crisis that allowing companies to become too big to fail created a new form of monopoly rents by allowing elites to privatize profits while socializing their risk of loss. Meanwhile Big Tech was finding new ways to leverage customer data to monopolize the Internet advertising and product sales market.  The Trump Administrations challenge to the ATT-Time Warner merger attempted to build a case against bigness itself by attacking vertical mergers. Unfortunately the DC circuit Court of Appeals upheld the merger on the grounds it created useful efficiencies which completely misses the point. They also recently filed a lawsuit against Google over their use of their monopoly power over Internet searches to raise advertising prices. However they have failed to pursue modernization of the antitrust laws themselves Despite this failure these two innovative suits earn Trump a + .5.  The Obama Administration also had an active antitrust docket and challenged several mergers with limited success. The losses in both the Obama and Trump Administrations emphasize the need for a modernization of the rules. The Democratic House also just released a comprehensive report on Big Techs abuses of their market power that could serve as a start for a re-tooling of the statutes. All of this suggests Biden should be given a +.5 on the issue as well.  Trade  Protecting America and its workers from unfair international trade practices has been an area where the Trump Administration has shined. They understood the importance of a strong manufacturing sector and have not subjugated American policy to the slow and sometimes hostile mechanisms of the World Trade Organization. Alan Tonelson of RealityChek has pointed out that the tariffs against China and others have not prevented the manufacturing sector form succeeding during the pandemic without a loss of jobs (see his post from October 19). At the same time the administration preserved the strategically important partnership between the US Canada & Mexico by concluding the U.S.- Mexico-Canada Agreement. Trump deserves a +1 for these achievements.  Bidens record and positions are almost the polar opposite. He wants to return to the multilateral approach ignoring Americas unique great power interest in preserving its internal economic strength. However he has also said he would relax the Chinese tariffs gradually and only upon concessions from the Chinese. Biden says he would prioritize developing an international coalition to challenge Chinese state capitalism as well. The latter positions reduce his negative score to a -.5.  Immigration  Trumps actions to restrict illegal immigration have been divisive haphazard and often poorly justified on ethnic nationalist grounds. However they have changed the dynamic and started to limit the use of immigrant workers to compete with Americans (see my post Immigration  The New Slavery). However Trump failed to seize the opportunity to pass comprehensive immigration legislation when he had a Republican Congress. Because of this failure he deserves only a +.5 on the issue.  Biden and the Democrats have understandably concentrated on the necessity of legalizing immigrants that have been here for years. They then oppose any real future controls on immigration and would expand the number of HIVB-style visas thus allowing big companies to use foreign workers to continue to pay substandard wages. As a result they deserve a -.5 on this issue.  Conclusion  Many other changes in the rules of the game are necessary to give American workers the economic opportunities they deserve. Mere income redistribution is not enough. Americans simply want their government to give them a fair chance to compete and contribute; in short the square deal that TR believed in and for which he fought.

For all the companies that will be requiring their employees to get vaccinated or lose their position I ask one thing sign an agreement stating that if your workers suffer any medical issues from the vaccine that you will cover all cost. If you trust the vaccine then put your money where your mouth is. Im not anti vaccine I am for consent. Besides its super safe so what do you have to fear. Ill let you in on a little secret but dont tell anybody the economy is in real trouble. These companies are in a bind especially trying to find good staff. If your employers demand you get it ask for coverage in writing. If they refuse band together and walk out. They need you more than you need them I assure you. I wouldnt go back without a raise for your troubles either. You own yourself! ,political,Facebook
Dear Neighbors  My name is Tina Posterli and I'm running to serve on the Long Beach City Council. I'm a 20-year resident of Long Beach and have been involved with issues in our community since the day I moved here.

Everywhere you turn in 2021 the environmentalists are pushing to limit fossil fuels or decarbonize the economy. At first blush that would seem bad for the energy sector but it appears just the reverse as the price of Brent and WTi continue to steadily climb to their highest prices since 2018. Why? The elite have had more success in curtailing production than they have had in curtailing demand which is improving with an improving economy.  Watch the headlines activists Larry Fink and Black Rock supported a new hedge funds effort to unseat two Exxon board members sighting Environmental Social & Corporate Governance (ESG) guidelines to reduce Exxons slow action in reducing emissions. Across the Atlantic European oil giants are reducing major drilling plans to curry favor with ESG advocates.  The goal of many of these activists is the de-carbonization of the U.S. and world economies. But action is not limited to just one side of this confrontation. 15 State Treasurers sent a letter last week to the Biden Climate Envoy John Kerry expressing concern with recent hostile actions towards the Oil and Gas industry.

Below is a great look at the impact of the coming election! It is from KeepingCurrentMatters that is one of my key sources to stay up with the market. This post was sent to encourage us that sellers and buyers will really come back in 2021.  With the debate tonight it couldn't be better timed!!  As you know from my many posts and my blog I know this is true. Real Estate will be your best investment in 2021  DRE#02098949 HOW WILL THE 2020 ELECTION AFFECT REAL ESTATE? Whether were ready for it or not the 2020 presidential election is right around the corner.  As if this year hasnt brought enough uncertainty an election could be causing your clients to question their buying and selling plansagain.  Rocky political environments can create instability in the stock market-causing consumer confidence to drop. But the real estate market isnt rockyits rock solid. And delaying plans could mean your clients missing out on once-in-a-lifetime affordability.  To get to the heart of this its important to understand how the history of past presidential elections combined with todays market factors might play out in real estate this time around.  Heres what we know.  The Real Estate Market Might Slow Down-But Not for Long Historically speaking home sales typically slow down in the fall following the spring and summer rush. BTIG a research and analysis company looked at new home sales from 1963-2019 and noted an average decline of -9.8% in November compared to October.  In that same report they noticed that this decline becomes slightly more exaggerated in presidential election years dropping as much as -15% from October to November.  So why the decline? BTIG attributes it mostly to do with buyers and sellers just becoming more cautious during that time.  They go on to explain This caution is temporary and ultimately results in deferred sales as the economy jobs interest rates and consumer confidence all have far more meaningful roles in the home purchase decision than a Presidential election result in the months that follow.  Considering the current state of real estate across the country we can anticipate that while a slow down may occur its effects will only be temporary. Home sales have remained strong throughout the last couple of winters and the competitive nature of todays current market suggests this year should be no different.  The First Year After an Election is the Best for Real Estate While presidential election years may cause consumer weariness another study looked at how the housing market performs after too.  Meyers Research and Zonda a leading real estate research firm found additional data that the year following an election can be the best of the presidential term for home sales.  According to their findings:  In fact the year after a presidential election is the best of the four-year cycle. This suggests that demand for new housing is not lost because of election uncertainty rather it gets pushed out to the following year as long as the economy stays on track.  While this is definitely not your typical election year (understatement of the century) experts believe that once the election is over we could see the real estate market perform even better in the months following.  Its All About Consumer Confidence The economy is tightly connected to politics and real estate is tightly connected to the economy.  While many other parts of our economy have made a slow and steady recovery the housing markets rebound was miraculous stunning even housing market experts.  The housing recovery has been nothing short of remarkable. The expectation was that housing would be crushed. It wasfor about two monthsand then it came roaring back said Ali Wolf Chief Economist for Meyers Research.  A big piece of this puzzle is consumer confidence. Low-mortgage rates have continued to drive once-in-a-lifetime affordability for homeowners and buyers have been more concerned about missing out on the deal of the century than anything else.  Therefore confidence in the real estate industry has remained relatively high driving a record number of buyers into the market and put us in a position to potentially outperform last years sales.  Bottom Line While our countrys overall economic state may be slowly but surely returning the presidential election may cause consumers to watch and wait in the weeks to come.  However as we saw with the pandemic the reward of locking in record-low mortgage rates also may continue to outweigh any consumer caution and drive buyers and sellers to act.  Plus low inventory and high buyer demand puts sellers in a very powerful position.  History suggests that a slowdown in the housing market is inevitable but this is definitely not your typical presidential election.

"AMERICA - THE GREAT BALANCER  This is the final installment of my series The History and Future of Nationalism. Please visit the website and click on the menu item to see previous installments.  ""Speak softly and carry a big stick - you will go far""  Theodore Roosevelt coined his famous maxim when Great Britain still dominated the world through its mastery of the seas and colonial empire. At the same time Roosevelt had the foresight to recognize the world was becoming increasingly multipolar with the United States Germany and Japan becoming regional hegemons in the Western Hemisphere Europe and Asia respectively. Both adroit diplomacy and a newly invigorated navy and armed forces would be necessary to preserve Americas national security and way of life in the coming new world order.  Today America fills the role of a great world power watching its influence wane in an increasingly multipolar and nationalistic world. This new world order consists not only of regional hegemons like China but also non-state actors as diverse as multinational corporations international non-profit advocacy groups and terrorist organizations. This proliferation of powerful actors and the variety of weapons available to them multiplies both the risk of conflict and the arenas in which conflict could occur. Wars can now be fought in outer space cyberspace and the trade and migration space. The US cannot waste its advantages in soft hard and economic power if it expects to remain secure and a beacon of freedom in this newly competitive world.  Speaking softly in such a world should be based on a policy of realism and restraint that respects other nations cultures and interests and vigorously defends our own only when it is directly in danger. The Center for Strategic and International Studiess recent paper Getting to Less surveys the various theories for achieving this two of which stand out  offshore balancing and command the commons. As further described in an article by Harvard Professor Stephen Walt offshore balancing relies on local powers in a region to keep the peace with America intervening only if they are incapable of opposing a potential hegemon. For example while it is in our direct national security interest to prevent Russian hegemony in Europe our commitment to NATO can be scaled back since Western Europe has the capacity to defend itself against Russian aggression. We would intervene only to counterbalance against any temporary Russian advantages echoing TRs balancing intervention in the Moroccan crisis. Realist offshore balancing would also call for military withdrawal from the Middle East though we would watch in splendid isolation in case any nation like Iran was achieving hegemony.  Meanwhile the big stick of a realist foreign policy would be the command the commons approach in which the US would defend itself and project power through dominance of the air space cyberspace and seas. Preserving the dollar as the worlds reserve currency would also help continue American hegemony in the commons of international finance. While America already is a great power in these arenas we will need more investment in our Air Force space program and cyberdefense capabilities to maintain it. Finally Roosevelts beloved navy would need to be expanded to the 350-ship size that has been talked about for years.  We must also remove important domestic barriers to a realist and restrained policy. American globalists have essentially privatized trade and immigration policy for their benefit and thus removed two important levers for responding peacefully to international conflict. This makes armed conflict more likely. Our lax immigration laws also make us vulnerable to the use of mass migration as a weapon (cf. Syria and Venezuela) and multilateral trade agreements prevent us from hardening our economy from trade disruptions and dumping. The federal government should reclaim power over these policies and return them for use in the national security toolbox.  While our military and economic power is formidable Americas soft power of freedom and democracy has always been our most effective form of international influence. Americas mere existence is a threat to regimes like China and Russia and we must remain strong to deter their attacks. However for America to be strong the American people must be strong. Dealing with our serious social and economic challenges by guaranteeing them a square deal in their lives would be the most effective way to assure our long-term security.  As a veteran himself Roosevelt was proud that no American soldier or sailor died during his presidency. He achieved this with a policy where diplomacy was primary and military intervention a rarity. In todays nationalist world a modern Rooseveltian foreign policy would draw on our historic respect for diversity to develop a policy of respect for the diversity of nations and confining conflict both peaceful and military to serious dangers to our national security and way of life. Multilateral organizations would be an important means but not an end in this strategy. A sustained commitment to such a realistic and restrained strategy would preserve our independence and freedom in the 21st century while maintaining America as a beacon of freedom and hope for the rest of the world.

Judi Bunner  Lets look at the failure of the Obama administration regarding jobs. 2.3 million manufacturing jobs were lost in the first 2 years of the Obama administration. Obama said manufacturing jobs were never coming back as he mocked Trump saying he would need a magic wand. At one point the unemployment rate for blacks was over 18%. He did manage to have one quarter with a 3.7% increase. Over his reign he added 12 million jobs. If you compare the last three years of Obama it looks as if he was doing as well as Trump but if you look at the job market the unemployment rate under Trump is very low which ironically means less people are searching for jobs and the greatest gain is in manufacturing.. Trump and his family have been constantly subjected to harassment lawsuits demands for his tax records supposedly for legislative purposes and attacks daily by the media. The economy was booming the unemployment was the lowest it has been in over 60 years the stock market hit an all time high. Due to the tax cuts and major de-regulations made by this administration corporation began bringing the jobs back. The Democrats tried every underhanded trick in the book including spying on the Trump campaign. Susan Rice wrote herself an e-mail on inauguration day saying Obama wanted things to be handled by the book in an effort to cover for him. Much to their chagrin they lost the election. Then they began trying to destroy any and all who they felt threatened to uncover their deceit including General Flynn. They set about trying to destroy Brett Kavanaugh with a vengeance using obvious false allegations from Ford at the urging of Feinstein and the Democrats to keep him from being seated on the Supreme Court. It was very disgusting to watch how desperate they were to discredit him for fear he may at some point overturn Roe v Wade. They have toyed with impeaching him saying he would always have an asterisks by his name. . Lets look at how this began. The Russian hoax began a month after Trump announced his candidacy in May 2015. Brennan Clapper and Obama concocted a scheme in the event they lost the election they could blame Russian interference. Obama did nothing until after Hillary lost and he waited until Dec. 29.2016 to oust Russian diplomats and close the consulate in San Francisco. The Ukraine courts said they had evidence those in power were actively trying to help Hillary win. The DNC and Hillary paid for a fake dossier that started the Mueller investigation. The final report did not prove quid pro quo. All the while Biden admitted he extorted Ukraine by withholding funds until they fired the prosecutor who was investigating his drug addict son when he was VP. He bragged about it in a video. On to the Horowitz report that found 161 errors and uncovered corruption in the top ranks of the FBI though only 6 were considered important. The unconstitutional impeachment proceedings soon followed. Once again the Democrats failed to prove the charges. Last but certainly not least the media and the Democrats said they would rather have a recession than see Trump re-elected. Then as if by magic their wishes came true and we have a pandemic. We are forced to close down the country which caused tremendous economic repercussions. The Democrats cant let a crisis go to waste so they decide to extort the president by including irrelevant items in the first aid package. They included an additional $600 for those unemployed to ensure these people would not go back to work because they were making more staying at home. All the while the businesses where they were employed were and are closing their doors forever for lack of workers.,political,Facebook
"Yes it was first posted 3 years ago Knowledge page 1  Everyone I meet today seems to know everything about everything and I am humbled there is so much for me to know that I will probably die knowing nothing. There is an irony in this. I have spent years trying to learn to explore the world the economy the politics the history you name it and it seems like all I needed to do was to watch TV  some news or get on a smart phone and read some memes.  Such is life.  Time and again here and there I have argued that there is no ""free media"" that we select the news that we want to hear provided us by the people with real money to form and to control our opinions (minds). If one is not broadly informed and aware heor she becomes a victim of the brainwash that is mass produced to cultivate opinions favored by the entity that sponsors the program. So we actually don't form our own opinions but regurgitate what has been put into our heads. Earlier today I posted a meme that the past has no guide for the future but somethings from the past do hold true. There has been a common refrain that the book ""1984"" was not a guide but if you watch closely it is being used today to govern the masses. In this age of brainwashing through the mass media there is another guide to personal development. In 380BC  in his book ""The Republic"" Plato writes a chapter "" allegory of the cave"" that is so pertinent to the human condition today. We have come to believe that what we (know) see is all the reality there is which in fact is a lie. To keep this short and to save you the trouble I have link here you can watch. If you are looking for reality you will not find it in the news we must learn more we must learn about other things other opinions other facts to actually get a feel for the reality there is much more to the truth and the facts  Let's talk.

The long and short of this is that rates potentially will rise very soon. If you have thought about refinancing or buying and think rates are going to drop again. This could be the bottom and now is the time. How can I help?!!!  Longer-term interest rates including mortgage rates jumped earlier this year as vaccinations began and the government pushed more fiscal stimulus into the economy. In the past few months mortgage rates have moved within a very narrow range. While the Fed has not yet laid out specific plans with respect to tapering their Treasury and MBS purchases the changes in their forecasts for the economy and for their rate target suggests that tapering is close at hand. As a result mortgage rates are likely primed to move at least somewhat higher.,political,Facebook
ECONOMIC RECOVERY POST-COVID The solutions of economic recovery are lying right under our noses with knowledge expertise technology and research all present right here in Maine. The solutions all lead straight back to impeccable environmental stewardship. At our own flagship university the University of Maine the Advanced Structures and Composites Center has engineered composite floating offshore wind turbine hulls which could produce 156 gigawatts of energy per year within 10 years -- more than $20 million of annual revenue at today's market value free energy to Maine residents (through tax rebates or possibly a dividend disbursement similar to the Alaska Permanent Fund) and thousands of new jobs. A Katahdin North Woods National Park would result in more than $100 million per year injected into Maine's economy and up to 6000 new jobs in the first 10 years 10000 in the first 20. In a post-Covid-19 world the environment will be an even greater tourism and recreation attraction than ever before.

"MODERN MONETARY THEORY: MISREPRESENTED ONCE AGAIN  Recently on a Bloomberg financial podcast an executive level employee at J.P. Morgan stated he did not believe in Modern Monetary Theory (MMT). MMT is a controversial monetary theory which offers a description of monetary operations which challenge orthodox economic and financial thinking. Within current MMT reasoning there is a belief there is room for fiscal expansion which when coordinated with the Nation's central bank--the Federal Reserve (FED) will enable public investment in human and physical capital i.e. infrastructure without inflationary consequences. The J.P. Morgan executive argued that in order for MMT to succeed that it would also have to fail: that to accumulate the debt which he implies is acceptable to MMT for public investment then even if the investment proved good for the economy the accumulated debt would then tank the economy.  It was the strangest comment that one could expect from an investment banker and it also misrepresented MMT views. First from an investment banker perspective it is strange to state that debt issuance condemns an institution to failure. Bankers afterall are peddlers of private sector debt issued on the belief that the gains from private investment will generally exceed the cost of capital. Government debt issued in order to facilitate productive investment: physical and human likewise has the potential to create long term gains in the economy which exceed the cost of capital. So it was strange to hear an investment banker ignore the growth potential associated with public debt issuance which finances physical and human capital investment: the type of investment promoted within the MMT framework.  The MMT public sector investment portfolio would include such things as green energy investment in education and most importantly a federal job guarantee program which would offer a job to anyone who seeks a job at a livable wage with health and child care benefits--a near full employment program.  A legitimate concern here should not be the level of debt so long as the associated funds are directed into productive investment but the concern should be the potential inflationary impact of large scale investment which creates individual earnings not yet matched by an increase in the provision of consumer goods and services. The temporary mismatch between increased earnings from new investment and the availability of goods and services may create short to medium term inflationary pressures in these consumer markets. One market concern undoubtedly is the belief that once inflation begins it feeds on itself into an upward spiral of increased inflationary pressure which can only be resolved through monetary and fiscal tightenings i.e. an induced recession.  It is not clear to me whether MMT has adequately addressed the short term inflationary impact of broad public infrastructure investment. MMT definitely recognizes that Federal spending is limited by potential inflationary effects of Federal spending and it seems they differ from the broader market participants in their view of the size and scope of available resources which can be put to work before real resource restraints create inflationary pressure. In other words it seems that MMT believes there currently exists greater slack in the economy than the broader market participants believe and it also seems that MMT believes that increased productive capacity which meets consumer demand can come online rather quickly in order to thwart these inflationary pressures. The latter view is undoubtedly challenged in a trade restricted environment.  It appears that MMT takes the long view and the bigger point is that green energy will eventually be a more efficient source of energy while high tech education combined with liberal arts training will make us both more productive and better citizens. The federal jobs programs will assist in the development of work skills which will further enhance national productivity. Debt used to finance such activity would be a very good use of debt and will not inflict damage on the national economy but rather will enhance long term growth in a noninflationary manner.  Much of the above discussion is premised on a misrepresentation of the MMT view on public debt. The J.P. Morgan Executive's view is premised on the idea that Federal deficit spending must be funded with debt. This is not the MMT view. Federal debt issuance is a policy option not a requirement for deficit spending.  The MMT view is that a sovereign monetary authority such as the U.S. which creates its own free floating currency creates money when it spends and destroys money through taxation and borrowing. Money creation and money destruction need not be equal. Spending need not be fully funded but only 'funded' to an extent and in a manner which prevents inflation in the goods services and asset markets. In other words deficit spending need not be funded with debt: the money for deficit spending is created through the act of spending. An equivalent debt issuance merely destroys an equal amount of money thereby neutralizing any inflationary impact of the deficit spending. Debt issuance money destruction is a mere tool for inflation control and for other convenient purposes i.e. private portfolio investment stability store of value interest rate targeting . . . .  Furthermore the Executive's narrative ignored debt management techniques discussed elsewhere on this Page (""Federal Debt Revisited"" scroll 5 essays down) such as debt extinguishment the Platinum coin idea which grew out of the 2011 budget ceiling crisis taxation of the well-off rather than borrowing from the well-off and Federal Reserve perpetual holdings of Treasury debt on its balance sheet--which is costless to the U.S. taxpayer. The brief discussion of MMT was yet another false representation of MMT views.  Generally it is wise to dismiss about 85% of corporate reporting on MMT views. Most commentators have not seriously examined MMT; others are in no mood to change the status quo. Large capital interests in the private sector simply do not want to concede additional space to the public sector regardless of the long term growth potential associated with public sector investment.  Undoubtedly the Nation's long term productivity potential would be greatly enhanced by the above public sector investments. But in the long run the current investment class won't be here. Perhaps this is part of the problem. The other part lies in the short term investment horizon of private sector firms responding to investor demands for short term profits which overall does not align with the long term investment objectives of the Federal government.

"THE LONG ARC OF RACISM  The insurrection by anti-government white nationalists on January 6th was 12 years in the making beginning with Obama's election in 2008.  Americans spent the beginning of the 2000s focusing their hatred on Muslims launching two ill-fated wars in an attempt to reassert its global dominance. As America's military might floundered in the Middle East its economy imploded after decades of stagnant wages conspicuous consumption and deregulation came home to roost. Then the unthinkable happened.  A Black man was elected president.  Racists rallied to the call.  Obama was surely not a legitimate president. He wasn't even a legitimate American!  Tea parties gathered decorum was cast aside (e.g. ""You lie!"" yelled at the State of the Union) and fragile white Americans were soon able to excuse their every failure and soothe every insecurity as the consequence of Obama's election.  The Republican party rallied the support of ""angry white men"" to help ""keep them in business"" and Donald Trump rode that wave of amorphous bigoted ignorant rage to the White House.  White nationalists had their president and he considered them ""very fine people."" The arc of American decay that Republicans often infer began with the Voting Rights Act and hastened thereafter had reached its nadir with Obama's election and Trump was finally making America great again (wink wink).  But his God-given presidency was about to be cut short by of all things Black voters in cities like Atlanta and Philadelphia who dared exercise the very rights that brought the cultural decline of America nearly 60 years ago.  Despite weeks of calling for violence Trump's white nationalist supporters were welcomed to Washington DC in a manner that stood in undeniably stark contrast to that which Black Lives Matter protesters received 6 months earlier. Where BLM were met by the National Guard in tactical gear on the steps of the Lincoln Monument Trump's racist insurrectionists were allowed to run wild all the way into the Capitol and onto the floor of the Senate.  Americans soothed themselves saying ""this isn't who were are!""  Yes it is.  It is who we have always been.  Angry.  Fragile.  Entitled.  Violent.  and  Racist.

"Here are the Top 13 Bipartisan reasons Newsom should be Recalled... but there are so many more ....  1.Nursing Home Covid Deaths Gavin ordered ill equipped long term nursing home care facilities to accept covid positive elderly patients which spread and devastated the nursing home care population in our state. 2. His Support of Prop 47 Not only did he support Prop 47 but while mayor he appointed the co-author of prop 47 George Gascon to DA in San Francisco. This is the bill that decriminalized breaking and entering theft property crimes public urination and defecation in the street. 3. Wild fire and Destruction His policies on forestry management or ""lack there of"" has let to massive wildfire destruction over and over again. The fact that California stopped practices like clearing brush thinning the trees and controlled burnings in so much of our forests only made matters worse. 4. Government made drought Californians and businesses are perennially plagued with water shortages caused by man not the weather. Gavin Newsome refuse to build more water storage like reservoirs or dams and trillions of gallons of water each year are directed toward the ocean. He has also openly supported the decommission of four hydro-electric dams near the Kern river. This will shorten the supply of both water and electricity in California and costs will continue to go up. 5.The Self-Imposed Energy Crisis California of course has abundant energy. Yet California cannot reliably provide energy to the tens of millions of Californians and their businesses. Power shutdowns are a regular part of life and its biggest energy provider PG&E has warned shutdowns will be a fact of life for a decade. Newsome is nowhere to be found on spearheading an effort to have industry leaders from around the country get together to solve this problem that has costs so many jobs. Instead in his tiresome fashion Newsome blames others. 6 .The Unemployment Fraud Scandal The largest fraud scandal in the history of any state is exploding in California. Apparently controls were so lax that COVID-related benefits (over $100 billion in total) were paid to prisoners people out of state and fraudsters. 7.Job Losses and Highest Tax in the Nation. Tesla Hewlett-Packard Oracle are only a few of the major businesses leaving the state due to expensive unnecessary regulation and over taxation taking thousands of jobs with them which is also devastating to our economy. 8. California Budget Crisis California leads all states in debt and infrastructure problems. California is unsustainable because of its pension and other public debt. Newsom has done nothing to stave off the impending fiscal nightmare other than making it worse through higher spending. Lets not forget the purchase of 420 million masks to the tune of $316 million from a Chinese contractor. 9. Sanctuary state status and failing to enforce immigration. Gavin endorsed laws that favor illegal immigrants over that of our own citizens. Many illegal immigrants working under the table also take advantage of social welfare programs here in California where there are loop holes a plenty. 10. Hypocrisy and Sheer Arrogance While Gavin Newsom imposed rules against restaurant dining he was caught not wearing a mask not properly social distanced eating indoors at an expensive restaurant in California called the French Laundry. Also While his mandate that bars restaurants and Breweries remained closed He kept his own winery called Plump Jack open. While he supported public school closures which were harmful to so many children in California He made the choice to place his kids at an in person private school. Last but not least there is Newsom's $312 million Dollar mask deal to buy masks from a well-connected Chinese company while there were struggling impacted business here in our own state that could have been contracted to produce face masks. And To top that off I heard the masks from China failed to pass the federal safety certifications. What a waste. 11. Closure of churches during COVID which is a direct violation of the First Amendment. The Supreme Court ruled against Newsomes ruling. 12. The Homeless Crisis- blatant disregard of the problem. Instead of working toward a viable solution he spends millions on trailers and tents. 13. Releasing 76000 inmates - including violent and repeat offenders because of crowded conditions and/or COVID.",political,Facebook
"MODERN MONETARY THEORY AND INFLATION  Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) offers a description of monetary operations which has drawn increased national attention over the past two decades. The proponents of MMT are mercilessly maligned by orthodox economists the press and others; their views are often badly distorted in various press publications.  MMT puts forth the idea that monetary sovereign nations: nations with their own free floating currencies are not budget constrained in their spending practices. Sovereign nations such as the U.S. which create their own currencies cannot possibly be constrained by funding issues as they create their own currency and there is no operational limit on the amount of currency which they can produce. There are practical inflationary constraints on a sovereign monetary authority's production of money but funding constraints are self-imposed and do not reflect the ability of a sovereign monetary nation to spend as appropriate on a nation's needs.  The mechanics for MMT go like this. When the federal government spends money enters into a checking account. This spending action has in effect and in reality based on definitional categories of money actually produced new money. When the federal government collects taxes or borrows it destroys money: it takes money out of the economy. There is no natural law which states that federal expenditures must equal taxation and borrowing. In other words the Federal government need not fund federal deficit spending with debt. This is a policy choice. Households must match that which comes in with that which goes out but governments which create their own currencies are not likewise constrained. The truth of these statements is readily demonstrated through an examination of the U.S. colonial period during which colonial governments spent currencies into existence. The North's use of Greenbacks during the Civil War provides another example of this practice.  Excessive money creation without adequate money destruction i.e. taxation and borrowing will create inflation in the goods services and asset markets. MMTers readily acknowledge this point. Inflation occurs in the goods and services sectors when expenditures exceed productive capacity or in MMT words when the economy bumps up against real resource restraints. This makes perfect sense. This is also where MMT gets badly misrepresented in the press as economists financial analysts and others make the outrageous claim that MMT promotes the view that the federal government can endlessly spend without inflationary consequences. A recent opinion piece in The Hill (March 30 2021) stated: ""For those unaccustomed with MMT in essence it states that the U.S. government can print and spend money limitlessly."" This is not the MMT view and the promoters of such a view generally reveal their lack of serious study of MMT or worse MMT views are cynically misrepresented in an effort to impose discipline on federal government spending.  While on this topic we should not allow the current system to escape criticism on the inflation front. The system's dependence on unemployment underemployment and low wages in order to preserve price stability create other inflationary forces which generally go unrecognized. These unrecognized inflationary forces include police prisons the U.S. military and other unproductive activities which do not directly add to the production of goods and services. Much of the need or perceived need for these services can be directly linked to low income conditions in large segments of the U.S. population. The U.S. military is included here as it offers employment to impoverished workers and it is a necessary appendage to the competitive and inherently expansionary nature of the capitalist system.  The unemployed require state support and it is right to provide this support; but these unemployed labor earnings combined with earnings from labor and capital which result from the nation's roughly $730 billion military budget and additional large earnings from employment in prisons police forces and so forth: all of which adds nothing to the production of goods and services puts upward pressure on the prices of these goods and services. To date countervailing deflationary forces have hidden these inflationary costs. Without consideration of these inflationary forces we immediately go to wage gains as the source of inflationary pressure. As nice as it would be to see a military budget of zero one has to wonder about the deflationary impact of such a budget. Nonetheless a demilitarized world is a worthy goal and it would be better to direct soldiers into productive rather than destructive activities.  Part of MMT's theoretical framework is a full employment federal jobs program which guarantees employment to any willing participant at a respectable minimum wage along with healthcare and childcare services. MMT correctly perceives that one of the major problems with the free market economy is there is a constant pool of unemployed underemployed and low paid labor which damages both the individual and the broader national economy. Under the MMT scheme the wage in the job guarantee program would effectively set the national minimum wage. During expansionary times the private sector would bid labor out of the job program and during recessionary times labor would fall back into the job program. The job guarantee would moderate economic cycles and build a productive national workforce.  MMTers generally believe there is much available space for federal spending before real resource capacity is fully utilized--the point at which inflationary pressures begin to build. There are examples which back their view. Japan has struggled with deflationary pressures since the 1990s. During the past decade Japan has gone on a money creation binge which has resulted in a national debt to GDP ratio which approaches 240% more than double the U.S. ratio of debt to GDP. Yet Japan's inflation rate still hovers around zero. In the U.S. despite vigorous efforts to the contrary the nation's central bank the Federal Reserve has been unable to achieve a 2% inflation target. Both of these examples demonstrate the strong deflationary forces present in the global economy: this provides space for expanded money creation.  Would a federal full employment jobs program have a long term inflationary impact? It is difficult to say. MMTers say no. To me the answer is not so clear. What is clear however is that if a ""healthy"" non-inflationary economy is dependent as it has been during previous decades on a pool of unemployed underemployed and low wage workers then the economy is either flawed in its design or we are using a wrong set of measurements. Current accounting measures facilitate private sector measurements of profits and losses but fail to account for the broader social gains and losses associated with such activity. We all know that full employment is better than non full employment. Yet inflation measures which are important for money supply management purposes have dictated a near constant state of unemployment. The possible exception to this general rule is WWII which essentially amounted to a full employment federal jobs program.  If inflation measures and private firm accounting practices which prevent full employment violate that which we know to be true i.e. full employment is better than unemployment then it is time to create new measurements and accounting practices which better reflect the reality of what is happening in the broader national economy.  MMT offers accommodation to capitalist national economies with free floating sovereign currencies. Capitalists ought to embrace MMT ideas because capitalism will not survive its current form. If capitalism does not embrace necessary reform one variant of which MMT represents the other direction involves increasing social discontent oppression and violence. Few people capitalist or non capitalist want to wander down this path.  If the MMT plan were put into place and it were to prove unworkable due to inflationary pressures then either a new set of measurements and accounting practices should be developed which reflect the broader gains achieved through a guaranteed full employment program or the economy would need other radical restructuring which ensures a decent standard of living for all people.

"REVISITING AFGHANISTAN Part 1 I hope to and intend to write this over the next few nights this part 1 should only be considered an intro We are merely a month away from the 20th Anniversary of 9/11 tragedy. Another sad day that will live in infamy. With all the rhetoric in the aftermath  all the war talk in the liberal media from Time to WaPo and the rightwing talk radio chest beating I was against a war in Afghanistan it did not make military sense it was not about getting even and if it was not about a war against Islam as W proclaimed. What was it about. Over the last 15 plus years  I have made over 2500 posts on military peace war society religion economy morals and much more. My views are not secrets my views are not sacred but I will say that my comments are always well researched and thought through. One if my comments was why are we sending a two billion dollar bomber around the world to drop million dollar bombs on mud huts in a desert the only logical reply. We need to justify the existence of ""military Industrial complex"". We did not have a war with Afghanistan we did not have a war with Islam we needed to catch a criminal and bring him and his associates to justice this is why we have the NSA the CIA the FBI and the special forces. A military invasion an overthrow of a regime an attempt to root out an ideology was all unnecessary. Then when we got there the mission changed as it always does out of necessity to appear to be the good guys we did that in Vietnam too killing millions of locals and building schools and orphanages. Cute! We never really went to Afghanistan on a real mission and to achieve a goal the purpose was simple see if we can buy enough people to run the country for us so we could buy the raw materials (exotic metals) for our corporate owners. It was not really a ""war on terror"" as much as it was about securing the opium supplies yes. We killed hundreds of thousands with our drones most of innocent by standards and sometimes children we blew up schools weddings funerals and mosques sometimes we killed babies in their mothers arms while we looked for some suspected ""warlord"" by Afghan definition every land owner is also a warlord you didn't know that did you?

Liars Lie & Cheaters Cheat! We are terrified! (Share if you agree.) DA2020  Donald Trump  Trump admits he is undermining USPS to make it harder to vote by mail.  The president says he opposes providing additional money to the postal service to help it deliver mail-in ballots  The Guardian Sam Levine in New York  Last modified: Thu 13 Aug 2020 14.49 EDT  Donald Trump: If they dont get [extra funding for states and the USPS] that means you cant have universal mail-in voting because theyre not equipped to have it.  Donald Trump admitted on Thursday he opposed additional funding for the United States Postal Service (USPS) in order to make it more difficult to deliver mail-in ballots.  Trumps comments lend evidence for critics who say the president is deliberately trying to hamstring the USPS in advance of the November elections to help his re-election bid.  Trump said on Thursday that congressional negotiations over stimulus aid were held up in part because of Democratic proposals to provide $3.6bn to states to run elections and $25bn in aid to the postal service. The president who has falsely claimed that widespread mail-in voting will lead to fraud suggested that without the funding it would be harder to vote by mail.  They need that money in order to have the post office work so it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots Trump said in an interview with Fox Businesss Maria Bartiromo. If they dont get those two items that means you cant have universal mail-in voting because theyre not equipped to have it.  Congress has allocated just $400m to help states run elections a small fraction of the $4bn the Brennan Center for Justice estimates is needed this year. Many election officials are scrambling to figure out how they will run an election where there is expected to be an unprecedented level of mail-in and in-person voting. The lack of funding may already be having an effect; in Kentucky the states top election official said this week he did not support expanding mail-in voting for the fall because the state did not have the capacity to do so.  The presidents comments also come amid accusations that Louis DeJoy the new postmaster general and a major Republican donor is making cuts at the agency to intentionally slow down the mail. There are reports of severe mail delays in places across the country and the Washington Post and other news organizations published internal USPS documents last month saying there was a blanket ban on overtime and that workers were being told to leave mail behind if it will delay them on their routes. A USPS spokesman denied there was a blanket ban on overtime but did not address questions about whether employees were being told to leave the mail behind.  A slower mail service could have a big impact this fall because an unprecedented number of Americans are expected to vote by mail and many states require a ballot to arrive at an election office by election day regardless of when it was put in the mail in order to be counted. At least 65000 ballots were rejected during the 2020 primaries because they arrived too late.  If we dont make a deal that means they dont get the money. That means they cant have universal mail-in voting. They just cant have it. Sort of a crazy thing Trump said on Thursday.  Andrew Bates a spokesman for Joe Biden the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee said in a statement Trump was attacking the US economy and democracy.  The president of the United States is sabotaging a basic service that hundreds of millions of people rely upon cutting a critical lifeline for rural economies and for delivery of medicines because he wants to deprive Americans of their fundamental right to vote safely during the most catastrophic public health crisis in over 100 years he said.  USPS officials have not said they need additional funding to deliver mail-in ballots this fall. The Postal Service has ample capacity to deliver all election mail securely and on-time in accordance with our delivery standards and we will do so DeJoy said at a meeting of the USPS board of governors on Friday.  In a separate interview on Thursday Larry Kudlow the presidents top economic adviser dismissed efforts to make it easier to vote in negotiations over stimulus money.  So much of the Democratic asks are really liberal left wishlists he said. Voting rights aid to aliens and so forth. Thats not our game.,political,Facebook
"RANDOM PSYCHOLOGY 135 A It's been a few days since I wrote here last my son and one of my two daughters were home for the weekend a combination Father's day birthday and my son moving on to his first job after graduating college. So busy! Also I have been thinking about the end of the world as we have known for the past few centuries or the end of it all. We are going along happy go lucky ""climate change"" if it is real or not if it is man made or not can we slow it down or it is too late. Who knows right but we do know. Then there is the problem of pollution do we care? We are running out of clean water and other natural resources. Will Jesus come soon enough? We don't realize or we ignore the real problems we have. The truth is no matter who you are where you live country state nation does not matter we are affected equally as we near the end we are becoming more equal. I have a beef with everyone with humanity and its endless source of stupidity. I guess we have seen too many dystopian movies that we actually believe that we will survive the Armageddon. That with enough guns and food to live on for two or three years we will make it to the otherside. Talk about a dream. If you are a believer and truly believe in the 2d coming are you not a fool to think that you need guns after the rapture or food who are you going to leave it for? You can't take your guns and food to the heavens. May be you know that Jesus will have nothing to do with afterall He doesn't like your kind. Do you really want to survive a nuclear war? Even if you lived in a bunker you will die whenever you came out ar may the radiation will kill you inside your bunker. No good options there. All the current evidence shows that the climate change is real and it is accelerating faster than anyone predicted. What will the weather be like in any given location is unknown we may not even be able to grow crops as we are used to and where we are used to. Global population is decreasing slowly but it is it is also getting older far fewer younger people to care for the elderly. And of course when one is taking care of the elderly they are not producing thus earning wages and consuming so it slows down the economy. And our economy depends upon consumption which causes pollution which contributes to the climate change. Life is circles endless circles intertwined making a maze no one knows how to get out. So we are misled and misguided we are told to ignore reality  lest you start asking where to next? How do we get out of this maze? Don't ask go back to sleep. More will follow M. N.

GOD WON'T ACCEPT NOTHING LESS! PSALM 24:1-3 11/1/2021  PSALM 24:1-3 NIV - (1) The earth is the LORD's and the fullness thereof; the world and they that dwell therein. (2) For he hath founded it upon the seas and established it upon the floods. (3) Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? or who shall stand in his holy place?  Dont pray to Him last. Pray to Him first! Dont go to His word last go to His word first! Make God your first love instead of your second resort. We must take God off the shelf. We must make Him first! It seems like simple math when people say If I give less Ill keep more. But we have forgotten that it doesnt work that way in Gods economy. Today we want to look at the difference it makes when we view as the first in everything.  Many people acknowledge God but not necessarily first. And when we search the bible we will discover how God regularly demands to be first. The word first pops up a lot in scripture in relation to God and God literally audits His position in our lives. Why? Because He doesnt take our word for it. Just because we say He is first doesnt mean He buys it. He audits it to show us in what way we claim He is first. My brothers and sisters God cannot be second! God will let us know when He is not visibly and functionally when He is not in first place. Remember this He made everything therefore I want to be consulted First. I want to get my view point First. I want you to think how I feel about it First. He wants to be First in everything! We are Kingdom stewards. God owns everything and we are simply His faithful managers of His property. Our managerial status will be evaluated according to our time talent and treasures. Whatever you or we have it must be overseen by the owner of all. If you believe that something is yours then you are in conflict with the actual owner (PSALM 24:1-3). So the question you ask is Do we really treat Him second or worse? Lets refer to the scriptures to see what God has to say about such a question.  MALACHI 1:6-9  God tells the priest and Israelites (preachers and the congregation) you treat your Governor better than you treat me! Because you give me your left overs. God lets the people know He is insulted that He gets as The creator and owner that I get leftovers from you. Given who I am and my position! In fact He goes on in the same chapter and says I am a great King!  HAGGAI 1:4  God says youre building your house while my house lays in waste.  1 TIMOTHY 2:1  God wants us to communicate with Him first (Prayer). Dont pray after we have made a mess but pray first and watch the fruitful results.  PROVERBS 3:9-10  Honor the Lord with the first of your produce. The problem is simple. Many do not Honor Him. Therefore He becomes second in tithing and even offerings. Its not only the amount but will we give it first!  GENESIS 4:3-5  In worship what is God asking you for thats continues to be rejected because you me or we havent given Him what He asked for?  God even says make me first and see what I will do! But many do not understand the Spiritual to the Economic.  CONCLUSION: COLOSSIANS 1:15-19 NLT  (15) Christ is the visible image of the invisible God. He existed before anything was created and is supreme over all creation (16) for through him God created everything in the heavenly realms and on earth. He made the things we can see and the things we cant see such as thrones kingdoms rulers and authorities in the unseen world. Everything was created through him and for him. (17) He existed before anything else and he holds all creation together. (18) Christ is also the head of the church which is his body. He is the beginning supreme over all who rise from the dead. So he is first in everything. That means there shall be no category in our lives where He is not FIRST!!!!! If you want to experience Freedom give God His first! He gave all first to us so that we could be free and He is not going to accept sloppy seconds from NOBODY!,political,Facebook

We have remained quiet during the past few months regarding the upcoming referendum vote on 5/4. But this is one of the main reasons to VOTE NO. The school board and the admin once again dont get it. The pandemic has crippled the local economy and has forced the citizens of Elkhart to look to other alternatives to pay their own bills not figure out how to help the school system bail out their own mismanagement of funds. The entire school board should be replaced and Thalheimer should step down. Thalheimer failed ECS during the last referendum and will again.. At what point does the leader realize he cant lead..  Read and digest the paragraph below...  Imagine if they had cut expenses closed buildings and overall right sized in the past few years after the last referendum defeat. Then this year came to the taxpayers and said We have done everything we can we need help! Would that feel different? Well that did NOT happen. They continued to grow build and fatten up. Now they just think they deserve more of our hard earned money. It is like someone used to taking extravagant vacations eating out regularly etc losing their job maxing out their credit cards to maintain their lifestyle expecting someone to just give them more money so they can maintain that lifestyle. No self awareness or change in their own behavior. It is disgusting!  The reality is that they didnt and wont do this because of their arrogance.

Every person I talk to in Cleveland Heights wants the people of our city to have a greater say in what our city does and how it goes about doing it.  So when we talk about increasing inclusion and community engagement we need to also talk about our citys processes for making decisions.  Here's why:  If people are only allowed to give input at the final stages of any given project  when almost all of the decision making has already happened  when making design changes would mean adding months to the project because planners and developers would need to start over  when our city officials feel compelled to approve a project because its too much trouble and cost to start over so as to accommodate our residents needs then lets be honest:  OUR PEOPLE ARENT REALLY ABLE TO GIVE INPUT.  We need processes that bring in community voices in the BEGINNING stages of every project and then keep them looped in throughout. We need to establish what aspects of decision making and design are being done at which stages and we need to conduct sincere good-faith outreach to bring in the appropriate stakeholders at those moments when their contributions need to be taken into consideration.  This may sound like a lot of work but it doesnt have to be if we create structures to access and streamline communication with different groups.  If we create a citywide NEIGHBORHOOD COUNCIL with representatives from as many neighborhoods in the city as we can get we would have a structure in place to set up conversations with surrounding residents about a project being developed in their area.  If we create a BUSINESS COUNCIL our business community could speak in a unified voice or could speak on behalf of nearby business districts. We could easily reach out to them early to ensure that all decisions being made have either a positive or neutral impact on our local economy.  If we create a SUSTAINABILITY COMMITTEE we would have clearly defined sustainability objectives (not simply a vague commitment with a few general guidelines) along with plans parameters goalposts and metrics that can guide development decisions at every stage of the process to make sure all of our development upholds our citys values and goals.  INSTEAD what we have are critically important decisions being made with little to no community input plans being approved in meetings that are not widely announced to the residents so they can tune in and public uproar at the final stages of projects with city officials being left to decide whether they bring a giant project months or perhaps years in the making to a screeching halt or they set aside the chorus of resident voices and move forward.  This process is not working for us.  We CAN do things differently. But it will take work. And we need our leadership fully committed to the vital importance of building long-lasting structures for community inclusion and engagement.  This is why Im running for mayor of Cleveland Heights.,political,Facebook
Bangor Daily News has reported that Maine is facing an estimated $1.4 billion budget shortfall over the next 3 years. How should we address these shortfalls? Maybe with cuts or tax increases? I am confident that the way our state budget has grown over the last two years there are areas we can cut and preserve the vital programs that our Maine families depend on. As for tax increases you cannot stimulate our economy by increasing taxes and putting money from your pocket into state coffers. Any tax increase would further delay our economic recovery and should not be considered. Our goal must be to get our economy up and running as it was before the pandemic. Returning our state's economy is the clearest path to saving our state from economic disaster. This would also help the estimated 14000 Mainers that lost health coverage between February and May amid pandemic job losses. It is very important for the businesses and citizens of this state see a consistent direction that the state is headed. The people of this state deserve to see a plan for reopening that is based on science and not inconsistent arbitrary directions that seem to have no economic considerations at all. Unfortunately it is impossible to reach zero risk. We all bare the responsibility of keeping ourselves and loved ones safe.

"Let's talk about... GREATNESS. Particularly America's greatness.  What makes a country great? For most of us many factors might come into play such as the country being exceptional in terms of:   geographic expanse and resources;  population;  military power and victories;  wealth productivity and an ever increasing standard of living;  leadership in technology and innovation;  global political and cultural leadership and influence;  health happiness and quality of life;  and a commitment to justice equality and human rights.  In his famous scene from the pilot of ""The Newsroom"" Jeff Daniels as Will McAvoy explained why America was once a great country: We stood up for what was right. We fought for moral reason. We passed laws struck down laws for moral reason. We waged wars on poverty not on poor people. We sacrificed we cared about our neighbors we put our money where our mouths were and we never beat our chest. We built great big things made ungodly technological advances explored the universe cured diseases and we cultivated the worlds greatest artists AND the worlds greatest economy. We reached for the stars acted like men. We aspired to intelligence we didnt belittle it. It didnt make us feel inferior.  In so many of these areas America has witnessed a steep decline over the past four years. America's loss of international prestige is perhaps most pronounced. America has become both a laughing stock and pariah to much of the rest of the civilized world. Our allies no longer trust us. Our passports are not accepted around the world due to America's failure to deal with COVID-19 in a competent manner. Our adversaries view America politically as a joke led by a clown-in-chief whose favor can be curried through empty praise.  The net worth of our wealthiest citizens continues to increase while the vast majority find themselves in the midst of a recession that grows more dire with each passing day. Many are unable to pay their rent. We see people losing their jobs and businesses on a scale not seen since the great depression.  America's educational system has dramatically failed when it has produced a populace in which a substantial minority rejects not only science but also empirical reality while choosing to live in a world of ""alternative facts."" Meanwhile that same segment of the populace praises or seems unable to recognize the incredible risks posed by an elected official exhibiting persistent abusive psychopathic and sociopathic behaviors while having control of our nuclear codes.  America has culturally failed when a substantial portion of our population thinks it is just fine to be led by a: serial sexual abuser; a credibly accused rapist; a man who has told 20000+ documented lies as POTUS; who saturates his presidency with corruption and surrounds himself with criminals; who sacrilegiously uses religion to play people for suckers while failing to live by any of the values of the religion he pretends to support; and who acts in a manner consistent with his being a Russian asset.  Our health care system is for the average citizen one of the very worst in the developed world. And it continues to deteriorate in the face of an abject lack of leadership.  Our system of justice on the federal level has become a department of injustice that more and more often engages in the corrupt enforcement of order against those who might oppose POTUS and for the furthering of POTUSs personal interests.  Our level of national debt poses an insane liability that cripples America's future.  Our failure to address the risks from climate change fuels ongoing natural disasters on a scale never seen before while presaging catastrophic scenarios for our future and the futures of our children.  By any rational perspective America is no longer a great country. In fact America shows every sign of being a country on the brink of potential collapse. The end of America at least of an America that is a secular capitalistic representative democracy could be upon us within a period of months.  And yet...  The Trump campaign slogan over the past four years has explicitly been centered on promises to ""Make America Great Again"" and ""Keep America Great."" And from the point of view of many of the President's supporters they believe that Trump has set a course that has been and continues to be successful in making America great.  How do we resolve this discrepancy?  The only way to explain it is to realize that for the segment of the population that supports Trump an American return to greatness is not primarily measured by ANY of the metrics I listed above. The only explanation that fits the actual facts is if for these people America's return to greatness is defined as being a society in which white Christian males once again hold a position of privilege. If we define greatness in this manner then all of America's failures I mentioned above become either irrelevant or actually supportive of their vision for making America great again.  When we wonder why some of our acquaintances are not outraged by things like blatant racism human rights abuses corruption submission to Putin and so many of the other daily horrors Trump that has unleashed upon America it is because they often see these things as positives not negatives. They either explicitly support it; they don't care; they completely tune it out so they can't see it; or they decide to embrace alternative facts so they can pretend it isn't happening.  We won't defeat this challenge by changing minds at least not in the short term. We will only win by making sure that the majority -- the vast majority who are decent and good and just -- recognize the dangers and use their votes to help us address them by making drastic changes in both the Presidency and the Senate.  If that happens there is a chance a fighting chance that the dominoes could start falling again in a direction that will lead to an America that is greater than any America of the past. It will require us to face extraordinary cultural economic and environmental challenges with every bit of ingenuity that America can muster.  But if we are determined you and I together can make it happen.  --Cliff",political,Facebook
The Earnfare Program which is under the Supervisors management is another program that I pursued for Harrisburg Township which basically states that if a SNAP (food stamp) recipient is willing to work out the value of their food stamps first by performing community work they can then perform additional community work to earn federal Earnfare Grant money. Federal funding for this program is funneled through the Illinois Department of Human Services. Its the Supervisors decision not a requirement to pursue and participate in an Earnfare Grant. Harrisburg Township did not incur any additional administrative costs with the Earnfare Program because I added these additional duties onto my existing general assistance staff.  I decided to pursue the Earnfare Grant for a number of reasons.  (1) I wanted to help some of the less fortunate people of Harrisburg who have become unemployed by giving those individuals who are willing to work an opportunity to provide some additional income for their families from an available federal funding source.  (2) Provide opportunities to put some of these Harrisburg residents back into the permanent work force.  (3) Our local governmental units and non-for-profit organizations that provide work sites use this no cost Earnfare Program labor to accomplish tasks that they could not afford otherwise.  (4) By competing for and being awarded an Earnfare Grant each year $248000 of federal money will be spent and put into circulation in Harrisburg each year helping our local economy.  Your vote and support will be appreciated on Tuesday April 6th. You can vote early at the Saline County Courthouse from 8am to 4pm Monday thru Friday. Thanks Danny Clayton.,political,Facebook
"BEFORE EMBRACING AMERICA-FIRST AGENDA DAVID PERDUE WAS AN OUTSOURCING EXPERT  (Share if you believe that Georgians should know the sad truth about their Senator DA2020)  Mr. Perdue who faces one of two runoff elections in Georgia that will determine control of the Senate built a business record that shifted manufacturing and jobs overseas.  By Stephanie Saul Richard Fausset and Michael LaForgia  Jan. 1 2021 Updated 1:24 p.m. ET  The biographical video from Senator David Perdues first campaign in 2014 celebrated a narrative arc that many fellow Georgians either related to or have aspired to: the story of a humble boy from rural America whose hard work catapulted him into a global business career navigating free markets and faraway lands all the while gathering stores of wisdom and wealth.  The embrace of global commerce has been a hallmark of modern Georgia showcased in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics dissected by the novelist Tom Wolfe and promoted by among others Mr. Perdues Nafta-loving cousin Sonny Perdue governor from 2003 to 2011. Three years later in his maiden run for office David Perdue would boast of his international experience as a consultant and chief executive while speaking to a gathering of Republicans in Bibb County close to his middle Georgia hometown.  Theres only one candidate in this race thats ever lived outside the United States Mr. Perdue said. How can you bring value to a debate about the economy unless you have any understanding about the free-enterprise system and what it takes to compete in the global economy?  Now facing one of a pair of Jan. 5 runoff elections in Georgia that will determine control of the Senate Mr. Perdue has continued to make his global business experience the essence of his brand. But that has highlighted the contradictions that emerge  in his career and in his character but also in his party and his region  as he embraces the populist America-first strains of Trumpism.  The man who has lately voiced support for some of President Trumps signature tariffs built his career as an unapologetic free-trading practitioner of the outsourcing arts. As a top executive at companies including Reebok Sara Lee and Dollar General he was often deeply involved in the shift of manufacturing and jobs to low-wage factories in China and other Asian countries.  A review of that business record shows a man who achieved significant successes making millions managing complex periods of corporate growth and change and creating domestic jobs particularly at Dollar General. But there were also disappointments like the failed trucking business he ran with Sonny Perdue and his fruitless effort to rescue a company called Pillowtex that brought heartbreak to a North Carolina mill town. And while the senator often speaks of having led the Reebok turnaround as president of the companys flagship brand in the early 2000s he moved on from the company after a rival who today questions Mr. Perdues contribution to the turnaround was installed above him.  The man who spent much of his life broadening his horizons took to the stage at a Trump rally in Macon before Election Day and mocked Senator Kamala Harriss first name mispronouncing it with an exaggerated stumble that to critics amounted to crude racism. His campaign has called it an innocent mispronunciation.  The man who dons a faded denim jacket to reinforce his connection to everyday Georgians has a record of aloofness with an aversion to holding town hall meetings and a thin skin for tough questions. Now he has chosen a further withdrawal declining to participate in additional debates after one in which his Democratic opponent Jon Ossoff called him a crook for his prolific stock-trading while in the Senate.  Mr. Perdue did not respond to requests to be interviewed for this article. In response to written questions his campaign issued a statement that said in part Throughout his four decades working in the real world before being elected to the Senate David Perdue led American companies that saved and created tens of thousands of American jobs.  As when he first ran for office six years ago Mr. Perdue who is 71 regularly invokes those decades in business to style himself the ultimate Washington outsider though it was his cousin the former governor who gave him his entree to politics and helped nurture his ascent.  Taking aim at his 33-year-old opponent who runs a London-based documentary film company and has never held public office Mr. Perdues campaign has fixed on a $1000 payment from a Hong Kong media company to charge that Mr. Ossoff had a two-year working relationship with the Chinese Communist Party.  In its statement to The New York Times most of which dwelled on Mr. Ossoff the Perdue campaign called it ridiculous to compare the senators leadership in American companies with Jon Ossoffs foreign-owned company with shady ties to the Chinese government. (Mr. Ossoffs spokeswoman dismissed that claim as one of the most laughable smear campaigns in Georgia history.)  Mr. Perdues campaigns biographical video meanwhile has been refreshed for 2020. Edited out is a section that showed the senator posing with his wife on Chinas Great Wall.  From a Watermelon Patch to the World Mr. Perdue grew up in Warner Robins a small city about 100 miles south of Atlanta home to Robins Air Force Base. Airmen coming and going from foreign deployments connected the city to the wider world.  But life could still move to rural rhythms. Mr. Perdue traces his roots back to nearby Bonaire a farming community where Perdues settled in the early 1800s. Mr. Perdue recalls picking watermelons on a family-owned farm alongside Sonny who would become Mr. Trumps agriculture secretary in 2017.  While farming was a family pursuit Mr. Perdues parents followed a different path  education. David Perdue Sr. eventually became county schools superintendent.  Mr. Perdue would later go on to extol his fathers leadership in desegregating the countys schools but the historical record provides a different picture revealing the school system employed delay tactics until the N.A.A.C.P. sued and a court ordered it to comply.  The future senator graduated from high school in 1968 two years before the schools were fully integrated. Standout student varsity athlete and class president he was awarded a coveted appointment to the Air Force Academy.  David has those personal traits that cause him to be recognized as a person of worth his high school principal Milton Sutherlin wrote in a recommendation letter. His character is that always of a gentleman and he holds high those Christian ideals that speak well of his home training his school and his community.  But while the Air Force would prove a good fit for his cousin Sonny who served three years and was promoted to the rank of captain it was not so for David. He received Bs and Cs in a brief stint at the academy and by early 1969 let it be known that he wanted out.  I have realized that I have made a mistake and I do not want this type of career he wrote in January 1969 to Jack Brinkley the congressman who had sponsored him. His plan was to attend the Georgia Institute of Technology and try to play basketball.  His basketball career never materialized but Mr. Perdue would earn undergraduate and masters degrees at Georgia Tech. And over the next three decades he would position himself on the winning side of a seismic economic shift sweeping the South.  A Global Man of the New South Increasingly and inexorably the regions apparel and textile industry was turning to foreign contractors to manufacture its products. The disruption which meant thousands of layoffs for low-skilled workers in Southern mill towns was Mr. Perdues ticket to the world. He became an expert in outsourcing.  I spent most of my career doing that he would later say in a deposition.  His apprenticeship in outsourcing began while he was still in school. In 1972 he joined Kurt Salmon Associates a consulting company that had earned its reputation sending bright young engineers into Southern clothing factories to solve technical problems and boost efficiency. The company had a large Atlanta office and by the 1970s was aspiring to a more-global footprint.  The city was too. Born as a regional railroad hub Atlanta had begun adding international flights to its growing airport creating yet more opportunities for a metropolis that had already rocketed past its Southern rivals fueled by relentless civic boosterism and a reputation for racial moderation.  William Sand an engineer who worked in the Atlanta office with Mr. Perdue recalled that in the 1970s as Southern factories were beginning to close new ones were opening in Mexico and Asia. Kurt Salmon he said became experts at helping companies source product from overseas.  Mr. Perdue left in 1984 and worked at a few other places before ending up at Sara Lee which was best known for its baked goods but was also an apparel manufacturer. He was hired in 1992 to open a headquarters in Hong Kong where he lived for two years establishing operations throughout Asia from the ground up he would later say.  The ripple effects reached home. In 1994 the company eliminated thousands of jobs including 230 at its Spring City Knitting plant in Cartersville Ga. Most of the workers were women who earned $4.25 an hour sewing garments.  By that time Mr. Perdue was globe-trotting with yet another company Haggar Clothing which had chosen him to lead its international operation with one aim  increasing foreign sourcing. Within three years he had done just that boosting international production from 60 percent to 75 percent. As company plants were closed in the United States workers in Mexico performed the job for $1.50 an hour.  By 1998 Mr. Perdue was headed to Reebok which ultimately promoted him to lead its main division as it forged licensing deals with the National Football League and the National Basketball Association. Major league teams with their star power and marquee players burnished Reeboks cachet leading to its acquisition by Adidas in 2005. The manufacturing of most of the companys products was outsourced primarily to China and elsewhere in Asia.  The 2014 video produced by Mr. Perdues Senate campaign  in which he discusses licensing agreements  portrays him as the architect of Reeboks turnaround. Even in the wake of improvements in the companys business though Reeboks chairman Paul Fireman passed over Mr. Perdue for promotion to the companys No. 2 job.  In December 2001 the company announced that Mr. Perdue who as head of the Reebok brand had reported directly to Mr. Fireman would instead report to Jay Margolis who had formerly headed other brands for the company but was suddenly named chief operating officer.  Paul Fireman decided he wanted one guy to run it all from a C.O.O. point of view said Kenneth Watchmaker Reeboks chief financial officer until 2006. Thats where the two of them competed and Jay got the nod and David left after a period of time.  Mr. Margolis says that he and Mr. Fireman actually pushed out Mr. Perdue who has characterized his departure from Reebok as voluntary. I look back on David. He couldnt make decisions. He was so indecisive he couldnt move the product forward Mr. Margolis said.  As for the licensing deals Mr. Margolis said those were the brainchild of Mr. Fireman.  Mr. Fireman reached by phone said I dont remember firing him. He added: Im not challenging Jays recollection; I just dont remember myself.  Mr. Fireman did not address a question about the extent to which Mr. Perdue was involved in turning around the brands. A long time has passed since then he said. David was a good solid employee for the four or five years he was with me at a high level Mr. Fireman said. And I knew him as a good person.  Within months of Mr. Margoliss promotion Mr. Perdue was in discussions with a headhunter seeking an executive with the know-how and experience to turn around Pillowtex a troubled sheet and towel manufacturer with well-known brands in its portfolio including Cannon Fieldcrest and Royal Velvet.  Leaving behind what he would later describe as $5 million worth of in-the-money unvested Reebok stock options Mr. Perdue agreed in spring 2002 to take the job as chief executive of Pillowtex.  The company was just emerging from bankruptcy and thousands of workers at its home base in Kannapolis N.C. viewed Mr. Perdue as a potential savior according to Scott Shimizu a former executive vice president. Looking back though Mr. Shimizu said he believed Mr. Perdues inaction led to the companys demise.  The company needed to sell off assets quickly and outsource production to survive  with the possibility of retaining part of its United States work force  but Mr. Shimizu says Mr. Perdue took few steps to do either.  He didnt really help us said Mr. Shimizu. We were waiting for him to bring the Ten Commandments to us. They never came.  Mr. Perdue would later say he had been misled about the depth of the companys financial problems including a badly underfunded pension plan. He became embroiled in a dispute with Pillowtex over its failure to live up to the compensation agreement he had negotiated.  The company imploded and about 7650 people lost their jobs most of them in North Carolina. The Charlotte Observer called it the largest mass layoff in state history. The hard feelings toward Mr. Perdue were rife in Kannapolis and in 2014 his Democratic Senate opponent Michelle Nunn would release an ad set there highlighting the bitterness.  Mr. Perdue who had been at Pillowtex less than a year soon found a new opportunity that would also touch large numbers of working-class people: at Dollar General. The company boasts that 25 percent of its products retail for less than $1.  As chief executive Mr. Perdue oversaw the opening of a Hong Kong office in 2004 increasing the global sourcing that helps to provide the low everyday price our customers count on according to a company announcement. Among the global sources were manufacturers in China records show.  Low wages were another way the company controlled costs. Store managers sued the company complaining that they were not paid overtime even though they took on nonmanagerial duties unloading trucks and stocking shelves after hours. Some of their claims as well as legal complaints from female workers who said they were inequitably compensated resulted in payouts.  Dollar General flourished under Mr. Perdues leadership adding more than 2000 stores and expanding the use of coolers to stock more grocery items. Former colleagues who visited Mr. Perdue at the companys Tennessee headquarters said it was apparent he was preparing Dollar General for acquisition. In 2007 Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company announced it would purchase Dollar General for about $7 billion. It was later reported that Mr. Perdue walked away with a $42 million payout.  The Perdue family had lived in Nashvilles tony Belle Meade section but it was time to head back to Georgia where Mr. Perdue would ultimately settle on Sea Island a wealthy sanctuary on the southern coast.  The Outsider In 2010 as Sonny Perdue was finishing his second term as governor he named his cousin David to the board of the Georgia Ports Authority.  About a year later records show the cousins formed a company called Perdue Partners which in December 2012 acquired Benton Express an Atlanta-based trucking company that had operated as a regional family business for nearly 80 years. They renamed it Benton Global and pledged to reinvigorate the business by drawing on overseas connections and especially David Perdues ties to Asia according to press reports and interviews with former employees.  The Perdues installed two loyalists of the former governor in top management positions and oversaw the purchase of new tractor-trailers. But the promised new international business never materialized and the company already suffering from flagging revenues struggled to pay its bills. It closed abruptly in 2015 leaving more than 500 truck drivers clerks and terminal workers unemployed.  As a member of the ports authority board Mr. Perdue voted repeatedly on infrastructure improvements that might have benefited his trucking business The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. A spokesman for Mr. Perdue said at the time that none of the votes posed a conflict of interest or aided Mr. Perdue financially.  In 2013 Georgias senior senator Saxby Chambliss announced that he would not stand for re-election the next year. In David Perdues telling he drove to see his cousin and tried to convince him to run. Well he told me he didnt feel led to do so but then he said I should consider running Mr. Perdue later recalled in an interview.  When Mr. Perdue decided to run he recruited top aides from his cousins campaign staff. Davids team was Sonnys team said Jack Kingston a longtime Republican congressman who also sought the vacant seat. Sonny Perdue he said was very instrumental in his cousins campaign.  For all that David Perdue branded himself the outsider the man with the real-world business savvy needed to effect change. The Republican primary was crowded with well-known and seasoned politicians and Mr. Perdue attacked them for their seasoning portraying them in ads as ineffectual mewling babies.  ""We were hoping that we could find an Achilles heel  hes lazy hes going to say something stupid Mr. Kingston said of the campaign. We found him to be pretty disciplined and hard-working. I have to give him good marks.  After defeating Mr. Kingston in a primary runoff Mr. Perdue went on to face Ms. Nunn an executive at a nonprofit whose father Sam Nunn was a former Democratic senator from Georgia. Though both candidates benefited from famous family names Ms. Nunn thought she might gain the upper hand by focusing on the negative effects of Mr. Perdues embrace of globalism.  A month before the election a transcript surfaced of a nine-year-old deposition in which Mr. Perdue said he had spent most of my career outsourcing. Questioned by reporters Mr. Perdue replied that he was proud of that record. This is a part of American business part of any business he said adding People do that all day.  Ms. Nunn pressed the point in her ads and on the debate stage. But she was the underdog and 2014 proved to be a bad year for Democrats burdened by a lack of enthusiasm for President Barack Obama and his signature legislation the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Perdue blasted Mr. Obamas handling of the Ebola virus crisis and vowed to repeal Obamacare. He practically waltzed to victory.  The outsider arrived on Capitol Hill pushing a term-limit plan and railing against career politicians to the annoyance of his fellow Georgia Republican Senator Johnny Isakson according to two people familiar with the views of Mr. Isakson who had spent many years in politics and was gearing up for a third Senate run.  The record Mr. Perdue built was reliably conservative. He submitted a far-fetched  and critics said regressive  proposal to replace income taxes with sales taxes on goods and services. He proposed limits on the ability of immigrants to sponsor family members instead giving priority to college-educated young people with high-paying jobs.  In the beginning he also spoke and voted as one would expect a free trader to do. In 2015 he voted to give Mr. Obama enhanced powers to negotiate big trade agreements including the Trans-Pacific Partnership the most substantial trade accord since the North American Free Trade Agreement of the 1990s.  But Mr. Perdue was also early to see the potential in Mr. Trump who offered a kind of mirror reflection of Mr. Perdues own political persona as chief executive change agent. The two men reportedly met at Trump Tower during Mr. Perdues 2014 run. And after Mr. Trumps inauguration the senator could be unrestrained in his praise at one point comparing the new president to Winston Churchill. This guy I think is a historic person of destiny at a time and place in America when weve got to make a right-hand turn here Mr. Perdue said.  Mr. Perdue and his fellow Republicans quickly had to grapple with the presidents determination to break the partys mold on global trade. Three days into his tenure Mr. Trump tore up the Trans-Pacific Partnership calling it a rape of our country.  Although Mr. Perdues campaign has said that he consistently supported the presidents America-first trade policies the senator spoke out in 2017 against a Trump-backed plan to impose a border adjustment tax that would have raised taxes on companies that import goods into the United States. A year later he criticized the presidents plan to impose steep tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum calling for a more targeted strategy.  But by late 2019 as Mr. Perdues re-election bid on a ticket with Mr. Trump loomed he seemed more amenable to the presidents approach.  The tariffs are creating the opportunity for people to come to the table he said according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. For the first time in five decades we are standing up to the Chinese and other trading partners around the world and all we want is equal access and a level playing field.  The crosscurrents on trade could be tricky and suddenly Mr. Perdues globalist background made him susceptible to attacks from fellow conservatives. In September 2019 Lou Dobbs the powerful pro-Trump TV personality reported that Mr. Perdue and another senator were visiting Beijing where Mr. Dobbs warned they may well be undercutting U.S. and China trade negotiations and progress made by the president. Mr. Dobbs noted Mr. Perdues outsourcing record.  A day later Mr. Dobbs issued a correction noting that Mr. Trump had approved the trip.  The China Problem In 2016 Mr. Perdue had preached Republican unity as the divisive Mr. Trump began gaining ground in the G.O.P. primary. But the senator helped spark a civil war among Georgia Republicans in 2020 when he and his Georgia runoff-mate Senator Kelly Loeffler demanded the resignation of the states top elections official a Republican calling the election he oversaw an embarrassment.  More recently the senators supported a failed Texas lawsuit that would have blocked the election result in Georgia where President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. beat Mr. Trump by about 12000 votes and in three other states Mr. Trump lost.  The battle over Mr. Perdues Senate seat has been no less fierce. Mr. Ossoffs crook attack in a televised debate in October was based on disclosures that Mr. Perdue the Senates most prolific stock trader made a number of well-timed trades including in companies that could be affected by his committees votes. An investigation of some of Mr. Perdues stock dealings by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission ended without prosecution and Mr. Perdue has used those facts to argue that he has done nothing wrong.  Mr. Ossoff has revived criticism of Mr. Perdues outsourcing record. And the senator has also had to fend off charges of bigotry for both his mockery of Ms. Harriss name and an online campaign ad that showed a photo of Mr. Ossoff who is Jewish with a lengthened nose. Mr. Perdues campaign has called the image in the ad an accident caused by a filter applied by an outside vendor handling the graphic design.  For his part Mr. Perdues closing attack is in keeping with Republicans emerging argument that Democrats like Mr. Ossoff are too weak and in some cases too compromised to stand up to the threat of Chinese global dominance.  Mr. Ossoff Mr. Perdue contends is a radical left-winger with a grave China problem. He cites as proof a $1000 agreement that allowed a large media company in Hong Kong PCCW to rebroadcast a documentary Mr. Ossoffs company produced about the Islamic State.  Previous reports have characterized one of PCCWs investors China Unicom as a state-owned Chinese company a point Mr. Perdue has used in an effort to tie Mr. Ossoff to the Chinese Communist Party.  For two years he worked with the C.C.P. the senator said in a Fox News interview.  Mr. Perdue has said little about his own China ties.  In 1991 the year before he headed to Hong Kong to build Sara Lees Asian outsourcing operation from the ground up the company proudly announced a new foothold in Asia  a deal in Fuzhou China.  The joint venture Fujian Sara Lee Consumer Products manufactured toothpaste shampoo and other personal care products. It was partially owned by the Chinese government according to a report in The Chicago Tribune announcing the venture.  As the Fujian arrangement continued Mr. Perdue busied himself with building Sara Lees first centralized sourcing operation in Asia including in mainland China he said in a deposition in 2005. That involved lining up suppliers and overseeing quality control and human rights practices for the company which manufactured Hanes clothing among other things.  No American firm could have established such an operation in China at that time without dealing extensively with the government or the Communist Party industry experts said.  You dont just wander into China without central government and local party officials wanting to know what youre doing said Michael Posner a professor at New York Universitys Stern School of Business and a top human rights official during the Obama administration. Its a very controlled environment. And anybody there who is dealing with factories would have had to deal with that. (While some of its products remain on the market Sara Lee has since disbanded.)  This week The Times asked Mr. Perdues campaign if he had any other business involving the Chinese government.  The campaign declined to answer.  Kate Kelly and Jannat Batra contributed reporting. Susan Beachy Kitty Bennett and Sheelagh McNeill contributed research.  More on the Georgia Senate Races Democrats Georgia Hopes Rest on Jon Ossoff 33.

"U.S. AND RUSSIA  Rising tension between the U.S and Russia should be a cause for concern among all Americans. Let me qualify the following by stating that I am not an expert on U.S. Russian relations; but from a layperson's perspective this is what I see.  Russia has been pushed around by the West since its dissolution in December of 1991. At that time it's state dominated command economy was collapsing and there began a movement towards a free market capitalist system first gradually during the late 1980's under the Soviet leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev then very rapidly under Russia's first democratically elected President Boris Yeltsin.  During the economic collapse of the early 1990's western nation's offered aid to Russia largely through the G7--a group of advanced industrialized nations--and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) contingent on the dismantling of the Russian state dominated economic system. The transformation from the old to the new system within Russia was highly controversial with President Boris Yeltsin pushing for reform while Russia's parliamentary body consisting largely of communist and ultranationalist resisted the rapid transformation. This deeply divided the Nation.  It would be hard to overestimate the hardship this transformation imposed on the Russian people. Widespread homelessness child and adult prostitution increased rates of alcoholism decreased life expectancy all accompanied the transformation to the western style economic model. From 1991-1998 during the western aided transformation Russia's GDP fell nearly 40%. During the 1996 presidential election the G7 and the IMF pumped billions of dollars into the Russian economy in order to salvage a Yeltsin victory from a stiff challenge by a communist opponent.  The transformation left deep scars on the Russian people and depending on one's view of the transformation generated resentment against the West. Many among the older generation the intelligentsia and workers longed for a return to Soviet times. Conspiracy theories abound which suggest the West deliberately undermined the Russian state. One argument states that current President Putin's hybrid authoritarian democratic political model where the U.S. was headed under Trump was an effort to establish order out of the chaos of the 1990's. The U.S. condemns Putin's trend towards authoritarianism but in typical U.S. fashion no such condemnation existed when U.S. President Clinton supported the free market oriented Yeltsin's unconstitutional dissolution of the Russian parliament which had resisted the transformation to the capitalist model. It is of course possible that Russia would have suffered equal economic hardship had Russia persisted on its state dominated path but this matters little as people were suffering and the suffering was due to the then current transformation process.  During West-East negotiations over the reunification of Germany during 1990 Russian concerns about NATO expansion eastward towards the Russian border were allayed when U.S. Secretary of State James Baker assured the Russians that NATO would not expand ""one inch eastward"" towards the Russian border. By the end of the 1990's decade NATO expanded: eastward to include three former Soviet Republics; since then it has expanded eastward to include eleven more states most former Soviet Republics three of which: Estonia Latvia and Lithuania lie directly on a Russian border. NATO has a close working relationship with both Georgia and Ukraine both former Soviet Republics which also lie on the Russian border and both of which are working towards NATO membership. Russians find NATO expansion to its borders as threatening and in breach of Western promises to not expand ""one inch eastward"" towards the Russian border.  Russia's 2014 forceful annexation of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula transferred to Ukraine by Russia during 1954 under former Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev can be seen as an effort to protect both the Russian border as well as the Russian Black Sea fleet partially housed on the Crimean peninsula. Further both Ukraine and Georgia have experienced western friendly coups with U.S. support: the degree to which is subject to debate.  Most recently in response to continued tensions between Ukraine and Russia the U.S. has threatened to float two naval warships into the Black Sea which would be the equivalent of Russian warships sailing into the Gulf of Mexico. How do you think that might work out?  The former great power undoubtedly feels threatened and humiliated by the above turn of events. Russia views itself as a world power which has been undermined by the neoliberal economic order. There is no effort here to suggest Russia is more pure than its western counterparts. Hierarchy is hierarchy and it knows no other way than domination and submission. If the tables were turned maybe the Russians would act in the same manner. This assuredly is the view of the hierarchical actors who play this nonsensical game. Just as assuredly however there are people in Russia as in the U.S. who desire peace. It is hard for the peacemakers to rise to power when there is so much turmoil. To even speak of peace is often viewed as naive. If in the U.S a significant peace movement were to evolve this would allow room for the Russians to do the same. If not we are doomed to "" solutions"" by war. There seems to be no shortage of those who belong to the war movement. It is time for the insanity to end.",political,Facebook
To the people who are on strike  We at Rockin N Rollin fully support your right to protest. We respect that you are willing to fight for what you believe. Choosing to go on strike is not an easy decision to be made especially by those with families to support. We see you taking a bold stance to fight for your right as an American worker and we want nothing but the best for everyone involved. We hope a positive resolution happens soon for everyone.  We are a small local business ran by 3 individual drivers. We work hard every day to provide Omaha with the best we can. We were contracted by a national transportation company to provide simple shuttle service. We were not informed of the situation at hand nor did we expect to be involved in any protest. We apologize for not being better educated on this matter before accepting this contract. We are deeply sympathetic of how important this situation is to you. Our contract ends Sunday and we have full heartedly decided not to renew it. We will no longer be providing our buses for transportation.  We understand tensions are high and there is a lot of anger towards corporate greed but we have had death threats made against us our drivers have been cursed at and berated to the point of tears we have had threats to destroy our buses and business and we have been bombarded by negative reviews.  We are not the enemy. We are just trying to do our job and finish the contract. We understand that we are just one of the many companies caught within the crossfires of protests across the United States battling corporate injustice. These remarks towards us do not progress the movement. They only hurt us and our reputation as a small business that we 3 individuals with families of our own strive and struggle for every day.  If you have posted any negative reviews or comments we ask politely that you remove them. We are a small local company trying our best in these very difficult times. A small business that supports the local economy and helps balance large corporations. We are sorry for this whole situation and by turning down the renewal contract we hope that shows. After our contract ends Sunday we will no longer be providing any buses. We thank you for your understanding and if you'd like to talk to us please reach out at any time.,political,Facebook

MPS Families please READ and SHARE!  Being President of the Midland Public Schools Board of Education is no easy task. I wear a lot of different hats spend a lot of time in meetings and give my heart and soul toward the betterment of the district. I often miss little things like picking kids up from school practices and family dinners.  It is not all bad though. There are plenty of perks. Amongst my favorites are being able to hand out diplomas at graduation address the public on behalf of the board run the Board of Education meetings and to be a cheerleader for the district a hat I proudly and unabashedly wear.  In fact to that end I write today. As we get ready to close the book on our first month back in school (in whatever form that looks like) I want to take a few minutes of your time to lift our district and to talk about the good things we have accomplished together. To proudly display my cheerleader hat and talk about the success of Midland Public Schools during my eight years on the board.  Back in 2012 when I was first elected to the Board of Education MPS was facing several challenges and struggling as a district. I remember some of the big issues at the time were declining enrollment labor relation issues deficit spending and declining revenue. Although the facilities were in decent condition there was a complete lack of technology and building security was marginal at best. We also hired a new superintendent shortly after I was elected.  The hard work began immediately. Since 2012 the Board of Education has worked tirelessly and collaboratively with administration staff students families and community and corporate stakeholders to reimagine and reinvent what public education looks like in Midland. Through hard work dedication blood sweat and tears Midland Public Schools transformed into a model district now ranking amongst the absolute best in the country. An achievement we should all take great pride in and deserve credit for.  One of the most important (and long overdue) steps MPS recently took through board action was the creation and implementation of a DEI (Diversity Equity and Inclusion) initiative. I and my fellow board members worked hand in hand with students community members and administrators to create the MPS vision statement Lead with respect trust and courage. Ensure an equitable collaborative and inclusive culture. Enable all to achieve success. A statement I believe in wholeheartedly.  This vision statement was adopted by the board in July of 2020 and I have got to say I love it and so does our MPS community. Shortly thereafter in August the board took another giant step forward and adopted the Diversity Equity and Inclusion Proclamation: Resolution to Change the System Eliminate Racism and Create More Equitable and Inclusive Schools for All. This was a bold and necessary step designed to bring MPS to the forefront of racial equality and equitable inclusion and as I said before it was long overdue.  I passionately believe this is one of the most powerful and sweeping actions taken by the board during my eight-year tenure. The ripple effect will be wide and enduring. It will be hugely beneficial to both the district and community as we move forward and continue to refine how public education is delivered.  Continuing with the DEI initiative I and my fellow board members committed to attend ongoing DEI workshops. We need to get better and we will. The board committed to investing in a DEI leader who will continue leading this district once Dr. Amy Beasley returns to her post at Dow. The district will perform equity audits invest heavily in teacher and paraprofessional development and perform an administrator book study. We as a board and as a district have decided to stop talking the talk and to boldly start walking the walk. It is no longer ok to be ignorant.  Earlier I mentioned a lack of building security that existed when I was elected to the board. I am proud to say the security protocols have evolved and are now better and stronger than ever. In 2019 the board adopted an updated emergency operation plan that brought sweeping changes throughout the district.  The RAPTOR Emergency Management System was subsequently adopted which includes an emergency response plan and visitor check-in procedures. HALO Vape Sensors were installed in all secondary buildings. ALICE safety protocols were implemented along with the installation of door boot lockdown plates and shatterproof window film on all the buildings.  School Resource Officers were assigned to all four middle schools (thanks to the enhancement millage that was passed in 2018). Other measures include mental health and wellness initiatives secure entrances at all buildings video surveillance card reader access new PA/intercom systems installed district wide. All of this will allow for immediate emergency action and communication should the need arise. The security upgrades our district has undergone are simply amazing and place us amongst the most secure districts in the state perhaps the nation.  Other district initiatives that have been approved by the Board of Education include outstanding programs like: - Project Lead the Way - IB Diploma Programme (Dow and Midland High Schools) - IB Primary Years Programme (All MPS Elementary Schools) - PATHS / PASS - The creation of the pre-primary center at Carpenter School. (4-year old preschool and developmental kindergarten) - NWEA Assessment and Read by Grade 3  MPS and the Board of Education understand fully the importance of closing the achievement gap. To combat the gap MPS created the Pre-Primary Center and hired literacy coaches. Mental wellness partnerships have been forged and social emotional learning has been created and implemented. This includes extensive training for staff providing additional support staff and a partnership with SVSU.  Financially speaking I am immensely proud to report that MPS is standing on solid ground. Over the past eight years our audits have been clean. Perfect. MPS receives constant praise for its financial strength. Our board has been faced with cost-cutting initiatives some born out of necessity but many created by the administration and teachers alike. Adopting these initiatives was not easy but it was the right thing to do for the financial health of the district. Those decisions are paying off in spades.  MPS stands firmly amongst the most financially healthy districts in the state. Make no mistake there is a financial storm looming on the horizon and MPS will face many fiscal challenges soon but we are ready to meet those challenges head on.  To further clarify MPS has gone from a 6% fund balance in 2014 to a 30% fund balance just before 2020. This is almost unheard of in districts across the state and country. The strength of our financial position will allow for weathering of the ups and downs of the economy. It will allow MPS to invest in its employees. In fact all employees recently received salary increases and contracts remain open to additional increases. MPS can invest in capital improvements professional development opportunities and increased programming.  The financial strength of MPS also allows for continued building of partnerships critical to the development of our students and the stability of skilled trades within our community. MPS now leads county wide CTE and is also a proud partner of the Michigan Construction Academy. MPS has developed strong deep rooted partnerships with the MCEA and other community partners like United Way Midland Community Foundation local family foundations (Dow Family Gerstacker and Strosacker) and Dow Chemical Company. These partnerships help MPS remain a leader in raising funds grant proposals STEM IB PYP DEI and STEM to name a few.  It all boils down to this Midland Public Schools is succeeding on so many levels and we need to shout it from the mountaintops! Year after year IB and AP students succeed. MPS has award winning programs in art music journalism CTE and yes athletics. We dominate in athletics. Not to mention MPS has a WORLD CLASS robotics programs at the elementary middle school and high school levels.  The Project Lead the Way program has had tremendous success and has married nicely to the STEM strategic plan. To brag a little more according to 2020 Niche Rankings MPS is among the top 5% best school districts in America. Top 6% best teachers in America. Top 4% best school district in Michigan and top 5% best teachers in Michigan as well as one of the best places to teach in Michigan. Additionally 2020 U.S. News and World Reports ranks Dow High in the top 3.4% of high schools in Michigan while Midland High comes in at the top 6.9% of high schools in Michigan. Our Teachers paraprofessionals and administrators are award winning and recognized throughout the state.  I often get asked why on earth would you want to be on the school board? My response is simple. I love this place. I love Midland Public Schools and everything it stands for. I love serving this community. The four biggest reasons however are my four children. They are more engaged and excited to learn than ever before. I could not be happier that they are part of such a talented diverse cutting edge district.  Do we have work to do? Yes. We have a long road ahead. But just for a moment I wanted to tell you about how far we have come and what we have achieved. That is something to be proud of and something I as a member of this Board for eight years am happy to hang my hat on.  I want to express my SINCERE gratitude to our teachers paraprofessionals administrators community partners and stakeholders. Without each of you MPS would undoubtedly be a quite different place. I have been blessed with the opportunity to serve our beloved district for eight years. Thank you for that. To my fellow board members Jon Phil Pam Lynn Mary and Brad thank you for your service. My family and I appreciate all of you and the sacrifices you each make for MPS.  My commitment to all of you is this: I will continue to lead with respect trust and courage. I will continue to work to be a steward of public trust and will do my absolute best to ensure MPS fully develops and continues to foster a learning environment that is collaborative inclusive diverse and equitable. True to our vision statement I will work tirelessly to ensure MPS remains a district where all can achieve success.

Restoring Trust in Government Will Save Lives  I am among those in Oregon and across the country who support medical freedom because I believe individuals have the right to decide what medical proceduresincluding vaccinationsare right for themselves and their families. Many of us who support medical freedom have been dismissed bullied and marginalized. Our leaders have pursued a heavy-handed approach ignoring concerns and fueling a mistrust of our government.  Our leaders need to be reminded that trust is a two-way exchange that can be built only through listening understanding transparency and bringing everyone to the table for frequentand respectfulexchanges of ideas.  The first two decades of the 21st century have given us many reasons to mistrust all institutions. The war in Iraq the recession of 2008 and the political turmoil since the 2016 election have created distrust of government large corporations mainstream media and especially politicians. Political polarization is at an all-time high and how sad that there are now those who are using COVID to score political points and further fuel the flames of mistrust of government.  We are going on year two of the COVID-19 pandemic and it will likely continue for longer than any of us had hoped. Rather than letting this further divide us it is time to come together and focus on the goal of achieving herd immunity. We must find a way to meet this goal while preventing unnecessary deaths protecting freedom of choice and medical freedoms maintaining a healthy economy and preventing our hospital systems from becoming overwhelmed.  Here is my plan to restore trust in government as we collectively deal with this pandemic:   I will support informed choice and deliver information to Oregonians in the most unbiased way possible. I will make sure we are communicating the most up to date and accurate data on all aspects of COVID.   I will make sure that vaccine related injuries reported within the state are thoroughly investigated and that all relevant information is made public.   I will not support statewide vaccine mandates without exemptions or mandate vaccine passports for COVID-19 or any other vaccine. I will encourage the Oregon Health Authority to work directly with local communities to develop policies that are right for that community.   The state will act as a partner not a dictator of policy. Local communities will have the final say when it comes to mask mandates business restrictions and school closures. I   Of course I will make sure that Oregon hospital systems and providers have the clinical resources and support needed to fight this pandemic and care for all Oregonians. This includes support for delivering new therapeutic treatments as soon as they become available.  COVID is not going away any time soon. Without a vaccine we could face years of wearing facemasks social distancing business and school closures shortages of goods and services and escalating social unrest. Please consider all these factors when you decide what is best for you and your responsibilities in your communities.  One thing I know for sure government doesnt always know best. Government has an undeniable role to play as we all work together to survive this pandemic. That role begins once government fulfills its obligation to partner with the people and stops simply dictating policy to us.  [By Jessica Gomez],political,Facebook
President Joe Biden and the Democrats are committed to pushing their multi-trillion dollar boondoggle upon the American people. But this plan doesnt just come with an expensive price tag  it is filled with radical ideas that will weaken our economy and reorder America as we know it.  To be clear this package:  Forces $2.1 trillion in tax increases on American families and job creators  Imposes Green New Deal polices and destroys American Energy Independence  Allows over $10 billion in federal funding to go toward abortions  Weaponizes the IRS by allowing for monitoring and tracking of almost every single bank transaction made  Provides amnesty to millions and millions of illegal immigrants  Leaves rural America behind by failing to allocate any funds for critical programs like broadband the commodity safety net crop insurance and disaster assistance  This radical spending package is nothing more than a Trojan Horse for the Democrats to force their extreme socialist agenda on the American people.  And the American people are already seeing and experiencing the negative consequences of their failed policies  rising prices Open Borders labor shortages.  It is time to bring back the smart commonsense Republican policies that created a prosperous America with economic growth record unemployment and border security.  Americas future is at risk and we must do everything we can to flight these Far-Left Socialist policies that will only set our country back.  I will do everything in my power to stand against these radical ideas and fight for conservative values and principles like limited government free enterprise and Peace Through Strength that have made our country great.,political,Facebook
Goal #2 Standards-  State and federal laws or regulations set standards of education. As a board we should review standards and ensure they make our students competitive in the world economy. Schools must follow standards established to protect students.  Standards have been a part of my adult life. I learned standards have a purpose when I joined the military. The standard to have a shaved face ensures Soldiers are safe when they put on their gas masks. Now school is not the same as the military but the federal government and state government set education standards.  The board's purpose is twofold; first schools must follow education standards; however if the standards are not ensuring our students are competitive in the world economy our job is to go to our local Legislators or the SD Department of Education and have them change the standards.  State and federal governments create some standards to protect children.  State law says bullying is not allowed. Board and School Policies says it's not allowed. However as a parent I know it occurs in our schools. How is this standard being upheld?  Federal law grants children with disabilities an individual education plan (IEP). This hits home for me. I had an IEP until 9th Grade. The most vulnerable students should be protected and the schools should follow the plan. I want to look into how much funding is going towards special education and technology to assist children with special needs. Is the school district set up to follow state and federal standards? Is the school district financially set up to ensure students with special needs or disabilities can achieve their potential?  I welcome an open conversation regarding education standards. Please feel free to comment.,political,Facebook
"The Value of On The Job Learning  In a recent Flathead Beacon interview with House District 7 legislative candidates my opponent Frank Garner put forward the idea that ""...this is an important year to not be learning on the job. As one of millions of millennials whose had to struggle to work through an unending economic recession I've discovered the necessary value of doing just that.  I attended college with the plan of learning a valuable skill and earning a spot in a top firm in my industry building a career saving a nest egg and one day buying a house and starting a family. So did most of my University peers. What we came out with was multiple thousands of dollars in loan debt while competing for part-time work against Masters and PhD holders who had already been laid off in the great recession. No one told us all our work and study would put us in the same line for minimum-wage part-time contracting work as the rest of the US workforce.  So we scrambled and we moonlighted our way through this new economy. In my first three years out of school I worked nine separate jobs in seven industries in one year three at a time. I worked with a diverse range of people from every economic and social background in wildly different settings ranging from construction to retail to security to education. I adapted to different work cultures and different management structures different rules and expectations.  We millennials were forced to do this when our representatives failed to address the systemic issues our generation was facing. They continue to fail in that task now for Gen Z. Frank Garner is one of those legislators.  When I hear them deriding on the job learning it feels like a dis to everyone who has had to fight to live in this new gig economy. A dis on everyone struggling through 90hr work weeks with no benefits and no health coverage no sick leave and no PTO no savings and dwindling hope that they will ever be able to live the life that our parents and their parents enjoyed in Montana.  Maybe that's the problem. People in our legislature have no idea what it's really like to live and work in today's economy. And that's why we need some on the job learning.",political,Facebook
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - Last week U.S. Steel announced the cancellation of an important investment in Allegheny County citing permit delays from the County that ultimately gave steel manufacturers in another state an advantage. Out of touch political leaders in Allegheny and state governments are blaming U.S. Steel for the failures of their bureaucracy. If we want a dynamic workforce and a flourishing local economy we need a similarly dynamic and responsive local government. The delays and excuses of Allegheny County Health Department and activists are unacceptable and ultimately cost upwards of 1000 jobs.  We have to get beyond this false choice of environmental protection and economic prosperity. The workforce of Allegheny County is ready to be a leader in responsible sustainable manufacturing practices. But it requires local leadership to answer the phone when workers need help. It is clear Allegheny County Council and Councilwoman Anita Prizio failed to pick up the phone and provide that leadership.  I know how important it is to listen to answer the phone to work with people to find solutions that benefit everyone not just special interest groups on either side of the political aisle. If you want a county council and a councilwoman who provides the leadership necessary to keep Allegheny County moving forward I ask for your support.,political,Facebook

"Here are some of the objectives that would be most important to me as a member of Nixa City Council followed by an introduction so that you can get to know me better!:  - Bringing new businesses and jobs to Nixa to boost our economy and infrastructure and balance taxation while supporting local small businesses and helping them to thrive - Supporting our youth and our school district in every way possible - Supporting our elderly residents in every way possible - Supporting the growth and continued excellence of the Nixa Police Department - Implementing new diversity and inclusion initiatives and striving to support and meet the needs of Nixa's under- represented residents - Improving sidewalk connectivity throughout town particularly near schools - Improving traffic flow and speeding issues in problem areas such as school zones - Streamlining city processes to make them as efficient and accessible as possible to include establishing a virtual platform for city council meetings and making improvements to city utilities processes - Continuing the revitalization of the downtown area - Improving and beautifying public spaces - Supporting the visual and performing arts in Nixa - Increasing recreational opportunities for kids and adults of all ages and abilities - Encouraging greater voter interest and turnout - Encouraging volunteerism in the community - Educating residents about and encouraging them to use our free curbside recycling program - Advocating for a second dog park in north Nixa and at least one splash pad  Hello! My name is Amy Hoogstraet (HOOK-strat) and Im thrilled to announce that I'm running for city council in Nixas first district. This is my official campaign page. You might know me on Facebook as Amy Jane Hoogstraet Safley but for campaign purposes Im using my legal last name. Id like to introduce myself and tell you why I want to serve you on Nixas city council. This is a very long post but I wanted to give you as much information about me as I could in order to help you in deciding if I'm the candidate for you. I hope that you'll take the time to read the whole post!  I grew up in Springfield where I graduated from Drury University. After marrying a soldier I spent 20 years away from the area but it was always ""home"" and I finally returned in 2017. My husband and I chose to make our home in Nixa because we loved the small town feel and were very impressed with the schools and we are so happy with our decision! We feel that Nixa is our home and we have no plans to go anywhere else. We have a 16-year old son and a 6-year-old daughter and a fabulous miniature poodle named Sam.  After holding various interesting jobs I left the workforce to become a stay-home mom which is a move I have never regretted. As my youngest has gotten a bit older and more independent and since moving to Nixa I have finally realized my dream of becoming more involved in volunteering advocacy and helping others however I can. This sounds clich but honestly helping others and finding solutions to problems are my passions. And when I commit to something I'm ALL IN!  I am on the board of directors of GLSEN-Springfield which supports and advocates for LGBTQ youth and I also volunteer with PROMO an organization which fights discriminatory legislation in Jefferson City. A defining moment for me and one in which I learned how much I love being involved in government was when I went with PROMO to the Capitol in Jefferson City to speak with legislators there. I was completely in my element and I was good at it  I was hooked! Additionally I founded and am administrator of the Facebook group Nixa MO Diversity Advocates which seeks to celebrate support welcome and educate about diversity. I believe that in diversity (in ALL of its forms!) lies great strength richness and depth and I am very passionate about being a voice for those who are under-represented and fighting for equal rights for all.  Another experience which crystallized my love of civic/government involvement was when I had the honor of serving on Nixas Strategic Planning Advisory Committee this past summer and fall. The committee was comprised of volunteers from the community and was tasked with culling through public feedback and listening to subject matter experts in order to come up with Nixas next five-year strategic plan. It was a lot of hard work and I loved every minute of it! Working with a varied group of people who had a lot of different opinions and priorities but who all agreed that they wanted what was best for our community was exciting and challenging and I not only made valuable contributions to the process but also grew from it. This experience left me feeling sure that I wanted to continue my involvement with local government and with helping to bring the five-year strategic plan to fruition. Its a wonderful ambitious plan and Im very proud to have contributed to it. Im excited to see what we can accomplish in the next 5 years and the amazing ways in which Nixa can grow and improve! My work on the committee along with attending city council meetings has shown me how much grey area there can be in issues involving a city and its residents and I really enjoy the challenge of working within that grey area to find solutions. With my history of volunteerism advocacy collaboration and leadership along with my involvement in the strategic plan joining our city council feels like the next logical step for me and Im incredibly excited at the thought of serving my community in this way!  Why should you vote for me? I believe that my experience on the committee and my prior involvement in the strategic plan puts me in a perfect position to pivot right into city council. I have made valuable connections and have a great rapport with several of our council members and city administrators and feel comfortable working with them. Im continually impressed with our citys administration and would be honored to serve alongside them! As someone who contributed to the five-year plan I am very committed to helping see it through in a way that offers the most benefit to our community. I believe that my education and experiences have equipped me to work confidently yet humbly with others and to look for commonalities and ways to compromise to come up with good solutions to tricky problems. I am a very logical analytical thinker who naturally looks at problems from all angles and perspectives and can think outside the box when needed. I am level-headed and feel comfortable interacting with people even when they disagree with me. Im not given to knee-jerk reactions but rather to thorough consideration of all viewpoints. Im not running with any single agenda  I simply honestly love Nixa and want to help it be the best town it can be. I believe that with a great governing body Nixa can continue to grow be progressive and innovative and stay a leader in the region while still remaining true to its small-town roots. I also believe that the more diverse city council is the stronger it will be and Id love to help further diversify our council by becoming the second woman on the current council. I want to continue to be a voice for those who may not have one and for ALL members of this town I love. I want to see Nixa be as strong as it can be to help build bridges and to unify us while doing my best to make thoughtful decisions with the greater good of the community ever-present in my mind. I truly believe that despite our differences we all have much more in common than we may realize and we all want whats best for our community.  The bottom line is this: I love Nixa I want to help improve my community and build on what is already amazing about it and I believe that my skill-set makes me uniquely qualified to be a valuable member of city council. If elected I pledge to do my absolute best to serve you and I will always be accessible to my constituents. I am an excellent communicator and will be sure to keep the lines of communication open share what is happening and seek feedback from my constituents.  So please consider voting for me! I would greatly appreciate it if you would like and follow my page and share share share! If you dont live in district 1 share my page with friends who do and help me get elected so that I can bring continued progress vision and collaboration to Nixa! Thank you for your time.  Stay tuned  in future posts I will talk about some of the plans and goals for Nixa that are most important to me! And Im always eager and happy to answer any questions you may have.  Please remember that if you support my campaign the single biggest thing you can do to help me is to SHARE MY PAGE (or even a particular post from my page) ONCE A WEEK until the election to like my page and to invite your local friends to like it. The only way that I can win is to reach enough voters in District 1 and convince them to vote for me and for that I need your help! I won't be asking for monetary donations for this campaign - only for a minute of your time each week to help spread the word. :) Thank you!",political,Facebook
"God Our Greatest Need and Help  Our greatest need? A change in character! Not party politics. Not a flourishing economy. Not more church programs! The hardest change to experience is a change of our character.  God is the main ingredient we need if were to change our nature. It takes God to root down deep into our heart-soil.  Think about it That nagging habitual wrong we do so damaging to our souls.  The proud voice inside our head that judges our neighbor his stuff personality clothes family demeanor his cheering for the wrong team and his voting for the wrong politician.  We neglect the poor the prisoner the stranger by withholding the very love they so need.  We justify greed and gluttony but rail against lust and lying.  Only God can hoe these weeds out of our character roots and all.  But will he? Only by invitation.  Imagine a table God sits at. He invites you as he did me  ""I remember pulling up a chair at that table. I was a young man wounded yet full of bravado. Terrified by God but allured by his love. Worried what others thought. Shallow roots Id say. I felt undone with his gaze into my soul. ""Georges... this crippling sin. Do you want to keep it?"" He offered Stay with me. Remain here with me. Watch and pray. I was captured.  Picture yourself sitting at this table with him warts and all. On the table is your souls transformation. God and you.  What does God bring? (Next article will be on what you bring)   Grace aka the power to change your soul.  Complete understanding of how things are with you. I know. It happened to me too. Jesus understands. For our high priest is able to understand our weaknesses. He was tempted in every way that you are but he did not sin. (Hebrews 4:15).  Compassion to look with eyes of love on the truth of who you are: brother sister beloved child of the same Father.  A vision and purpose for which he made you. He did not leave you shepherd less.  Wisdom to see the past the now tomorrow the path to get from here to there.  Forgiveness for your sin.  Delight in you as his beloved. Delight in who youre becoming.  How about it? Are you willing to sit at the table of inward transformation daily? Its a standing invitation.  Heres what he doesnt bring?  Sternness  Impatience  Disappointment because you didnt get it right this time either  Condemnation  God is the patient powerful lover of our souls. He tarries in the chair at the table of your inward nature every day. Whatever the circumstance he never budges from the seat of love. And his love is cleansing and transforming you and me into the likeness of his Son. (Exodus 34:6-9; 2 Corinthians 3:18).",political,Facebook
Senate District 6 Republican primary opponents Anthony Bouhard and Erin Johnson have locked horns in recent days. Bouchards personal attacks against Johnson are tantamount to calling her a liar in a broadly distributed mailer. It said:  Fabricating her actual job experience to trick voters she wont admit to being a contract lobbyist by trade nor that she was fired by Governor Gordon after only a few months on the job because of her incompetence and unethical behavior.  While the ad hominem attack against Johnson is an unfortunate par for the course for Bouchard it does highlight a persistent question that arises after a thorough review of Erin Johnsons public statements: what does she stand for?  To be honest its hard to say. Reading Erin Johnsons public statements it sounds like a Mad Libs game of old school Republican talking points. She wants to cut red tape and get government out of the way. Oddly in the same breath shes advocating diversifying our economy but by doing less to accomplish that goal.  And what to make of her statements that special interests have no place in the Wyoming Legislature when she is in fact a registered Wyoming lobbyist. If thats not the pot calling the kettle black we dont know what is. It definitely shows a willingness to say one thing and do--or be--another.  Point being the Senate District 6 Republican primary is shaping up to be a mudslinging battle between the devil we know and the devil we dont so to speak. So who will voters take their chances with on Tuesday August 18th?,political,Facebook
Hey everyone! The election is now just 3 short weeks away! In these last weeks it is crucial for me to reach as many district 1 voters as possible. Please help out by sharing my campaign page and telling your neighbors and friends in district 1! I am so appreciative of your support and help and if elected I will work as hard as I possibly can on your behalf.  The Christian County Headliner reached out to all of the city council candidates with 5 questions for us to answer. These answers will be published in the newspaper but I'm not sure when. In the meantime I thought I would go ahead and share my answers here:  1. List any relevant qualifications or experiences you would like voters to know about:   I am an active and well-known volunteer leader and advocate in the area (with PROMO GLSEN Free Mom Hugs Nixa MO Diversity Advocates etc.) and already have working relationships with members of the city council and administration the police department the school administration and board and other city leaders. In addition I was a member of the Strategic Planning Advisory Committee which crafted Nixas next 5-year strategic plan. As such Im invested in the plan and eager to be a part of its implementation. With my previous and ongoing civic involvement in addition to my body of experience and skills serving my community on city council is the next logical step and one Im very passionate about taking!   2. What action if any should the Nixa City Council take in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic or in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19?   It seems like Nixa has been doing a good job already of slowing the spread and I believe that with the availability of the vaccine theres light on the horizon. Were not out of the woods quite yet though and we must take care to avoid a resurgence. I believe that wearing masks and physical distancing in addition to getting vaccinated are still the best steps we can take over the next few months. Once the current mask mandate is ended I think that the best thing council can do is to continue to encourage (and serve as an example to) Nixans to wear masks and physically distance and to get vaccinated when eligible. I believe that businesses should remain open and some events should start to take place again with proper precautions in place. And the more of us who are vaccinated the sooner we will all be able to get back to normal.   3. What is your opinion about the level of accessibility that the Nixa City Council has with the general public?   I believe that council has done a great job of being accessible and transparent. Meetings are always posted on the citys website as well as social media and agendas are available to the public ahead of time so that residents can plan ahead as far as attending or speaking at meetings. District 1 council member Jarad Giddens has been very proactive about keeping his followers informed on social media and our citys Director of Communications Drew Douglas goes above and beyond to disseminate information. All that said there is always room for improvement and the citys 5-year plan includes a website overhaul as well as the creation of an interactive app for residents. There are also plans to create a virtual streaming platform for city council meetings for those residents who cant attend in person. Im excited about these changes and think that they will move the city to a whole new level of accessibility!   4. Is there an area of city government that you hope to develop advanced knowledge of in the future? If yes describe.   I cant necessarily point to one single area as Im fascinated with all of them! I want to learn as much as possible and plan to do so while continuing my civic involvement whether or not Im elected to council. Most issues are not black and white but rather have a lot of grey area and I really enjoy the challenge of working within that grey area to find solutions. In attending city council meetings and listening to ordinances being debated and residents speaking about issues I have consistently noted that there are usually valid points on both sides of an issue. Much of the time decisions made by the council will make one group of people happy and one group unhappy - thats a very tough spot to be in! But its this process of weighing pros and cons and figuring out which solution would best serve the greater good which intrigues me and which I think Im very well-suited for. Im a logical thinker who is very detail-oriented analyzes problems from all angles and thinks outside of the box when necessary. In addition I feel that I have a strong ability to empathize with others  to put myself in their shoes. Many issues brought before city council would not affect me personally but that doesnt mean that I wouldnt care about them or take them seriously. I believe strongly that part of being a contributing member of society is recognizing that something shouldnt have to affect you personally for it to matter to you  we should all care about each other. My great passions in life are problem-solving and helping others and as a member of council I would be able to put those passions to work and be a voice for ALL Nixans.   5. What level of involvement should Nixa have in partnering with other local governments such as Ozark and Christian County and with regional economic development groups? Why?   I believe that Nixa should have the highest possible level of involvement in partnering with other local governments and regional economic development groups and from what I have seen so far I think that it strives to do so. Nixa does not exist in a bubble and cannot possibly thrive unless it works in concert with other local governments and agencies. Nixa Ozark and Christian County as a whole share the same issue of being bedroom communities  our residents may live here but a great majority of them work in another municipality. This presents unique challenges to our economies and there is much to be gained by working together to address these challenges share ideas and collaborate in creating solutions. It can be tricky for a bedroom community to find a good balance between supporting local small businesses (We have some really wonderful small businesses here!) and welcoming new businesses which will bring more money and jobs thereby boosting the economy and infrastructure and better balancing the tax burden. Im eager to be a part of finding and maintaining that balance.,political,Facebook

No Texan willing to put in a hard day's work should have to work more than one job to put food on the table and have a safe place to live. The time for a real living wage in Texas is now. I believe in putting an end to the assault on unions and support collective bargaining.  With millions out of work and out of luck due to COVID-19 I'll work with all parties to outlaw the ability for employers to use credit scores in hiring decisions.

Frankly Speaking Why Change? The Town of Ontarios Comprehensive Plan is the guiding document for land use decisions capital investments operational changes and other issues. This planning for the future and the change it will bring is important because it establishes a vision for the communitys goals and objectives over the next 10 to 20 years. A plan for a successful future. We have seen tremendous growth since the 2006 Comprehensive Plan that has changed the landscape of the community. Over the past three years we have added over $90 million in commercial & residential growth. The only thing constant in life is change. If youre not challenging yourself to change and move forward the world will pass you by. Embracing change is an opportunity to improve or try new things. You can either be positive or you can be negative it will happen regardless. Therefore you need to be positive and able to adapt. Technology the economy demographics population growth market trends and consumer attitudes are always changing and they affect our community whether we like it or not. Abraham Lincoln would say the best way to predict the future is to create it yourself. Towns that have a vision for the future will always be more successful than towns that just accept whatever comes along. This past year is a great example of why it is important to embrace change especially in the rapid advancement of technology. During the pandemic all of us experienced the demanding need to embrace change at work and home and adopt digital technology as a way of life. Most things that touch our lives are changing; energy transportation food and the way we work. There are autonomous vehicles sensor-based Smart Traffic Networks drones that carry packages etc. 3-D printing and artificial intelligence replacing routine jobs. Change is an opportunity to improve or try new things. How is Ontario embracing change? Through the installation of LED lights Smart Cities Route 104 transportation study updating the comprehensive plan for the first time in 16 years updating old policies to reflect the times electrical vehicle charging stations with plans to add electric vehicles in the near future our new website gives us the ability to share information faster and sign up for auto notifications. The list goes on. We are looking at using technology to improve customer service giving residents the ability to conduct business with the town from the comfort of their home. My goal is to do this within every department of the town. Using our website you can get information on all building codes current policies and procedures many have been updated over the last three years and this is just the start of the change that I would like to see happen in the future. We are having all documents scanned that will be available through a searchable database. Using more and more technology will lead to increased satisfaction increased efficiencies and improved customer service while reducing the cost of doing business. Currently you must show a survey location of your project and physically drop off the application for a building permit. Imagine being able to pull up your property data a survey and plot where you want a shed or a pool or a deck fill out the form online and press a button to submit it to the Building Department. Thats what I will be advocating for and working towards for the future. The time to prepare for the future is now. We must constantly challenge ourselves to improve services become more efficient and offer services that residents want and need along with continuing to offer the lowest tax rate in the area. A quote by John Beckley that I have lived by is Most people dont plan to fail they fail to plan. Every community has naysayers. Whatever leaders propose to do some people will always say you cant do that it wont work it costs too much. No is a very powerful word but yes is more powerful. Yes we can make this town a better place to live in to work in to visit. A pessimist sees difficulty in every opportunity I see an opportunity in every difficulty.,political,Facebook

"WANT TO KNOW WHY WE ARE VOTING FOR TRUMP! IT'S YOU!.  If you are a liberal who cant stand Trump and cannot possibly fathom why conservatives would ever vote for him let me finally fill you in.  Its not that we love Donald Trump so much. Its that we cant stand you. And we will do whatever it takes  even if that means electing a rude obnoxious unpredictable narcissist (your words-not ours) to the office of President of the United States  because the only thing we find more dangerous to this nation than Donald Trump is you.  How is that possible you might ask? Well you have done everything in your power to destroy our country from tearing down the police to tearing down our history to tearing down our borders. You are systematically destroying our schools and brainwashing our kids into believing socialism is the answer to anything (despite being an unmitigated failure everywhere) while demonizing religion and faith and glorifying abortion violence and thug culture.  From calling us racists every time we expect everyone of any skin color to follow our laws equally to telling us that our tolerance of lifestyles we dont agree with isnt nearly enough....no we must celebrate any lifestyle choice or gender option (forget science) you throw our direction or you think its fine to calls us homophobic or some other degrading slur  and ironically all while lecturing us on hate speech. While you gaslight us about 52 genders polyamory grown men in dresses sharing public locker rooms with little girls and normalize the sexualization of young children you simultaneously ridicule us for having the audacity to wish someone a Merry Christmas or hang a flag on the 4th of July stand for the national anthem or (horror or horrors) don a MAGA hat in public. So much for your tolerance. Do you see why we think you are hypocrites??  Were also not interested in the fact that you think you can unilaterally decide that 250 years of the right-to-bear-arms against a tyrannical or ineffective government should be abolished because you cant get the violence in the cities you manage under control. Free-speech should be tossed out the window history erased and those who disagree with your opinions are fair game for public harassment or doxing. Spoiled children with nose-rings and tats who still live off their parents dime should be allowed to destroy cities and peoples livelihoods without repercussions. That chaos and lawlessness and disrespect for authority should be the norm. This is your agenda. And you wonder why we find you more dangerous than Donald Trump?  Your narrative is a constant drone of oppressor/oppressed race-baiting intended to divide the country in as many ways as you possibly can. You love to sell victim-hood to people of color every chance you get because its such an easy sell compared to actually teaching people to stand on their own two feet and take personal responsibility for their own lives their own communities and their own futures. But you wont do that. You will never do that because then you will lose control over people of color. They might actually start thinking for themselves God forbid!  This is why we will vote for Donald Trump.It is not because he is the most charming character on the block nor because he is the most polite politician to have ever graced the oval office. It is not because he is the most palatable choice not that we love his moral character or because he never lies. It is because we are sick to death of you and all of the destructive crap you are doing to this once beautiful and relatively safe country. Your ineffective and completely dysfunctional liberal leadership(?) has literally destroyed our most beautiful cities our public education system and done its damndest to rip faith out of peoples lives.  However bad Donald Trump may be (and he is far from perfect) every day we look at you and feel that no matter what Donald Trump says or does there is no possible way he could be any worse for our country than you people are.  We are sick to death of your stupid destructive ignorant and intolerant behavior and beliefs  parading as wokeness. We are beyond sick of your hypocrisy and B.S. We are fed up with your disrespectful divisiveness and constant unrelenting harping and whining and complaining (while you live in the most privileged nation in the world) while making literally zero contributions of anything positive to our society. Your entire focus is on ripping things down never ever building anything up. Think about that as there is something fundamentally very wrong in the psychology of people who choose destruction as their primary modus operandi.  If Donald J Trump is reelected rather than blame us look in the mirror and blame yourselves. Because you are the ones that are responsible for the rise of Donald Trump. You are the ones who have created this monster that you so despise by your very actions your refusal to respect your fellow Americans and the things that are important to us.  You have made fun of the fly-over states the people who cling to their guns and religion the middle class factory workers and coal miners and underprivileged rural populations that you dismissively call yahoos and deplorables. You have mocked our faith and our religion. You have mocked our values and our patriotism. You have trampled our flag and insulted our veterans and treated our first responders with contempt and hatred.  You have made environmentalism your religion while trashing every city you have taken responsibility for. You scream from the rooftops about global warming and a green new deal while allowing tens of thousands of homeless people to cover your streets in literal garbage needles and plastic waste without doing a single thing to help them solve the environmental crisis that your failed social policies are creating. But were supposed to put YOU in charge of the environment while gutting our entire economy to institute this plan when you cant even clean up a single city?? You complain  endlessly  yet have failed to solve a single social problem anywhere. In fact all you have done is create more of them.  Weve had enough. We are tired of quietly sitting by and being the silent majority. So dont be surprised when the day comes when we finally respond. And trust me its coming sooner than you might think. And also trust me when I say it wont be pretty. Get ready.  If Donald Trump is reelected it will be because you and your comrades have chosen to trash the police harass law-abiding citizens and go on rampages destroying public property that we have all paid for and you have zero respect for.  If Donald Trump is reelected it will be because we are sick of your complete and utter nonsense and destruction. How does it feel to know that half of this country finds you FAR more despicable than Donald J. Trump the man you consider to be the anti-Christ? Let that sink in. We consider you to be more despicable more dangerous more stupid and more narcissistic than Donald Trump. Maybe allow yourself a few seconds of self-reflection to let that sink in. This election isnt about Donald Trump vs. Joe Biden. This is about Donald Trump vs. YOU.  So if on the morning of November 4 (or more likely December 29 by the time the Supreme Court will weigh in on the mail-in ballot fiasco we are headed towards) if Donald J. Trump is reelected the only people you have to blame is the left-wing media drones and yourselves. You did this. Yep you!""  Time to walk away! BY- ANONYMOUS",political,Facebook
COVID-19 has shown that relatively stable individuals and communities are often ill equipped to independently deal with emergencies. As such I will focus on the structures that empower and strengthen individuals businesses and local communities and their ability to adapt and respond. A thriving economy is built on small businesses so we need to remove barriers to entrepreneurship and market entry as well as support the diversification of local economies. We should rethink zoning in ways that support economic diversification environmental health and access to safe affordable housing. Finally a focus on the budget that funds infrastructure and essential services without raising taxes in these difficult economic times.  #returnpowertothepeople,political,Facebook
If you can't print money you can't buy votes.  Few members of Congress or the current administration are educating the public on the dangers of trillions of dollars of money printing. Revenues through taxation only amount to approximately $3.5 Trillion dollars per year.  In 2020 the federal government spent $6.5 Trillion dollars. In 2021 the amount of spending compared to tax revenue will be as divergent if not more so.  Few people realize that inflation is not caused by rising consumer prices. It is the result of the money supply or in other words the printing of money.  Republicans have traditionally been more conservative in regards to budgets spending and taxes but both parties seem to have now surrendered to the printing of money to sustain and attempt to grow the economy.  History shows that great civilizations when they have devolved to the devaluation of their currency through the printing of money have all failed their greatness only a memory.  One of the main reasons for this devaluation of money (loss of buying power and standard of living) is the desire of politicians to get elected and maintain their power via promises of giving the public gifts or in other words 'buying votes' by promising money for projects services stimulus etc. etc.  While such projects for the public good are often necessary rarely if at all are the consequences of these 'gifts' ever discussed.  We are at a point in American and world history where the house of monetary cards has become so heavy in debt from the printing of money (unearned income) that there is a real danger of economic downturn if not collapse.  Math doesn't lie. The U.S. and world debt have reached such high levels as to no longer be sustainable without super high inflation and further supply lines blockages.  The United States can no longer afford this out of control borrowing and spending for it is not future generations that will pay the price it is the current ones.,political,Facebook

I just voted NO on the Continuing Resolution.  One of the most important responsibilities of the House of Representatives is to adequately fund our federal government. Democrats have put that responsibility on the backburner focused all their energy on Bernie Sanders $3.5 trillion spending spree and once again found themselves forced to ram through a last-minute Continuing Resolution to prevent a government shutdown. To make matters even worse Democrats are using this legislation to raise the debt ceiling to pay for their out-of-control federal spending at a time when the United States is nearly $29 trillion in debt.  Our nation is already facing record-high inflation a stagnant economy a humanitarian crisis at our southern border and national security threats from our adversaries following the catastrophic withdrawal from Afghanistan.

Tonight Council passed the following resolution 5-2. Voting aye were myself Dixon Perry Waggoner and Alderson. Opposed were Sells and Spriet. I want to thank all of the citizens who took the time to testify in person tonight as well as call or send emails. Your voices made a difference.  RESOLUTION No. 3881  RESOLUTION DECLARING AN ECONOMIC MENTAL HEALTH AND CRIMINAL ACTIVITY CRISIS DUE TO THE CURRENT COVID-RELATED STATE EMERGENCY DECLARATION AND RELATING OSHA MANDATES AND GUIDANCE  WHEREAS the Oregon Governors Executive Order 20-03: Declaration of Emergency due to COVID-19 and all subsequent and related OSHA guidance and present and future executive order extensions of such are arbitrary ineffective and draconian; and  WHEREAS we as a municipality have no legal ability to summarily flout these mandates guidelines and enforcement by OSHA and therefore cannot protect any local business from State-directed targeting repercussions and penalties if such local business personally chooses to; and  WHEREAS we also recognize that neither city county nor state government has the legal right to flout the Oregon State Constitution or the United States Constitution; and  WHEREAS we do believe our citizens are fully capable of making their private individual healthcare and lifestyle decisions themselves; and  WHEREAS we recognize that COVID-19 is indeed a contagious virus and contagious viruses do exist in the world; and  WHEREAS science has shown over the last year that COVID-19 is overwhelmingly survivable and lockdowns do not stop its spread; and  WHEREAS all models and projections used to justify initial state emergency mandates have been proven inaccurate over the past year; and  WHEREAS our local hospital and health care system are not overwhelmed with COVID cases and never have been; and  WHEREAS Baker City is obligated to adopt regulations designed to promote the public safety and general welfare of its citizenry; and  WHEREAS a majority of our local businesses directly attribute state lockdowns and OSHA guidelines as solely responsible for their inability to earn a living or pursue other rights as outlined in our State and U.S. Constitutions and therefore we believe their property is being unconstitutionally seized by government without due compensation under the auspices of inappropriately weaponized State agencies; and  WHEREAS too many businesses in Baker City are on the brink of permanent closure creating a fiscal emergency and a devastated local economy; and  WHEREAS too many businesses in Baker City have already closed their doors permanently as a result of the Governors emergency declaration; and  WHEREAS the Governors lockdown and masking mandates are actively creating division and unrest with the increased potential of physical violence within our community as those of one opinion are encouraged by it to impose their opinions over the free will of those of another in a physical way and we are obligated to address and prevent crime; and  WHEREAS the limited number of beds in our local County Jail is resulting in an ongoing cite and release system that puts criminals straight back on the streets to further victimize our community immediately after arrest; and  WHEREAS the Governors mandates result in pitting local law enforcement against law-abiding citizens rather than criminals which damages our communitys strong relationship with our valued local law enforcement and which is a dynamic no community should tolerate; and  WHEREAS deliberate isolation of the ill in hospitals or the elderly left to die alone of that isolation is the cruelest of abuses and is not to be accepted in any civilized society; and  WHEREAS it is a violation of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution for a government to limit how our churches and citizens choose to practice their religious freedoms which are crucial to mental health; and  WHEREAS social distancing and prolonged isolation are proven to create a number of mental health issues such as anxiety and depression sometimes pushing individuals over the edge toward suicide as a last resort; and  WHEREAS that same social distancing and prolonged isolation combined with unemployment and other stressors are increasing cases of domestic abuse and violence; and  WHEREAS we believe in the kindness compassion and common sense of our citizens and businesses to help protect the most fragile and susceptible in our community;and  WHEREAS fear is a tool of untruth manipulation and control - characteristics all of which do not reflect the values of our citizenry; and finally  WHEREAS we are mindful of the sentiments of our founding fathers such as Patrick Henry who said Give me liberty or give me death; and Samuel Adams who said Our unalterable resolution should be to be free; and Thomas Jefferson who said The spirit of resistance to government is so valuable on certain occasions that I wish it to be always kept alive and What country can preserve its liberties if its rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance?; and finally John Adams But a constitution of government once changed from freedom can never be restored. Liberty once lost is lost forever;  NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that we declare an economic mental health and crime crisis due to the current COVID-related State Emergency Declaration and related OSHA mandates and guidances as a means of loudly and symbolically supporting our citizenry; and  BE IT RESOLVED the City will communicate in writing with the Governors Office to encourage the full opening of our city and county recategorization to low-population status or suggesting other means necessary to give our citizens relief from these mandates; and  BE IT RESOLVED the City will support upcoming legislation dependent upon its straightforward and unharmful wording which provides reparations to business owners who have had their businesses and income taken without compensation; and  BE IT RESOLVED the City will support future statewide ballot initiatives that limit the duration and extent of Governors emergency powers which may create similar lockdown scenarios during future emergencies natural disasters and pandemics; and  BE IT RESOLVED the City will share this resolution with other Oregon cities counties and media outlets in the hope those entities will also speak more loudly; and  BE IT RESOLVED the City recognizes the citizenry of Baker City are free sovereign individuals within a Constitutional Representative Republic not subjects or slaves and will be recognized as such as we firmly stand to represent them.

Good evening all. I am excited to ramp up my campaign for Township Supervisor and working hard for the residents of the township. - I believe in increasing the support of our Police EMS Firefighters and Public Works to ensure the safety and resilience of our community. - I will work to strengthen UPTs economy by balancing the budget holding the line on taxes and controlling spending. - I believe in stopping the rezoning of Park House. And furthermore protecting what is left of our open space. The pace of development has to slow down. - I have a vision for Smart growth by developing and implementing the 10-year comprehensive plan by listening to the whole township. - I will guarantee greater transparency and greater public input around large projects.  I vow to represent the voice of all residents and not the special interests. I can use all the support I can get to help drive this message and lead UPT to be great for years to come.  Stay tuned for coming fundraisers and special events. I am excited for the opportunity to meet with any community in the township to listen and learn more about the interests and needs of the residents. More to come Best regards Tom,political,Facebook
"Volusia County needs a meat processing plant to process locally raised beef pork and poultry. We have just witnessed the vulnerability of our food chain due to Covid 19. For crying out loud.....we have had to ration food because much of our food is processed centrally. (Let's not forget the diligence and determination of our truckers to ""Keep on Trucking"" or the food chain break would have been worse.) Create a whole new local industry which could serve the entire state. The byproducts could create a whole line of goods.

"In 1992 I got picked up for 14 warrants that had been issued for my arrest. Although they were all misdemeanors the judge still sentenced me to 5 months and 11 days in the county jail. So off to jail I went.  So they have this thing in jail called ""good time."" The way it works is that if you have good behavior over a certain period of time the warden will shorten your sentence. I can still remember writing the authorities to request reduced time so I could go free. He only gave me 5 days good time. :-(That was the best my good behavior could get me. Oh well I guess it was better than nothing.  I've come to learn over the years that this same mentality is how most people approach God. They do there best and hope and pray that God will see them and bless them based on their ""good behavior."" Unfortunately in Gods economy it doesn't work that way.  The truth is that we are all spiritual criminals of sorts. We were never designed to live life apart from God and that is our crime. Sadly for those who do want to know God try to find Him and access Him the wrong way. (Religion works sacrifice etc.) Most approach God like those seeking good time only to be disappointed. They don't realize that access to God is not based on good behavior or good intentions. That key won't open the door because our good could never outweigh our bad. The Bible is clear that if we broke one of His laws we've broken them all. So God came up with a plan to get us out of jail. He did this through something we know as substitution.  God being rich in mercy gave His Son Jesus who never sinned to be our substitution. In other words God put the punishment for our sins upon Jesus at the cross. He died the death we deserved. Not a fair deal but definitely good news. Almost to good to be true news. So in Gods economy the key to going free is not ""good behavior"" but ""good news"" Freedom doesn't come through earning something it comes through believing something! Jesus is the good news and if we will believe and trust Him and what He has done on our behalf we can experience Gods freedom and go free.  You have to really be careful here because something within all of us wants to take credit for our own good time and that will kill the deal. You see the truth is that only one is good and His name is Jesus! So if you are in prison today stop looking for Gods response through good behavior and call upon God for the mercy that He provided for you through the cross of His Son Jesus Christ.............  For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever would believe on Him would not perish but have everlasting life. John 3:16  My name is Pat and I approve of this message and even if I don't it's still the truth.",political,Facebook
"Dear Friends and Neighbors  As you may have guessed from all the yard signs I'm running for County Commission. Why? Because like many of you I think our community is heading in the wrong direction. Too many hotels are being built too fast. The out-of-control growth of tourism is having a negative effect on quality of life for residents. If elected I will put the interests of residents first.  Ive served on the county planning commission since 2017 and I played a significant role in Grand County's 2019 decision to hit the ""pause button"" on new tourist lodging. I will not need on-the-job training. I have the knowledge and experience to make things happen and get our community back on the right track.  Tourism is and will continue to be a major part of our economy. But we must manage tourism so that Grand County continues to be a great place to live for us full-time residents. If you prefer the ""anything goes"" approach to tourism which caused the problems we face today then I'm not your guy. If you want an experienced and resourceful commissioner who will prioritize the interests of Grand County residents and work toward smarter management of tourism then please consider voting for me.  For more details read on.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  About me. I've lived in Grand County since 1989  more than half my life. This is my home and I'm committed to making sure it remains a great place to live.  Efficient government. I crunch numbers for a living and I look forward to bringing my mathematical skills to bear on the county budget. It's important that at least a couple of commissioners are familiar with all the details of the budget. I've attended all of the weekly Budget Advisory Board meetings this year. These are the meetings where most of the county's spending decisions are made. If we want a competent and efficient county government then we need commissioners who will pay attention to budget details.  Economic diversity. Covid has taught us that it's not a good idea to put all of our economic eggs in the tourism basket. We don't want to be a one-industry town. But Covid also presents us with opportunities as people with portable jobs seek other places to live. One of many ways we can diversify our economy is to try to attract some of this newly mobile workforce. This will have spin-off effects that will benefit existing businesses in Grand County. To pursue this goal we need to make sure that Grand County remains a pleasant place to live which also benefits all of us who live here.  A smarter approach to tourism. We should aim to increase the dollars tourists spend here while also decreasing the disruption they cause. Any advertising we do should have these goals in mind. We need to make sure that tourism does not negatively affect residential neighborhoods. And we need to make sure that tourism does not drive up the price of commercial land and make it difficult for non-tourism businesses to get established.  Reasonably priced housing for residents. While on the Planning Commission I helped craft the ""High Density Housing Overlay"" program. This creates incentives for developers to build housing that is reserved for Grand County workers and is protected from competition from second homes and overnight rentals. It should create affordable housing for middle-income levels. 300 units have been approved and ground has already been broken for some of the projects.  I want to hear from you. Because of Covid I'm not able to go door-to-door and speak directly with voters. But it's still very important for elected officials to hear voters' concerns. This means a diverse cross-section of our community not just people who speak at public meetings. You can let me know what you think by filling out the short survey at .

"Every politician in North Carolina says ""Everyone deserves broadband."" The problem has been that we haven't seen many plans for actually getting there.  A sound plan for universal broadband starts with repealing a bad law from ten years ago that banned cities and counties from installing their own broadband.  Around the General Assembly its called the municipal ban and heres what happened:  About 15 years ago Wilson County wanted broadband. So it asked private providers to come and install it. They said no because it wouldnt be profitable.  So Wilson installed broadband itself. The idea was to make it available to people just like a local utility service like water or electricity. By 2008 Wilson had installed 600 miles of fiber throughout the county and called it Greenlight Community Broadband.  The private providers saw this as the beginning of a trend they didnt like so they sent their lobbyists to Raleigh and the majority party in the General Assembly passed a law that literally bans your town city or county from investing in high-speed internet on your behalf.  It was called the Level the Playing Field Act. The private providers argued that public entities - like towns and counties - shouldnt be allowed to install broadband because they can operate without a profit margin and that puts the private providers at an unfair disadvantage.  The problem with that argument is that these are often towns and counties that private providers have turned down precisely because they cant make a profit installing broadband.  So what are these counties supposed to do? Private companies wont come and now the county is legally prohibited from making the investment itself.  That means the only way broadband can reach them is if the state subsidizes private efforts - which we do with millions of dollars each year but honestly it hasnt been nearly enough to close the gap.  Over half the state is limited to only one high-speed internet service provider and there are some industry forces that would obviously like to keep it that way. But I believe that if your town wants to install fiber it should be free to do so - and we should make clear by federal statute that going forward they will have that freedom.  Let me tell you what this looks like when youre traveling the state.  We just did town halls in every county. At each stop I would say to the crowd Hey folks give me a thumbs up or a thumbs down on the general internet situation here. Is it basically good or basically bad?  We got mixed results depending on where we were in the state but out east it was just an ocean of thumbs down. Thumbs down across the whole region.  Until we got to Wilson. Then everyone gave two thumbs up.  Why? Because Wilson finished installing its public broadband *before* the ban went into effect. And its made a world of difference for their local economy and their families.  So to get to universal broadband legalizing municipal internet is key but theres more to do beyond that - like partnering with rural electric cooperatives which have deep experience in getting low-cost utility service to rural counties. Those non-profit co-ops were created after the Rural Electrification Act of 1935 and they helped revolutionize rural life in our state by bringing electricity out to farming communities. With respect to broadband their expertise and infrastructure have been under-utilized assets.  Then theres simply the matter of scaling up funding for laying fiber. Theres no getting around the fact that we simply need a lot more fiber in the ground. Theres an existing state program to do that but its woefully underfunded. Hundreds of millions of dollars from North Carolinas share of the American Rescue Plan (i.e. the Covid relief bill passed earlier this year) could be used for that purpose - and theres bipartisan support for a state bill that would do that. Then theres the bipartisan infrastructure bill that just passed the Senate which may contain another $100 million for broadband - which is not a massive amount given the scale of the challenge but is certainly welcome.  In parts of our state where low-earth orbit satellite may be the best option (i.e. Starlink) we need to help close the affordability gap for low-income families. These new satellite options came up in conversation most often in our town halls in the west where the mountains make fiber installation more expensive than any other part of our state. The technology here is moving quickly which makes this the hardest part of this issue to predict and plan but early results have been promising and scaling up this kind of service may become highly cost-efficient in the near-term.  We should also strengthen the Lifeline program which exists to help people afford broadband service. Right now only a quarter of families who are eligible for Lifeline currently participate in the program. We need to implement coordinated enrollment so that families who qualify for certain other government assistance benefits - like Medicaid and SNAP - would be automatically enrolled in Lifeline.  ***  So the bottom-line is that there isnt just one lever to pull here but if we just did the obvious stuff - legalize municipal broadband provide modest subsidies to very low-income families and use relief funds to scale-up our fiber investment - wed see tremendous progress very quickly.  Those are the components of a realistic plan that is practical affordable and would be widely supported across our state.  Thats what Im going to campaign on and if elected thats what Im going to fight for.  - Sen. Jeff Jackson",political,Facebook
The Next Election: On 27 October the City of Chester every Ward will be voting on who will fill the Ward 4 Seat vacancy created by the removal of William King who violated the State Constitution in order to run fraudulently submitting his Statement of Intention for Candidacy in order to fill that seat. You may recall that one of our lawsuits was the force that actually removed his unlawfully sitting on that council seat. Due to a decrease in intimidation and fear of reprisal we have five candidates for that seat and a greater interest in the management of the City of Chester. We have chosen to post them in alphabetical order in order to show a nonbiased review of the candidates. As political candidates people open themselves up to a greater degree of scrutiny we feel it pertinent to mention criminal records civil cases in which candidates were listed as defendants social media posts mottos platforms and things pertinent to performing the honor of representing the people of Chester appropriately. Some things remain personal but criminal activity lawsuits in which they were a defendant public posts and that sort of thing are some of the things we look at in informing the people. We do however strongly suggest candidates have some sort of plan at least a platform and motto so that the people have some basis for knowing what exactly they are voting for. We did not find a great deal of information on Debra Brice other than a past civil suit which appears to have been settled and no criminal record. Her campaign poster motto is Dedication Determination Change. Change starts with your vote. From what we found it appears she may have worked as an insurance clerk.  Kathryn Dickinson is a retired schoolteacher with no criminal record and has not been the defendant in any civil suit we could find no bankruptcies and no negative things have been found by us. Her motto on her campaign signs is Better Together. She is one of the few candidates weve seen who has put forth a formal platform. Here is Kathy Dickinsons Platform: Working together to improve opportunities for the people of Chester is especially important to me. We need to form partnerships with the community organizations that are focused on improving the community of Chester. The City needs to be more cautious about their spending practices keeping in mind Chester is suffering with a poor economy especially now with the pandemic. Additionally I believe FOIA requests should be answered in a timely manner and good efficient records should be kept insuring that. All this being said focus needs to be emphasized on keeping the best department heads we can get so that everything can run smoothly and efficiently.  Harvey Bernard Heath is a former possibly a current coach. We have seen two mottos used vote for change which seems extremely popular and a voice for the children a voice for the people. We debated on mentioning some basic issues with Mr. Heaths spelling grammar and ability to communicate well and then decided just to let you decide. In comments is Mr. Heaths Statement of Intention for Candidacy. You can read it and decide for yourself if spelling writing etc. are of concern to you or not with a representative. One of us met him not long ago although he probably didnt know that person is a CCEG member but he seems like a genuinely nice and sincere man. We just have some concerns about education level in regard to performing as a representative properly due to all there is to learn. We do however commend him and the other candidates for stepping up and asking for the honor of representing the people of the City of Chester. It is probably a bigger concern that the election commission doesnt appear to properly review these letters of intention for candidacy as they should with the misspellings on his letter and numerous issues on the letter of intention for candidacy for William King whose removal from this seat created the vacancy in the first place. They need to do a much better job at the election commission.  Robbie King is our most concerning candidate. You may recall that her brother William King claimed the same address of 121 Cemetery St in order to run in 2015 and again in 2017 while in fact no one lived at that address in 2015 2016 or 2017 until after the election was over at least and we never really confirmed he ever lived there. Per one of our lawsuits we won against William King by default judgement (the facts were not in question and no further evidence was required to make a decision) what matters is that the person be qualified on the day of the election. We have also been told by several people that Robbie King doesnt even live in Chester. Perhaps she plans on moving here or has recently but we are greatly concerned that this may be another King swindle in order to maintain some form of political power in the City of Chester. On Beacon the property was purchased by her brother John King but then lists her as owner which we believe is simply the point of contact. Under that field it lists her address as 228 Black St. Rock Hill SC. Which appears to be a commercial building and those that have told us she does not reside here have said she lives in Lancaster. So we have been unable to confirm her address where she resides but have obvious concerns. Probably more concerning than this potential issue is that she has numerous nuisance and abatement cases she plead guilty to within the county with a number of properties. The obvious question seems to be if you cant keep your own properties maintained at least to a degree that youre not violating the law how can we expect you to help bring the City of Chester to an acceptable standard? We also found no motto or platform presented by Robbie King.  Tony Nelson is the last candidate for Ward 4 simply because of alphabetical order so please dont read anything into that. We have had a bit of trouble in verifying information about Tony Nelson as there seems to be more than one person with that name in Chester one male and one female. It appears shes had numerous legal issues with financials such as evictions a legal history that potentially shows poor financial decision-making. Also on her statement of intention for candidacy form the block that asks for county or city is supposed to be filled in with the City of Chester not simply city. You may consider that a slight ding against her for not understanding that or not but I find it to be another ding against the election commission for not carefully reviewing the letters of candidacy. We found no motto or platform for Tony Nelson either.  We will not post campaign signs or commercials but would strongly encourage any and all of the candidates to message us a platform and motto if they have one for us to share with the voters of Chester. Statements such as Vote for ********* will not be included. Thank you.  We will be posting what we have found for the November elections soon as well. Early voting has begun so please check your voter registration is current and go vote. If you live in the City of Chester you vote on every ward candidate. The candidate must live in the appropriate ward but we all vote on all the council members. Nothing posted should be considered an endorsement of a candidate. We may have our own personal opinions and vote accordingly but CCEG does not endorse candidates per our bylaws. Simply read take in the information provided and decide for yourselves. We may also have opinions that we post when we deem appropriate but that will not include an endorsement. We are not a newspaper or media outlet although all too often opinions are inserted with some of those agencies so when we decide it is appropriate we will often provide an opinion based on our research and experiences. Yours may be different and that is fine. We probably still agree with 90% of what we discuss and conclude with. So if we can push forward that 90% together that is still a tremendous amount of progress. Thank you and please vote.,political,Facebook
"To all : President Trump was a great American patriot and leader. His presidency was everything but dictatorial. His leadership was compassionate and smart and good for the country despite all the fake propaganda and demonization by the democrats and the fake news media. He governed with love of country and an America First ideology and not of party and partisanship and corruption. He placed the interests of the American people first and foremost. He was smart in dealing with foreign powers friends and foes included and brought respect and dignity to America. He brought back jobs that had been lost forever and created the greatest economy in the history of the country with record employment and growth for all including every minority group. He did this despite the greatest slander misinformation collusion and multiple coup attempts against his Presidency and his character and his administration. He did this despite one of the worst pandemics in modern history and constant barrage of attacks by the democrats and their allies in the fake MSM and despite two hoaxes of an impeachment and Russian collusion hoax.He created a vaccine in record time when everyone of his opponents made fun of him and ridiculed him. operation ""warp speed"" has saved tens of thousands of lives  if not millions in this country and the world. He was falsely called a racist antisemite Hitlerian dictatorial and many other derogatory names all as part of the attempt to cheat him out of a second term which he won by a landslide and millions of more votes than the votes of his first term election.History is not subject to the manipulations and machinations of the corrupt few and time will be the ultimate rightful judge of this man and his love for his country and people. The swamp and the deep state won but the majority of The American people know the truth and will not allow it to continue to rule for long. Many have been fooled and misled but the awakening is here and The People will take over their country from the greedy and the corrupt and powerful. God has always watched over America and its people because despite all its flaws and all its shortcomings it is the most democratic country in the history of mankind and a force for good and benevolence. It is no wonder everyone is trying to come here from all over the globe and whether they come legally or unlawfully they never want to leave. God bless America and President Trump you will never be forgotten by your good people NEVER !",political,Facebook
"MODERN MONETARY THEORY AND INFLATION  Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) offers a description of monetary operations which has drawn increased national attention over the past two decades. The proponents of MMT are mercilessly maligned by orthodox economists the press and others; their views are often badly distorted in various press publications.  MMT puts forth the idea that monetary sovereign nations: nations with their own free floating currencies are not budget constrained in their spending practices. Sovereign nations such as the U.S. which create their own currencies cannot possibly be constrained by funding issues as they create their own currency and there is no operational limit on the amount of currency which they can produce. There are practical inflationary constraints on a sovereign monetary authority's production of money but funding constraints are self-imposed and do not reflect the ability of a sovereign monetary nation to spend as appropriate on a nation's needs.  The mechanics for MMT go like this. When the federal government spends money enters into a checking account. This spending action has in effect and in reality based on definitional categories of money actually produced new money. When the federal government collects taxes or borrows it destroys money: it takes money out of the economy. There is no natural law which states that federal expenditures must equal taxation and borrowing. In other words the Federal government need not fund federal deficit spending with debt. This is a policy choice. Households must match that which comes in with that which goes out but governments which create their own currencies are not likewise constrained. The truth of these statements is readily demonstrated through an examination of the U.S. colonial period during which colonial governments spent currencies into existence. The North's use of Greenbacks during the Civil War provides another example of this practice.  Excessive money creation without adequate money destruction i.e. taxation and borrowing will create inflation in the goods services and asset markets. MMTers readily acknowledge this point. Inflation occurs in the goods and services sectors when expenditures exceed productive capacity or in MMT words when the economy bumps up against real resource restraints. This makes perfect sense. This is also where MMT gets badly misrepresented in the press as economists financial analysts and others make the outrageous claim that MMT promotes the view that the federal government can endlessly spend without inflationary consequences. A recent opinion piece in The Hill (March 30 2021) stated: ""For those unaccustomed with MMT in essence it states that the U.S. government can print and spend money limitlessly."" This is not the MMT view and the promoters of such a view generally reveal their lack of serious study of MMT or worse MMT views are cynically misrepresented in an effort to impose discipline on federal government spending.  While on this topic we should not allow the current system to escape criticism on the inflation front. The system's dependence on unemployment underemployment and low wages in order to preserve price stability create other inflationary forces which generally go unrecognized. These unrecognized inflationary forces include police prisons the U.S. military and other unproductive activities which do not directly add to the production of goods and services. Much of the need or perceived need for these services can be directly linked to low income conditions in large segments of the U.S. population. The U.S. military is included here as it offers employment to impoverished workers and it is a necessary appendage to the competitive and inherently expansionary nature of the capitalist system.  The unemployed require state support and it is right to provide this support; but these unemployed labor earnings combined with earnings from labor and capital which result from the nation's roughly $730 billion military budget and additional large earnings from employment in prisons police forces and so forth: all of which adds nothing to the production of goods and services puts upward pressure on the prices of these goods and services. To date countervailing deflationary forces have hidden these inflationary costs. Without consideration of these inflationary forces we immediately go to wage gains as the source of inflationary pressure. As nice as it would be to see a military budget of zero one has to wonder about the deflationary impact of such a budget. Nonetheless a demilitarized world is a worthy goal and it would be better to direct soldiers into productive rather than destructive activities.  Part of MMT's theoretical framework is a full employment federal jobs program which guarantees employment to any willing participant at a respectable minimum wage along with healthcare and childcare services. MMT correctly perceives that one of the major problems with the free market economy is there is a constant pool of unemployed underemployed and low paid labor which damages both the individual and the broader national economy. Under the MMT scheme the wage in the job guarantee program would effectively set the national minimum wage. During expansionary times the private sector would bid labor out of the job program and during recessionary times labor would fall back into the job program. The job guarantee would moderate economic cycles and build a productive national workforce.  MMTers generally believe there is much available space for federal spending before real resource capacity is fully utilized--the point at which inflationary pressures begin to build. There are examples which back their view. Japan has struggled with deflationary pressures since the 1990s. During the past decade Japan has gone on a money creation binge which has resulted in a national debt to GDP ratio which approaches 240% more than double the U.S. ratio of debt to GDP. Yet Japan's inflation rate still hovers around zero. In the U.S. despite vigorous efforts to the contrary the nation's central bank the Federal Reserve has been unable to achieve a 2% inflation target. Both of these examples demonstrate the strong deflationary forces present in the global economy: this provides space for expanded money creation.  Would a federal full employment jobs program have a long term inflationary impact? It is difficult to say. MMTers say no. To me the answer is not so clear. What is clear however is that if a ""healthy"" non-inflationary economy is dependent as it has been during previous decades on a pool of unemployed underemployed and low wage workers then the economy is either flawed in its design or we are using a wrong set of measurements. Current accounting measures facilitate private sector measurements of profits and losses but fail to account for the broader social gains and losses associated with such activity. We all know that full employment is better than non full employment. Yet inflation measures which are important for money supply management purposes have dictated a near constant state of unemployment. The possible exception to this general rule is WWII which essentially amounted to a full employment federal jobs program.  If inflation measures and private firm accounting practices which prevent full employment violate that which we know to be true i.e. full employment is better than unemployment then it is time to create new measurements and accounting practices which better reflect the reality of what is happening in the broader national economy.  MMT offers accommodation to capitalist national economies with free floating sovereign currencies. Capitalists ought to embrace MMT ideas because capitalism will not survive its current form. If capitalism does not embrace necessary reform one variant of which MMT represents the other direction involves increasing social discontent oppression and violence. Few people capitalist or non capitalist want to wander down this path.  If the MMT plan were put into place and it were to prove unworkable due to inflationary pressures then either a new set of measurements and accounting practices should be developed which reflect the broader gains achieved through a guaranteed full employment program or the economy would need other radical restructuring which ensures a decent standard of living for all people.",political,Facebook
One narrative throughout this pandemic that has stuck me as very odd was this narrative of sacrificing the elderly and vulnerable to reopen the economy. You'd think the party that railed against fictional death panels would show more compassion during this crisis.  Right now the GOP is working to repeal the ACA during a this emergency. It's time to look at Medicaid Expansion. It's time to work on providing stability not just for Okaloosans but all Floridians. Let's fix our unemployment system strengthen it.  Let's get people back to work sensibly safely. A working unemployment system would have helped facilitate this. Let's pull together to build solutions to help those affected by this crises to rebound.,political,Facebook

The newly engaged co-anchors claimed they had texts and phone records from Trump advisers threatening to publish the Enquirer article if the pair did not contact Trump directly. The president apparently sought an apology for the couples unfavorable news coverage. Trump is a long-time friend and ally of David Pecker the publisher of the National Enquirer and had leveraged the relationship before. The Enquirer then published a hit piece on Scarborough and Brzezinskis relationship.  268.  June 30 2017  For the position of senior adviser in the Office of Gender Equality and Womens Empowerment Donald Trump appointed an activist who led a campaign to restrict transgender access to bathrooms. Under the Obama Administration the Office of Gender Equality supported LGBT empowerment both domestically and abroad.

While the White House subsequently denied Trump had used the words AIDS and huts it did not deny the overall description of the meeting.  271.  June 2017  The Trump International Hotel in Washington D.C. received $270000 in payments from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for rooms catering and parking as part of a lobbying effort. This violates the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution which forbids government officials from accepting any present Emolument Office or Title of any kind whatever from any King Prince or foreign State. Donald Trump has retained an ownership interest in his businesses and thus could receive payments from foreign states. 239.

"I believe that every life is precious and that we are truly created in God's image. That's why I have always been proud to be pro-life and pro-first responder. We should mourn any loss of life be it from COVID-19 influenza heart disease homicide suicide or accident. We should also appreciate those dedicated to saving lives be it healthcare workers or our first responders in law enforcement fire and rescue. Protecting innocent life is one of the most noble careers imaginable and it's a core role of any civilized society. But what happens when the pursuit of ""public health"" starts to possibly do more harm than good to a society?  It has now been five months since Texas and the nation were first asked to make sacrifices for ""three weeks to flatten the curve. Those first weeks have now turned into six months. We have watched for half a year as COVID-19 has been cited as a reason to shut down our economy disrupt millions of lives and limit our liberties.  Followers of this page have seen my concerns and questions grow as more data has become available. The COVID-19 data we are shown has been unreliable at best but we have been assured that government agencies and local health departments are working to clear up backlogs and true-up the numbers.  Last weekend the CDC posted that only 6% of our nation's COVID-19 deaths were caused exclusively from the virus meaning that 94% were deaths with additional factors such as diabetes or heart disease. In fact the average co-morbidity factor is 2.6 for underlying conditions in those who have died meaning there are more than one additional (non-COVID-19) causes for the death. This is alarming news especially when combined with other questions about the reliability of testing and the calculation of positivity rates.  It is time to refocus on the vulnerable populations who are at serious risk from COVID-19 and let others live their life to its fullest potential. This pandemic has eagerly been used by some as a way to ""reset"" and ""reimagine"" our society or inflict unnecessary pain to impact a November election. The restrictions of the several months are perhaps the most devastating policy initiatives in our lifetime.  I am encouraged to report that beginning next Tuesday 69 of the 70 school districts that I represent in Senate District 18 will be open for traditional in-person face-to-face instruction with 66 of those districts already having been opened at last week or more. We should thank the staff administrators school boards and especially the teachers for their hard work and dedicated effort to return a sense of normalcy to our children's learning environment.  Today it seems as if fear and misinformation are more threatening to our world than COVID-19 itself ever was. We must move on from the panic that has paralyzed so much of our society. Let's take the measures needed to protect our vulnerable populations but let's also find a real way to allow people to visit their loved ones in nursing homes assisted living facilities and state supported living centers. Let's acknowledge that every business is essential to someone and reevaluate the effectiveness of so-called lockdowns.  Its time that we live in a free society again as the US Constitution envisioned. We can coexist with COVID-19 and return to a world of liberty prosperity faith and family but only if the ongoing response and restrictions have not destroyed all we hold dear. We can work together to find solutions using common sense. We simply need faith to triumph over fear right now because bad data and undue panic only lead to bad decisions. We will find a way forward because we are Texans and we are indeed created in God's image. And no mask or virus can ever hide that truth.",political,Facebook
"[From the Bernie Sanders Campaign today with the subject ""Joe Biden""]  Dear Friends  Yes. These are crazy times. We're dealing with a pandemic an economic meltdown the struggle for racial justice and we're seeing the destruction caused by climate change in Iowa California Louisiana and Texas.  But in the midst of all of this we have got to remain focused focused focused. In 65 days the most important election in modern American history will be taking place and we have got to defeat Donald Trump. We have got to defeat him not only because he is a pathological liar because he rejects science and because he is a racist and a xenophobe. We have got to defeat him because he is undermining American democracy and is rapidly moving this country into an authoritarian type of society something we may never recover from.  In terms of defeating Trump one of the issues that has not gotten the attention that it deserves is the real contrast that exists between Trump's economic agenda and the economic proposals being supported by Joe Biden. At a time when our country is struggling with the worst economic meltdown since the great depression this is an issue of enormous consequence for tens of millions of working class families.  Let me be clear. Biden's economic agenda is not mine and does not go as far as I and many of you wish it would. But on the other hand at a time of massive and growing income and wealth inequality there is no question but that his proposals are strong and will go a long long way toward improving life for working families.  Yesterday I made an important speech about this issue on our social media channels. Let me summarize here what I said about Joe's plans for the economy.  Minimum Wage When Joe Biden is president he will increase the federal minimum wage from a starvation wage of $7.25 an hour to a living wage of $15 an hour. And lets be clear: When we increase that minimum wage to $15 an hour we will be raising the wages of more than 40 million workers.  Unions Joe Biden also knows that if we are going to expand the middle class in this country we must make it easier for workers to join unions engage in collective bargaining and end the heavy-handed corporate tactics that make it hard for workers to unionize in America.  Infrastructure And here's something else that Joe Biden understands. And that is that in the midst of the worst economic crisis in our lifetimes we need to create millions of good-paying jobs through a massive investment in rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure  our roads bridges sidewalks schools water systems and affordable housing.  Paid Family and Medical Leave Like most of us Joe Biden is embarrassed that the United States is the only major nation on earth not to guarantee paid medical and family leave. Thats why Joe has proposed at least 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave for working families.  Childcare And when we talk about babies and young children we all know that our current childcare system is totally inadequate. Our children and their parents deserve high-quality reliable and affordable childcare. Thats why Joe has proposed universal pre-K education for every 3- and 4-year-old in the country.  Colleges And when we talk about making sure that we have the best educated workforce in the world Joe understands that we need to make public colleges universities and trade schools tuition-free for working families.  Prescription Drugs As some of you may recall last year I traveled to Canada with a group of diabetics to buy insulin a life and death drug for more than 30 million Americans. And here's what we found. You can buy insulin in Canada a few miles from our border for 1/10th the price that it is sold here. No. You didn't mishear me. The same product made by the same company is sold for 1/10th the price that it's sold here. But it's not just Canada and its not just insulin. While the drug companies through their collusion price fixing and greed make obscene profits we pay by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. Joe Biden understands that we must take on the pharmaceutical industry and significantly lower drug prices in this country.  Health Care As many of you know the United States is the only major country not to guarantee health care for all people. Meanwhile despite paying almost twice as much per capita for health care as the people of other countries over 90 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured and over half a million Americans go bankrupt because they cannot afford to pay their medical bills.  While Joe and I disagree on the best path to get to universal coverage his proposal will greatly expand access to health care and make it more affordable for tens of millions across this country.  My friends of course many of us wish our campaign would have won the Democratic primary. But now our first priority must be to defeat Donald Trump the most dangerous president in modern American history.  Then on Day 1 of the Biden administration we will mobilize the working families of this country to demand a government that represents all of us and not just the few.  So I am asking you today to do something important  because Donald Trump and the Republican Party would love nothing more than to divide our supporters up as people start to vote. And the truth is the corporate media would love nothing more than to write stories about how we are not united in the fight to beat Trump.  So I am asking:  Add your name: help me send a message that you are committed to voting to defeat Donald Trump this November. This is important.  We live in the wealthiest nation in the history of the world but that reality means very little because almost all of that wealth is controlled by a tiny handful of individuals.  This November we take the first step to turn that around and to create a government that works for all of us and not just the 1 percent.  In solidarity  Bernie Sanders",political,Facebook
HEALTH CARE I support any and all initiatives that push the needle toward greater access to health care whether that be expanding MaineCare or if ever there is political momentum to do so implementing statewide single-payer health care possibly funded by a payroll tax for Maine's largest employers. If Maine had universal health care for all residents Maine would become a destination for residency employers would benefit by attracting the best and highest-qualified workers (by virtue of being in a state that provides health care) and the economy would grow helping the state to realize greater revenue.,political,Facebook
     Taunton MAToday Kelly Dooner candidate for Taunton City Council proudly announced that Mayor Shaunna OConnell has endorsed her candidacy.  We have worked hard over the past year to move Taunton forward. It is important to me that we have leaders who want to work for the greater good of the people. Kelly Dooner shares that same vision. Which is why I am proud to endorse her candidacy said Mayor OConnell.  Mayor OConnell was sworn into office in January of 2020. With less than 100 days in office our city was hit with the pandemic. Despite the new challenges OConnell was able to work with the City Council to implement many reforms.  Mayor OConnell has done an outstanding job for the people of Taunton. I am thrilled and honored to have her endorsement said Dooner. On the Council I will follow in her footsteps to make positive changes that will move our city forward.  Like OConnell Dooner supports funding a new public safety building and giving our police the tools they need to do their job.  I am going to raise a family here. It is imperative that our children and seniors are safe in our neighborhoods added Dooner.  Dooner has received several major endorsements for her City Council race including Rosemary Heath and City Council President Chris Coute.  Dooners platform includes: Reviving the local economy and helping grow local jobs; Strengthening public safety; Keeping Taunton affordable; Helping seniors and veterans; and Transparency the people come first.,political,Facebook
"People are starting to feel the pinch of inflation this is a common situation when too much money is printed and thrown into the system. What you will likely see next is your credit card and other interest rates start to rise as they now try to pull some of that money out. That will in turn drive up the national debt and the interest rate we pay on that debt will rise. This is the spiral that is caused with excess spending and borrowing. This has been driven by both parties in recent years from corporate bailouts to welfare programs to just over all wasteful spending and overestimating the benefit of revenue cuts. THIS MUST STOP. I hope people will remember what really caused the fall of the Soviet Union The following is cut from the encyclopedia Britannica:  ""By some measures the Soviet economy was the worlds second largest in 1990 but shortages of consumer goods were routine and hoarding was commonplace. It was estimated that the Soviet black-market economy was the equivalent of more than 10 percent of the countrys official GDP. Economic stagnation had hobbled the country for years and the perestroika reforms only served to exacerbate the problem. Wage hikes were supported by printing money fueling an inflationary spiral.""  Does any of this look familiar? We need to tap the breaks on spending and both parties are now addicted to it. We have to change the equation. We need to put people in congress that will practice some fiscal restraint. Hopefully you will decide I am such a person. Thanks!  Travis Bull Johnson",political,Facebook

"Ok Joe Joe Biden you win the ""nice guy award"" of the decade. Maybe even of the century. You are so nice so decent so compassionate . You sound so honest and sincere and caring and when you talk so softly you just make me want to cry. You arouse my sense of pity and bring out the human in me. we would otherwise all be so selfish and deplorables and irredeemables. You have ""empathy""  ""You reward work not wealth"". Did those that become wealthy not work.? Did they not create jobs ? You are an expert but an expert in dividing people. The poor against the rich and the blacks against whites. You are an expert in dividing one American against another.There is only at least 47 reasons that all you say is crap and complete lies ""make believe"" and ""demagoguery."" You have had 47 years to practice your hypocrisy and dirty politics and make yourself rich on the back of American workers that you betrayed for China and Mexico and other countries. You totally divided the people and destroyed the economy and jobs. Didn't you say that if you can go deep down in a mine you can also learn ""programming"" and ""coding"". You want to build the ""jobs of the future"" but you did that with your master Obama. Now we rely on China for almost everything essential including life saving medicines.You had 8 years as Vice President and betrayed America. Then prior to that you were a corrupt senator for almost 40 years. Now all of a sudden you will wave a magic wand and fix everything that you destroyed for 47 years. I am happy you found that magic wand that your master Obama did not find.Were you hiding the wand all this time ? You would be a curse to America if you get elected. You can say Trump is to blame for 190000 deaths from Covid but we would have lost millions of lives if you were in charge. Remember your calling him a "" xenophobe""when he banned travel from China ? You have not condemned the rioting and looting and anarchy until your handlers and the corrupt MSM told you that it was hurting you in the polls.

"Calling all musicians stagehands production workers venue owners security workers street teamers venue staff and anyone negatively affected by Governor Jim Justice unconstitutional Executive Order 56-20 banning live music in West Virginia. The rest of the country has figured it out and are hosting events with 6 ft spacing pods tables and even drive-in movie shows while West Virginia is once again last. We are the only state in the country with such a nonsensical ban on an entire industry while watching similar industries be allowed to continue. The Governor's website currently has guidelines set into place for 64 different business and leisure categories but can't give the live music industry workers the same respect to safely go back to work? The industry is dying fast and our livelihoods are at stake. Live entertainment also helps so many West Virginians with their mental health which our Governor states he cares so much about. He also stresses the local economy which live entertainment creates so much revenue for other local and state businesses. This simly is an industry that can not afford to be ignored any longer. West Virginia Bands Together is calling for the immediate lift on the ""ban"" of outdoor live entertainment in the Mountain State and to have guidelines set in place reverting to the Governor's original mandate set in March of up to 50% occupancy with maximum cap of 250 people as long as they follow the 6 ft spacing. If the Governor has not set a reasonable maximum capacity number and a set of guidelines for us to follow by October 1st we will be organizing peaceful but noisy protests around the stadium this upcoming gameday. March details like starting point will be issued closer to the protest. If you are a musician that has been silenced over the last 6 months please get your instruments ready to make some noise. If you can not make it to Morgantown on game day then we are looking for other local leaders to help organize a meaningful protest in your town. We want to hear every musician and band making some noise all over the state this Saturday. We can not be silenced any longer by this unconstitutional order.

Andy Klitzke: No to the Bridge Yes to Red Wing Families  A well-respected member of our community wrote a letter expressing her disagreement with placing a pedestrian bridge on Old West Main street to the harbor. I concur. If I am elected I will vote no. I will also eliminate other wasteful spending to find real tax savings for Red Wing families.  I will not stop there. I will work to have the old St Johns Hospital torn down and restore the area to single family homes and green space that fits our historic neighborhood. Ive listened to my neighbors and that is what they really want. The old hospital had its day now it is time to demolish it and start fresh. If I am elected I will get it done.  She also mentioned her concern about rising taxes and the empty storefronts downtown. I share her fears. I will build trust with the other council members by showing up for meetings and carrying my share of the responsibilities. I will use the budget workshop meetings as a chance to build consensus by actively contributing to real solutions that result in a trimmer budget that receives majority support.  There have been past unsuccessful attempts at filling our downtown storefronts. It is time for a Manhattan Project kind of commitment to economic development that brings together city and county government with business owners and residents to make possible the widespread community understanding and support needed to confront the problem and find real solutions.  My plan includes lobbying for state revitalization funds providing incentives to attract new business and to remodel the second floors downtown that remain empty. I also plan to secure long-term contracts with the riverboat companies that will give business owners confidence to invest in our downtown.  I need your vote to cut the budget lower your taxes restore the old hospital area and fill our downtown storefronts.  I take the tough issues facing our city very seriously. The challenge of re-building our economy will be met by committed community leaders working toward the same goal. I hope to be a part of that effort.  To the voters of Red Wing: I may not always have an immediate solution but I will always get back to you. A call email or letter sharing your concerns will always get a response.

"DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM  I am a democratic socialist lowercase intended. Most who engage this Page are of a fairly conservative persuasion. Consequently the above statement is likely to generate controversy. But that is not the intent of the statement. The intent of the statement is to provide an opportunity to state what it means to be a democratic socialist untarnished by a false portrayal of the term by those with an agenda which runs contrary to the broad mass of the American people.  First let me say to my conservative brothers and sisters I understand many of your positions. I am from a family which are conservative fundamentalists Christian on one side while the other side is best described as liberal establishment. I know both sides to be loving people authentic in their hearts and are well-intended with regards to the future of our Nation. I understand where both sides are coming from.  I consider myself however a part of neither of the above camps although certainly my thoughts are more closely aligned with the liberal establishment. But I reject the liberal establishment as they like the conservative fundamentalists defend an economic system: capitalism which is premised on materialism and competition both of which have led us to devalue human life in favor of soul sapping endless consumption rather than strong national and international communities. Both of the major U.S. political parties support war Wall Street big business and both continue to support a capitalist ideology which creates many of the divisions within our Nation.  For this reason I am a democratic socialist. To many the term socialism is deemed as a threat to one's freedom. But this threat does not exist so let's clear-up this misperception. For most people who are content with their daily lives who work regular jobs who own small businesses democratic socialism is not a threat to your freedom or way of life. I know of no one who wants to take away your small businesses: that would be both inefficient and undemocratic--small businesses are often defined as businesses with 500 or fewer employees.  There comes a point in time however when a business becomes so large that their largeness is no longer a mere reflection of the firm's merit but is a demonstration of an ability by large corporate enterprise to successfully leverage the Nation's assets: assets which they did not build i.e. education transportation networks security apparatuses culture: public assets for which the public should receive an equitable return on investment. Are CEOs on Wall Street at the tech giants the auto firms and elsewhere really worth tens of millions in annual compensation? Perhaps to their specific firm yes; but to the broader national economy? Are not restaurant workers worth more than their measly wage and do not auto and steel plant workers deserve a greater share of the National product? These are the issues which democratic socialist seek to address.  Democratic socialism is a highly nuanced term and there are as many interpretations of the title as there are people who think about it. To date unfortunately the term socialism has misleadingly been defined by those most threatened by the movement: the well-off and the upper management class. They would have us believe that socialism in America would look like that which occurred in the former Soviet Union which was not democratic or in modern day Cuba or Venezuela whose success or non success we will never be able to judge because they were unable to operate free of being undermined by the U.S. other western nations and reactionary forces within their own borders. Any movement towards a socialist system will develop out of the historical forces then present in the given society. In the U.S. this will involve markets and strong civil liberties. The thing that would fundamentally change is a desire to create a system which works for the entire population with a recognition that capitalism's individual survival-of-the-fittest mindset will not get us there.  Socialism seeks greater democracy not less. It seeks to shift power downward towards the middle and poorer classes. To my democratic socialist way of thinking ""the people"" should share control over the J.P. Morgans Citigroups Goldman Sachs . . . Googles and General Motors of the world. This would shift the center of power away from the well-off who due to their wealth exercise a degree of power and control over the Nation which far exceeds the power of their individual votes. This is both undemocratic and unhealthy. The undemocratic concentration of power among the well-off needs to be pushed downward towards the middle and poorer classes and this can only be accomplished if this grouping owns a significant chunk of these large corporations. Equity ownership in these firms with board representation will enable public oversight of these massive firms which daily impact our lives. By default stock ownership with board representation in these large firms will enable greater democratic control over the future of the Nation.  It seems to me that the most efficient way to achieve broader control over these large and powerful economic bodies which have successfully leveraged public assets and average people is through federal ownership stakes in large business enterprises. Perhaps there are better ways to restructure the ownership of these firms but given our current institutional framework federal ownership stakes in large corporations seems to be the quickest path to a more equitable power sharing arrangement. If you have alternative ideas feel free to comment on them. Democratic socialism does not seek to limit your freedoms it seeks to strengthen your freedoms through shifting power from the top tiers of society into the hands of middle and poorer classes through ownership stakes in large powerful private institutions.  Let me state clearly there is no effort here to impugn the character of the rich or wealthy. They like the rest of us are subjects of ideology and circumstances which largely direct our trajectories. I would no more judge a wealthy person than I would judge a crack cocaine dealer on the street. None of us can peer into another's heart. We are talking about systemic issues: foundational ideas which shape the world. As a nation we spend far too much time judging individual members of the opposition rather than in judgement of the broad ideological forces which drive human behavior.  Democratic socialist want strong civil liberties full employment and an assured decent standard of living for all. We do not want to raise tax rates on the middle classes. If this requires redistribution from those who have received a far greater share than what they have individually contributed to the National economy I don't see a problem with this. They after all have been redistributing wealth and income away from the middle and poorer classes for decades. If we are to call ourselves a nation then there must be something we share in common other than national boundaries; we should equitably share power and the National product. We and our ancestors have all contributed to America Inc. this includes the unemployed which have wrongly to date served to keep wage rates down in order to facilitate corporate profits: wage rates which are dictated through monetary policy by the Nation's central bank--the Federal Reserve.  Democratic socialism does not seek to limit your freedoms it seeks to strengthen your freedoms through shifting power from the top tiers of society into the hands of the middle and poorer classes through ownership stakes in large powerful private institutions. It is the democratic thing to do.",political,Facebook

Jimmy Walker's profundity  Many years ago I heard Jimmy Walker of Good Times fame say that poverty doesn't cause crime crime causes poverty. There are many poor persons in the United States and around the world who do not turn to a life of crime simply because they are poor. They respect others their property and understand that it is wrong to violate others simply because of the circumstances they find themselves in.  Being poor doesn't make a person commit murder. Being poor doesn't make a person do drugs especially since doing drugs is such an expensive habit. Being poor doesn't make a person steal or destroy the property of others. Being poor doesnt make a person ignore the humanity of others. Those who claim poverty makes them commit crimes or self-destructive acts are simply copping out because it is just as easy to decide not to commit these acts as it is to decide to do them. Free will always rules.  In order for a community to survive financially and otherwise it is essential for businesses and other institutions to have a welcoming and safe atmosphere in which to flourish. Those who choose to open a business that will not only provide jobs to the locals but also creates a way for the locals to fulfill their daily needs do so out of free will. Being able to walk across the street to the grocery store is very important to many as we have seen expressed by those who saw their local businesses burned to the ground during the recent and ongoing lunacy.  Politicians are all the time saying they are going to pass job creating legislation. Well heres the bad news. The government cant pass legislation and then jobs magically appear. That is a good political soundbite and it may garner a few votes but job creation doesnt work that way. That only occurs in a market of free exchange that develops into a system that fulfills the needs of the locals. It takes time to develop that system and an unwelcoming or unsafe atmosphere will cause the local system to never reach its full potential and if that system is destroyed once established it will never come back as it was. The lives of the locals will forever be changed for the worst.  This brings us to the purpose of this post which is the insanity of leftists who are demanding that the police be abolished. Any government that eliminates the police department will be saying to businesses and other institutions that are essential to a vibrant and bustling local economy that they need not apply. Businesses are the personal property of the owners they are not community property and they choose where to setup shop. Eliminating the police would be a message to all citizens and property owners that their property and persons are not important enough to protect and it will cause a massive exodus of citizens investment and tax base that will destroy the local economy.

The supply chain problems we are having is directly attributed to the reaction to the economic downturn caused by the COVID pandemic. Our government generally stimulates the economy through three methods all of which causes the debt to rise. The first method is to cut taxes to put more money in the private economy. Trump and the GOP did this at a time that in my opinion the economy did not need stimulus. It did make the economy grow but disproportionately benefitted wealthier Americans. The second way the government stimulates the economy is by giving cash directly to Americans. This is a very effective way giving the economy a quick boost but also causes overheating and can lead to shortages and inflation. Both the previous administration and the current one did this which helped prevent a recession. Unfortunately the Democrats doubled down on direct infusion and gave money to parents of young children who are the most likely to use it to buy things. This has caused a huge demand for products manufactured in Asia at a time that the shipping industry hasnt fully recovered capacity. Basically the supply line crises is caused by an economic policy that worked to well. The biggest problem with all of this money going out to parents is it has enabled them to not work. All of this borrowed money is going straight to manufactured goods from Asia while our Service Economy is struggling with a labor shortage. The third way the government stimulates the economy is by spending it on public projects like the proposed infrastructure bill. This type of stimulus is a slower but more measured way for money to be injected into the economy. In addition it has the added benefit of building enduring investments that help maintain the economy in the future.,political,Facebook
***ECONOMIC COMMUNITY CENTERS -- A REAL IDEA TOWARD OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL***  We hear a lot of talk about the income and opportunity gap and small business support and workforce development. But with current leadership it's as broad as that with no real ideas and no track record for actually building a program that can do it.  I've built a concept to address workforce and small businesses support called Economic Community Centers and are developing it with local municipalities. Click here for the detailed plan:  An Economic Community Center is a hub for existing economic resources in the area from jobs and work programs to entrepreneurial and start-up support. Directing users to job training career upskilling and resources on entrepreneurship small business programs and independent contracting a growing and essential element of today's economy.  The result would be a community of converging economic interests empowering each other with modeling and mentoring a key component.  This is the type of economic policy we need based on diverse first-hand experience in the evolving global economy and a practical way to make it function. This is my background and it will be one my primary focuses from the State House.  I would be working for you the people of District 114 and I take that very seriously. I humbly ask for your vote on Nov. 3.  Best regards Brad Jayne  Email me at brad@bradforsc.com with questions and comments. Check out more of our plans and policies at .,political,Facebook
My stance is very clear. I oppose any tax and/or utility rate increases unless it is absolutely vital for the Towns survival. The vote to approve any such increase would not be taken lightly nor without long thoughtful consideration. I believe it is councils job to be good stewards of our tax revenue. If the council needs more revenue I do not find it fair to simply lay that burden onto the taxpayer without alternative options being presented. Of course we need revenue to operate the Town. Council should focus on tax incentives and business incentives to attract the startup of new businesses into our Town. The increase in taxation or utilities is a huge deterrent for any new business. The small business is the life of our economy and we should incentivize them to stay in our Town and to invite their friends! Lets get a positive business platform instead of raise taxes raise rates raise utilities. This train of thought hurts the most vulnerable in our community and I think it is high time we take into consideration the entire community - not just the few on top. #voteplasterforapositiveandpromisingfuture #GOPRed,political,Facebook
Hypocritical much?  You know I spent many years avoiding politics on social media because well who really wants to be voluntarily attacked? Thats the problem with todays society opposing views are condemned instead of just understanding their path in life was different and thats what lead to their ideals. I saw a comment the other day that a liberal didnt like talking to her conservative friends anymore...well same because conservatives are labeled has callous and racist somehow? Fun fact a republican president ended slavery...  This the the hypocrisy that I have issues with liberals about:  1. You condemn Trump for his alleged affairs but Clinton admitted to having an affair in the Oval Office.  2. You call Melania weak and a puppet for staying with Trump but you put Hillary on pedestal for her resilience and strong nature for staying with Bill.  3. You spent two years trying to prove Russia interfered with the election and that we need stricter enforcements but want mail in voting. (Because obviously that is the most efficient way to make sure every vote is counted AND that it is not fraudulent).  4. Raising minimum wage does not put America first or create more jobs...increasing minimum wage increases the most expensive part of COGS already so it makes the increase moot AND makes American manufacturers have to produce overseas to be competitive in the market. (In case you dont understand that it closes American factories losing jobs not gaining).  5. You condemn Trump for not doing enough to stop the pandemic but called him racist when he closed the travel borders to slow the spread. Your solution to the problem is passing a bill but you refuse to negotiate a reasonable bill before the election because it will boost the economy and Trumps re-election.  6. You blame Trump for the current stimulus bill that is stalled but Congress is the one with more power and they went on vacation. You also condemned him for forcing the EDD benefits and forcing the states to take some responsibility...and why shouldnt they the states are shutting down the economy not the federal government. -Also any individuals accepting the additional $300 that curses Trumps name when he is the only reason you are getting something additional...your leaders would rather do nothing than at least pass legislation that does have consensus you should ask them why!  7. Biden calling this Trumps Recession when the reality of the recession is from California being shutdown not something Trump did. California is the 5th largest economy in the WORLD all of its own if you dont understand that is the largest thing hindering our economy right now you didnt pay attention in high school.  8. His tax returns...quite frankly I could care less. Every single American does everything they can to pay the least amount of taxes possible so why this is so important to Democratics is beyond me. You know one of the reasons Biden pays so much in taxes? His lack of charitable contributions...and Trump is donating his entire Presidential salary to charity so go figure.  Another fun fact: Trump was nominated twice for the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize for the recent Israeli-UAE-Bahrain peace talks.  My point is not to deter you from your beliefs it is to say that neither side is perfect. Trump is an average American in terms of his speaking but whether you want to admit it or not hes a pretty good businessman. It took a pandemic and world shutdown to stop the economic growth we were experiencing in the US. The only reason we have not recovered as much as we should is the continued shutdown of California and a few other states. COVID is real the sensationalism and fear is not but history has shown that when the economy is good an incumbent President is 100% re-elected. So the hate that dems have for Trump is greater than the health and stability of our nation thats not American.  Disclaimer: I do not agree with everything that Trump says but I in no way wish for his failure because we all fail when that happens no matter who is that office.  May God Bless our Country over the next few weeks as more hate and negativity is spread during these elections.  ,political,Facebook
Happy Solstice Day + 1! Happy Holidays! Thank you to our clients - We couldnt be here without you!  So Happy Solstice Day + 1! The significance of this observation - summer is on the way. Yea! The shortest day of the year just passed but winter will be with us a for a couple more months. That is fine armed with the knowledge the days are getting longer. I feel the sun light deprivation and I am just not as chipper as I normally feel. What a trying year 2020 has been. The beginning of the year was so promising the market was at all-time highs and the economy was showing signs of acceleration. Then boom! The pandemic hit. The best adjective holy cow? In my 36 year career I have seen nothing like it. I have seen bear markets: 1987 9/11 and the Great Financial Crisis. I have also seen bull markets longer than a decade. Just never have I seen what has happened this year - all within 10 months. Throw in a hotly contested election social unrest and quarantines. Wow! No wonder we are all tired. Congratulations 2020 in almost over. I am reminded of an old sailors story. On my first deep sea fishing excursion I decided to go below as a nearby storm was causing big swells in the ocean. It must have been clear that I was not feeing particularly well when an old sailor followed me below. He told me how sailors when feeling seasick have always made their way to the deck to look to the horizon. While that doesnt prevent the pitch and drop of the waves in the storm it is somehow less upsetting if the larger context is kept in view. I have kept this wisdom close to me when pitched in a storm. In truth whether facing a bear market or riding out a storm it is somehow less upsetting if the larger context is kept in view. My greatest pains and fears have been lessened when I have managed to keep the largest sense of life before me like a horizon. This is the difference between despair and faith between the narrow point of doubt and a view long enough to sustain. It seems we suffer more when huddled below the horizon doesnt remove us from our storms but it does make things bearable. Thanks to Solstice Day + 1 for reminding me summer will return. Thanks to our clients for helping me to see the horizon. The US economy will rebound calmer seas ahead. Enjoy the dayr2,political,Facebook
"I support the Renewable Portfolio Standard to ensure that more electricity generation comes from renewable energy. In fact we can do ever better by ensuring that ALL of our electricity comes from renewable sources. I have hammered this home because the possibility is right there within our reach regardless of those who hem and haw that ""we can't."" We can transition to 100% renewable energy within 10 years because we have the capacity right here in our state to do so. We have the knowledge and expertise here in Maine to convert to 100% renewable energy from offshore floating wind turbines within 10 years producing 156 GW per year. The plan developed by the University of Maine's Advanced Structures and Composites Center should be fast-tracked IMMEDIATELY to realize this level of energy production within 10 years to the benefit of Maine's economy which could realize up to $20 million per year in revenue of sale of this electricity to other states (Maine will only need 3 GW of that energy per year).

I work to deliver for you and our district. On education: During the pandemic I supported funding 100% of the per-student formula which is the states contribution to local schools regardless of virtual or in-person instruction. And in the last session I also supported adding $763 million to public education which was the largest K-12 investment in Indiana history. Also 94% of Indiana teachers received an average of $2160 per teacher.  On quality-of-life issues: I supported doubling the penalties for those irritating robocalls you get. So while my opponent has her campaign text you on your cellphone I have always done the hard work since 2015. On jobs. The economy. COVID-19. Education. Healthcare. Energy. Life.

Congress: How should you decide who to vote for?  I hear with regularity those who say they vote for the best person the one who will best represent them. That may have worked in the past but those days are long gone because the two major political parties have become too irreconcilably opposed to each other. These days what any particular individual running for Congress claims to support is nearly irrelevant because whether or not that person supports what you want there are 534 others who do not. When 320 million Americans elect 535 individuals to Congress they are electing a diffusion of power. The only power that exists and that which drives policy exists among those in the power positions and their lieutenants all those left are simply votes in support of those in power. Those in power decide the direction of their political party.  Thats why it is imperative to consider which party you want to give power to because supporting the very individual that you think is the best person for the job may well give power to those who will destroy everything important to you. The majority party in each chamber of Congress controls all of the levers of power in that chamber and sets the agenda for it. You must consider carefully which party you want to see in power.  Currently the Democrat party openly supports nearly everything destructive to this country the greatest country to ever exist. It is clear by their actions and what they support that they hate this country. They want to turn violent criminals back onto the streets. They want to eliminate our borders and put illegal aliens on welfare and turn them into voters. They openly support all of the rioting looting and destruction of property all across this country.  They support economic policies that are antagonistic toward businesses and tax payers and that will destroy our economy. Their Green New Deal will destroy our energy industry and put us in the same situation as California. California has rejected reliable energy while embracing windmills and solar panels which has caused its people to have to choose between running their air conditioners or everything else in their homes. Their blackouts and brownouts are regular and dependable. Now California wants to ban the sale of new vehicles by 2035. That is sheer lunacy. Some in California like to say that California leads the way for the rest of the United States. Study California well because if the Democrats are elected to power the rest of the country will end up just like it..headed toward third world status.,political,Facebook
"""The Psychology of Trump-Haters""  Whats happening in America right now shouldnt come as a surprise to anyone. It could be spotted from miles away!  As a psychologist watching the political back and forth in the USA over the past 5 years is pretty incredible. Seeing people say what theyve said behaved in the way theyve behaved and made the decisions theyve made has been interesting to watch. Its also illuminated a very clear truth.  The reason why Trump-haters hate Trump so much is not because they actually hate Trump the person. Because they dont even know him. Theyre definitely not protesting Trumps competence or political policies. Because well lets face it he did an incredible job with our economy protected the people inside the country with strong borders and won the respect of so many around the world. Allies felt supported. Enemies knew not to mess. Prospects knew to tread carefully. And he did it all so confidently unabashedly unapologetically. How attractive!  So the question remains if its not his personality and its not his policies what is it? Notice that people who have been critical of Trump tend to be very reactionary in their position. Its a highly emotional topic for them. It stirs up a lot. Interestingly the reaction has been so powerful and pervasive that it even has its own syndrome!  And therein lies the answer to this question. The people who have been so vehemently opposed to Trump are not really against Trump. Theyre upset at what Trump triggers deep inside them. That is what they're reacting to when they hear ""Trump."" Trump reminds many of the unprocessed anger they have towards authority figures in their lives. Maybe an angry father. Perhaps a controlling mother. Possibly an abusive boss. For many people the idea of Trump has woken (no pun intended) up tremendous emotional pain and psychological trauma that these people have not dealt with. And that they have not wanted to deal with.  Psychologically-speaking thats how we got here. Thats why so many picked Biden. I put it in quotes because they didnt really pick Biden. They just wanted to escape Trump. Or I should say the painful memories that Trump stirred up inside them. Was Trump opinionated? Of course he was. Was he outlandish in his delivery at times? Absolutely. Did he come across as arrogant and egotistical at points? Without question. Its all true!!!  But objectively that is what you want in a President of the USA. That is what you want from your Commander in Chief. That is what you want from the guy whos sole responsibility and duty is to go up to bat for you. You want someone who will unabashedly stand up for you guard you and protect your interests with everything hes got when it comes down to the wire.  The truth is to guard and protect properly sometimes you have to be bold. You have be direct. You have to be aggressive. Otherwise some wont hear you. They will not respect you. They will manipulate you. And they will walk all over you.  To the Trump haters I feel for you. Living this way must be complete emotional hell. Because youre always on the run. Your life is driven by fear. You make decisions that are based in anxiety and avoidance. Youre constantly looking to make choices not that you necessarily personally believe in but because they are less triggering. And unfortunately sometimes it leads to this. The truth about Biden is clear to everyone now. At least it should be. He was never fit to be a leader in this capacity. The writing was on the wall from the very beginning. Some decided to see it. Others were too scared to. Because it stirred up too much. Its okay. You didnt know.  Hopefully this incident can be used as an opportunity for you to exercise the courage to look inside and see what your triggers in life actually are. Consider. Who talked down to you growing up? Who hurt you? Who made you feel so little ? Pay attention to it. Process it. Address it.  You will see better. Decide better. And live better.",political,Facebook
Last year after the pandemic shut down many of our local businesses the City of Soldotna pushed to get $5.9 million back into the pockets of business owners nonprofits like Freedom House and Love Inc. and individual residents. Im proud of that and of all the work weve done to keep our city healthy and thriving during this challenging time.  Thats only some of the things weve done. Some of the others Ive been involved with include:  -Supporting the Shop Local: Spend $200 Get $100 which generated an estimated $1 million in new business sales a huge boost to the local Soldotna economy. -Distributing more than 7500 food bag and boxes through the Kenai Peninsula Food Bank. -Provided funding for people to get transportation to PCHS for mental health services or for them to receive telehealth services at home. -Providing mortgage and rent assistance to keep Soldotna residents in their homes.  Were not done either. We recently received another $1.1 million in federal aid that Im committed to see put into our community in the months to come. Community partnerships are essential for programs like these to succeed and community ideas make that stronger.

GUNS! Ive been chatting with many people in Augusta and gun rights have come up several times. Ive also received a pile of surveys from groups both for and against gun control most with misleading and unanswerable questions. Here is where I stand on guns. I am a gun owner. I inherited my two long guns from my dad and I have a pistol that I bought for the defense of my home. I believe that the 2nd Amendment provides Americans with a means to defend their country against tyranny and that guns can act a deterrent to home invasion crimes. Ill be keeping my guns and will defend the right of law abiding citizens to keep theirs as well. I also know that people with guns in their home are more likely to die from gunshot wounds because of the lack of safety measures. Its also hard for me to think of anything more terrible than a school shooting here in Augusta. And I know that domestic abusers and felons can purchase guns without a background check by going to a gun show or engaging in a private sale. And that angry people seeking vengeance can go purchase a gun without a waiting period. Some gun owners feel that its a slippery slope to have ANY limitations. If you give an inch theyll take a mile kind of thinking. I want other gun owners to know that in my time dealing with the Democratic party and listening to the different members and strategies I havent once heard any talk about a plan to take peoples guns. I think that the take peoples guns threat is an idea pushed by groups like the NRA to sway votes so that certain politicians can get to work making the rich richer and protecting corporate and other wealthy interests. The endless gun debate distracts people from the work of democracy. I say keep your guns. Keep your AR-10s and 15s and your semi-auto whatevers. Please keep them locked and unloaded if you have children in the home. Please make sure that other people dont have access to your guns. Thats part of responsible gun ownership.  I want to work with gun owners (like myself) and gun safety advocates (also me) to come together to make sure that gun owners have their rights protected but also have some common sense laws that protect our kids and protect people that are in abusive relationships. Lets get some common sense protections in place that we can all live with so we can get back to focusing on the economy healthcare senior issues and all the other important issues that we as Mainers face. I want to talk about guns when we are shooting at the range but there are other important things that we need to talk about too.,political,Facebook
Friends  Im pleased to launch my Facebook page in my campaign to be your next mayor of Santa Barbara.  My concern for the city's lack of clear mayoral leadership is what led my decision to enter the race. We need practical non-partisan and common-sense leadership to face our city's current challenges.  Currently Staff and uniformed public safety are not being supported by the Mayor in these critical times and we're facing a period with an interim Police Chief and City Administrator two of the most critical factors in the continuity of the city's organization.  I spent 37 years as a business owner and employer with a bird's eye view of City Hall and have worked with every Mayor and City Administrator during that period. I served on our City Council for the last 9 of those 37 years.  It's time we elect someone with experience and no political future. Let's bring Santa Barbara back to a clean safe and healthy environment and economy.  I would be honored by your support!,political,Facebook
"Bernie let's be clear if Trump gets re-elected all the ""progress"" you say you have made to destroy America will vanish. You are right what was once thought to be very radical is now become more mainstream. But what you think is progress and mainstream is exactly the opposite. It is moving backwards and extreme and denying history and the misery of your socialistic ideas and wishes. Raising taxes stifles the economy and jobs. Taking away incentives of free enterprise and entrepreneurship from doers and creators will slow growth and economic prosperity. People have come here from socialist and communist countries by the millions  not the other way around ! Capitalism has always been a better system than socialism and communism except for power hungry charlatans and demagogues who are fools and want to fool the innocent the unaware and naive and indifferent and the careless. The USSR was a complete failure just like Cuba and North Korea and Venezuela. China only prospered after Mao when they adopted free enterprise and capitalism.

Below is a short speech I wrote for the Wolfeboro Area Democrats rally in the garden of Edie and Paul Desmarais last Sunday August 30. It was a great event with six candidates speaking including Carrie Martin Duran who is also running for State Representative from Wolfeboro.  Hi Im John Wall. I am running from Wolfeboro for one of its two a seats in the New Hampshire state house. My focus is on Wolfeboro and its future development . There are a handful of public services are crucial for economic development and growth:  1) Education 2) Infrastructure 3) Social services  Providing public education is the single most important job of any local or state government. Wolfeboro has good quality education and local public support. This has not been easy particularly for the ten year period after the 2008 Great Recession when State revenues fell sharply. The New Hampshire state government pushed its revenue shortfalls down for the counties towns and school. districts. It took the Democrats flipping control of the House and Senate to increase State funding for education. But now we have the coronavirus to deal with. It adds to the costs of operating safe schools. State tax Revenues are again falling. I will work to make funds for education a priority.  One of Wolfeboros biggest infrastructure issues is broadband Internet. We all have come to use the Internet much more intensely since the beginning of this pandemic . We use it much more for work for education for entertainment for shopping and even consulting our doctors. Many of us have wished that our Internet connections were faster more reliable and less expensive. There are very different internet service standards and costs between urban and rural areas creating a digital divide. There was a electricity divide in the 1930s. Congress and state governments passed rural electrification programs to fix that. Congress and states funded our massive interstate highways system to cover the entire nation. Now is the time for Congress and states to fund a nationwide broadband access for every home. This is particularly important for the future development of Wolfeboro. This will allow Wolfeboro become a place more people choose to work young families choose to live and businesses want to invest. I want to go to Concord to move this program forward.  Wolfeboros and New Hampshires natural environment its one of the main things that make them very special places. We must keep our lovely lakes clean and their shore lines green. That requires good water sanitation and drainage. We have to invest in the environmental infrastructure needed. Wolfeboro has planned projects that have had to be postponed due to the state budgets.  Social services for the public in Wolfeboro are a patchwork with community  non-profits town county state and federal governments delivery rules and funding. Im talking about education health insurance unemployment  addiction family services child care and poverty. All of these basic needs are fundamental to maintaining ones dignity. There is not enough coordination between the various agencies. Wolfeboros highly seasonal economy means many families need a plan to pull together their family budgets. Wolfeboros small size and rural location make the availability of social services mean an hours drive or more each way.  The common problem behind all these issue is financing. The current government financing situation is full of turmoil and uncertainty. My vision for Wolfeboros development in beyond the current health and qeconomic crises. We will find a way to finance government services that the public strongly supports .  I dont have ready answers to these difficult problems. I do have lots of questions. If elected I intend to work long hard and smart for you in Concord.,political,Facebook

As a Family Physician I ask every patient I see how they are coping with this pandemic. Approximately half of the patients express to me how they are terrified about the prospect of getting infected. Most of these patients have not left their homes in 2 to 3 months except to go to the grocery store. They are extremely upset by people who are not taking this seriously enough and are threatening their well-being by not wearing a mask and not social distancing. Most of the rest of my patients are working but are severely limiting their interactions with other people and are extremely concerned about protecting families.  As a father and grandfather I rarely get to see my grandsons (7 abd 3) even though they live just two blocks away. My daughter insists that they maintain social distancing and wear masks when they come over to the yard to use our swingset and playhouse. We used to get together most weekends for breakfast and I would cook them bacon and Mickey Mouse pancakes. My youngest grandson has repeatedly said on the telephone or FaceTime how much he misses visiting us and my pancakes.  We need national leadership that provides clear guidelines based on medical facts and experts that do not rush to reopen before the parameters show that it is safe. We need leadership that does not make this pandemic a political football! Instead we need leadership like we have here in North Carolina with Gov. Cooper and Secretary Cohen. I believe that if our national leadership had followed the lead of these two great leaders we would have had 50% less deaths and would have been able to safely reopen our economy and schools.  Even though both of us are at high risk for complications from this virus my wife and I are trying to support those businesses and restaurants that are being responsible and making an extra effort to abide by the Governor's guidelines and directives by shopping and/or eating at their establishments. At the same time we are avoiding businesses and restaurants that are not being responsible as are most of our friends.  I firmly believe that the way out of this pandemic for our country is to follow great leaders like Gov. Cooper and Secretary Cohen  who remind us to faithfully keep wearing masks and socially distancing until this virus is brought under control. This is the only way to revive our economy and save lives.,political,Facebook

"Why didn't Donald Trump act on Covid-19?  United States: Population 330 million - 160000 dead from Covid-19 South Korea : Population 50 million - 300 dead from Covid-19  We saw what happened in China in January and Donald Trump took no action. We saw what happened in Europe in February and March and Donald Trump took no action. We were offered tests in January and Donald Trump took no action. Our economy has crashed. Millions have lost their jobs their savings and their homes. In every statistic we are doing worse than any other country. What did South Korea do differently? Testing. Testing testing testing. Many tests with fast results. When you can get tested you can know if you've got the virus and have to stay isolated or if you are clear and can go to work school or visit friends and family. That is how you stop the spread and at the same time keep the economy going.  But Donald Trump thought that giving attention to the virus would threaten his reelection chances. Like with everything else Donald Trump puts himself before the country.  There were approximately 781000 total deaths in the United States from March 1 to May 30 2020 representing 122300 more deaths than would typically be expected at that time of year. For the same period 95235 COVID-19 deaths were reported signaling that COVID-19 deaths are under-reported.  141 dead in South Dakota. That is one out of every 6000 South Dakotans. So far. 160000 dead in the United States. That is one out of every 2000 Americans. So far.  160000 dead. That is 50 times the death toll from 9/11 or three times more than the casualties in the Vietnam war.  Donald Trumps comment: ""It is what it is.""  And the republican party including Erin Tobin has nothing to say about it. Shameful.  #covid#coronavirus#corona#pandemic",political,Facebook
During these trying times including in relation to COVID-19 our families continue to face the obligation to pay their necessary bills such as their rent or mortgage. Therefore its imperative that we begin/continue the path to economic recovery with responsible and effective solutions to open our businesses back up. We cannot afford to keep businesses closed its hurting families including our children. Our families must work to avoid eviction or foreclosure and meet their other monthly financial needs. With that said and as your next Senator Lou Minnis will pursue solutions for our families to return back to work which will also support our economy going forward.,political,Facebook
The Biden administration and Democrats in Congress are making it difficult for our economy to really get back on its feet. Instead of rewarding people to stay home and not get a job they should pay for childcare costs for people who go to work. There are millions of jobs in this country going unfilled. Some stated reasons are fear of contracting COVID but vaccines are readily available now. If you are an antivaxer but are afraid of working a job because you fear getting the disease then the government and tax payers should not be expected to support you.,political,Facebook

"We are fast becoming a Third World totalitarian nation. Our precious birthright of freedom passed down from the founding generation is being rapidly eroded away while the odious stench of speech and thought suppression permeates the air we breathe. We no longer enjoy an unbiased and objective press and the power class reminds us daily of how we nothing more than an irredeemable racist and evil nation. American business enterprise manufacturing and innovation has been bartered away in the name of a ""one world economy"" while tens of thousands of illegal aliens amazingly still risk life and limb to reach our borders in pursuit of a better life. We have been villainized and segregated by political affiliation and fear having any rational argument with others for fear of retribution. From the corporate board to the school board we have been reduced to mindless obedient automatons driven directed rewarded and punished by the partisan masters of big money big tech big pharma and big government. We have sacrificed our liberty in the name of the hyper-security state and have stoody passively by while corrupt politicians and unelected bureaucrats have engaged in the wholesale demolition of our children's and grandchildren's legacy. The only thing more frightening than the speed with which this has taken place is the fact that we are letting it take place. Americans if you want to salvage what is left of our nation you must commit yourselves to the fight for ending the insanity. You must educate yourselves organize yourelves and be prepared to fight for saving the soul of the nation.

"My answers to Spinal Column questionnaire for special upcoming edition: What are you doing in the final days leading up to the election to reach out to voters? My overall campaign strategy changed in August when the race changed with the addition of a Democrat and the incumbent Republican losing. It was going to be a challenge already going 1 vs 1 against the incumbent . I'll continue to do social media and get my signs out.  Will you be holding any kind of socially-distanced event to speak to residents or a Zoom call to do the same? I have nothing planned but I am willing to attend any candidate debate or town hall.  What platform are you running on and is it resonating with voters? The platform that I am running on is to make Commerce Township an ""Everything is Essential Zone."" I do not believe the Lansing or DC government should be deciding what is essential in Commerce Township. We do not need a nanny state. The EEZ plan would help residents and businesses with their fiscal stability. And if the residents and businesses are in good shape the township will be in good shape too. I have not heard any complaints about the plan. Though I expect some push back from possibly the board and Lansing. As it goes against the Governor's EOs and would 'Rock the Boat"". But being a sheep is not how I am.  In these last few months of the national news media reporting on protests riots looting and police defunding what do you want Commerce residents to understand about your stance on public safety and how you will ensure that Commerce remains a safe community should you win the supervisor position? My stance on public safety is that it is an important function of government at all levels. I support the current staffing levels. I am willing to increase it as needed. When I am elected I will sit down with the commander of our contracted deputies to discuss how they are deployed and what they are prioritizing their time on. There are some who feel speed enforcement on M-5 is a good use of their time. I politely disagree. I feel they should be spending more time in our neighborhoods. Hopefully with more community interaction and encouraging ""See something Say something ""  we can find secret drug labs and houses before they blow up. Also revisiting legal marijuana dispensaries is most definitely not on my agenda as supervisor if elected.  As COVID-19 remains a part of life what can and should the township do to provide resources to help folks who are impacted by job loss as a result of the pandemic? The EEZ plan could be a good first step in helping residents. I will support continuing the efforts of our Park and rec dept. through the senior center to help our seniors with food and activities. I would make sure to inform the residents of any higher government programs available to affected residents and businesses. I would also explore the possible option of creative tax payment plans for residents and businesses  who have been hardest hit by the lockdown. The township has worked with at least one business before to achieve a win-win result.  The economy is also an important issue for voters. How is Commerce Township's economy faring and what are your plans to make it stronger? Do you have plans to entice more businesses and restaurants into the township and ultimately more jobs into the community? My plan to make the Commerce Township economy stronger and entice more businesses/restaurants is to make Commerce Township more inviting. My ""Everything is Essential Zone plan would be a good start. Keeping our taxes low is important also. The board of trustees planning commission and DDA need to take a long look at exactly what businesses/restaurants  we are willing to accept in Commerce Township. If we are too picky or fussy we could lose out on a business/restaurant that could be successful. We have some niches foodwise that are not addressed by competing commercial areas such as family style steakhouse. More Applebee ish less Bar Verona ish. If you want a fancy restaurant there are a lot in the general area.",political,Facebook
"Eliminate Time Changes Good Day Missouri!  Please call your Missouri Senate member in Jefferson City to hear and vote on this legislation to Keep Daylight Saving Time Permanent.  This legislation was voted Do Pass in the Missouri House of Representatives by a bipartisan vote of 126 Yes to 16 No. Our Missouri House Rules Administrative Oversight bipartisan committee voted it Do Pass by 11 Yes and 1 No. The Missouri House Downsizing State Government bipartisan committee voted this legislation Do Pass with a vote of 10 Yes and 1 No.  Legislation to end time change was sent to the Senate in April 2021. It is House Bill 848. I presented the third read and passed House bill at a Senate hearing in the Rules Committee. So what does the bill do?  It establishes the ""Daylight Saving as New Standard Time Pact"" consisting of this state and any other state desiring to observe permanent year round Daylight Saving Time. The bill exempts all areas of the state from the federal biannual time change provisions. In the year in which three states bordering Missouri have passed legislation entering those states into the Pact each state will switch clocks to Daylight Saving for the last time and Daylight Saving Time will be eliminated. Supporters say the bill would allow for Missourians to benefit from extra daylight in the evening. It will also promote more outdoor recreational activities boost evening economy with extended daylight and lower rates of seasonal winter time depression.  Please email me your comments of support and opposition for ending time changes. I will present the legislation again in 2022.  SanderForMissouri@gmail.com",political,Facebook

The Smith and Spera Vision for the Next Four Years (LTE to the Scotch Plains Fanwood TAP)  For the past four years Councilman Ted Spera and I Mayor Al Smith have been humbled and grateful to have served the residents of Scotch Plains. We have worked very hard to make significant progress on fiscal responsibility providing support for our police and first responders preserving our historical sites fighting against overdevelopment obtaining a AAA bond rating improving town services and increasing safety in our schools but we are far from finished. Within the next four years the Mayor and Council will face a very different set of challenges that we are prepared to meet.  The post-pandemic economy will impact our budget unlike any since the Great Recession and we must make smart and tough choices that continue our momentum of progress without further hurting the already overburdened taxpayer.  The revitalization of our downtown now becoming a reality after 35 years of false starts requires strong advocates to ensure we approve the best possible plan while not losing our current quality of life.  Next year Scotch Plains will be required to perform its town-wide property tax revaluation which will impact every home in town. Properly communicating the how and why this is being done will be critical.  And although we recently finished our latest round of court-ordered affordable housing lawsuits the next round will begin in 2024 unless our officials in Trenton step up and act to prevent it. We must be ready to assume they wont.  Councilman Spera and I will bring our leadership experience and vision to these challenges and meet them head on. Here is our five-point plan for the next four years:  1. Safely lead the township to a better normal in the post-COVID recovery. While following CDC guidelines and practicing personal responsibility one that gets us back to working in-person at town hall and the library in the schools and of course in our restaurants and businesses while continuing to expand recreational sports and town events for all. 2. Finalize and implement the exciting and sensible redevelopment of our downtown for the enrichment of residents and business owners and the stabilization of taxes. 3. Amplify the voices of traditionally underheard residents by continuing our work with the TRHT (Truth Racial Healing Transformation) Joint Committee and other new initiatives to guarantee genuine inclusiveness and the acceptance of our residents diversity in all areas of town life. 4. Fight to maintain our superior quality of life by continuing to provide and improve upon our township first responder and OEM services while preserving our history and open space. 5. Prepare and inform residents every step of the way in advance of the property tax revaluation and the next round of court-ordered affordable housing using the same transparency and honesty we provided throughout the pandemic and the redevelopment process.  As we have always done we promise to prioritize progress over politics and people over partisanship. Having served in both the majority and minority parties over the past four years we have restored civility to our public meetings and promise to continue this. Our record is one of non-partisan governance through bi-partisan collaboration and if re-elected we will continue to make decisions with the awareness that we are your neighbors first and public servants second answerable only to the best interests of the town and its residents.,political,Facebook
We all want our kids safely back in school. But parents and teachers dont want to put their children or families at risk. Until our leaders get the virus under control schools cant fully open and local businesses cant thrive. Meanwhile lack of affordable and accessible internet access makes virtual learning impossible for many of our families.  Our failure of leadership has put us in a no-win situation. Single parents and two-income households are trying to figure things out right now because its not safe for kids to be in school all day. Politicians didnt take decisive action to stop this virus and now scared parents are being forced to make terrible choices between education safety and income.  Our economy cant recover until we recover from COVID. If we can get a handle on the virus then we can rebuild the economy. But we cant separate them as much as we wish we could.  We need leaders who will follow the science and listen to the experts. We need to make sure working people can make a plan: Start a business. Pay the mortgage or rent without worry. People dont feel stable right now because they dont know what the future looks like. We have to move past that by electing better leaders and getting COVID under control so we can get our lives back get back to work and get our children safely back to school.,political,Facebook
Dear Lincoln County Resident  It seems STR Property Manager's facts need clarification. Example: STRs contribute large amounts of dollars to the Lincoln County economy.  Tourist dollars from STRs in unincorporated Lincoln County may be realized by some grocery and outlet stores but most vacationers arrive with coolers boxes and bags of food with many children.  They eat at the house walk neighborhoods access beaches and do not go to bars restaurants and tourist shops.  STRs say they contribute $11.7million in taxes however the countys 2020 budget has $1.225 from room tax. Total taxes expected from all county homes is $24m.  It is IMPOSSIBLE that 566 STR houses contribute half of the entire countys tax revenue.  Also claiming STRs contribute to county employment totaling $192 Million annually for 3600 employed. (3600 for 566 houses?) That would give a median annual wage of $53000.00 to each employee!  Housekeepers average $15/hr or $30000.00/year; a significant difference. And housekeepers report having no benefits.  Consider this fact. STR owners dont live here  Reportedly 94% of STR owners live out of the area out of state even out of the USA. The result is profits go out of the County.  Local voluntarism charity dollars and contributions such as backpack programs dont come from STR owners nor renters. Instead its local residents' support for such things.  Additionally STRs lower local census which lessens state and federal dollars coming to the County.  STRs say they support local maintenance repair commercial industries. Those houses would require the same attention but not be tax-deductible!  STR owners claim they and their renters comply with regulations. Owners are not present to witness nor manage renters' behaviors like noise garbage illegal fireworks illegal parking trespassing peeping into windows speeding cars on single-lane unincorporated residential areas stolen firewood dog poop and more.  County enforcement is through Sheriff's department with enforcement left to residential homeowners to call in complaints. Sheriff department citations are limited to criminal/civil laws needing to be witnessed with no mechanism for writing a ticket if identified.  Owners say there are no reported problems however county reporting and enforcement are not sufficient for the 566 homes from Yachts to Lincoln City!  Recent witnessing of vacationers wearing their guns while walking residential neighborhoods questions why are STRs good for Unincorporated Residential Lincoln County. Does an incident have to happen before action is done?  How do authorities prepare for the next emergency when an additional 140 people per 600 feet are vacationing in these small neighborhoods?  Where could vacationers go? Hotels motels resorts or zoned tourist housing zones with appropriate emergency preparedness and onsite management.  Want a voice in this matter?

My Response to questions answered by my opponent in an article today:  Your full name: Richard A. Foss Jr. Age: 47 Occupation: Network Systems Analyst Residence: Waterville ME Party: Republican Education: Graduate Winslow High School 1991 Aviation Electrician  US Navy Certified Fiber Optics Technician  Electronics Technicians Association State Certified Motorcycle Safety Instructor Experience: Current Waterville Ward 5 City Councilor Waterville Fire Committee Asst Director American Legion Riders Post 51 Motorcycle Safety Instructor and Site Coordinator  3 Years Telecomm Installation Repair and Training Specialist  18 Years Dad and Husband.  Questions: 1. Why are you running? a. I believe Augusta isnt working for us any longer. Were being driven down a road of socialistic ideology and thats not the Maine Way. We are hard workers and deserve representation that truly delivers in our values. Covid has devastated our economy and physiology. We need a Representative willing to stand up for us and not just vote the party line or not at all on the tough subjects. 2. What are your top legislative priorities? a. To advance job creating initiatives that help not hurt those that want to do better for themselves. Giving a pathway to prosperity while cutting spending to lower the taxes for all of us. I believe that when you grow the taxable base through job growth were able to lower the taxes for all. All while introducing legislation as a veteran to help our returning veteranss attain the education and business ownership opportunities the so dearly deserve. Couple that with tax cuts and spending cuts and well be poised to retain the youth of our great state and have a better path forward. 3. What will you do specifically to address those priorities? a. My approach will be to submit for consideration 5 bills that will grow the renewable energy portfolio help those who protect us give a pathway out of welfare that works and protect our farmers that are being pushed out of the local economy by special interests. I will also work to end needless spending on items recently enacted while protecting the lives that dont have a voice. I will rise and stand against legislation that strips our rights away as Americans while protecting citizen only voting and defending our police and first responders. 4. Are there any other regional or state issues that concern you? a. Our communities will suffer from the overspending happening at the State level. Ill work to secure profit sharing while cutting the projects that drive up our taxes. Ill stand against any measure that would impose new addition heating oil or gasoline taxes that would devastate our citizens and further complicate the recovery from the COVID crisis.,political,Facebook

"CORPORATE RESPONSIBILTY TO THE PUBLIC GOOD My philosophy as a lifelong Green Independent is that impeccable environmental stewardship is directly connected to the strength of our economy and health of our people. Our government should reflect the will of the people and design policies of economic growth that realizes private profit as a means to contribute toward the public good through fair taxation. When wealthy multinational corporations refuse to pay their fair share toward the common good through equitable taxation and when politicians enable those corporations to avoid fair taxation at the deprivation of public interest our economic and governmental structures fail us. The public can not afford any longer to clean up the environmental messes of industry. Any industry that cannot profit without damaging the environment -- that cannot incorporate environmental integrity into the true costs of doing their business -- is an industry that needs to adapt to keep up with the demands of today's world or close their books and start anew. A business model that requires harm to the environment or people is a failed model. Corporations are not private organizations entitled to the rights to do as they please -- they are granted their existences through public charters. When the public trust is broken a corporation's ""right"" to exist must always be questioned. If we can address climate change and land conservation head-on we can realize economic growth through jobs creation reduced energy costs and environmental tourism. Corporations must realize their duty to join us in this effort instead of fighting against a public interest.",political,Facebook
A person in my life said that the Coronavirus debacle was a just a S*** Sandwich and that Trump is just Doing the Best That He Can.  What I couldnt say at the time and thought better to not agitate him was this:  Given the evidence that the ENTIRE PLANET was infected with this virus and that nearly every developed nation that used reasonable measures in prevention by following the advice of professionals in the field have lower infection rates per capita and lower overall fatality rates. Despite having a first world medical industry and top rated immunology research facilities I have to sternly object to the idea that Trump was just doing the Best that he can and implying that this would have happened regardless of who was in office.  First his ban on China was at best an amateurish attempt to prevent the virus from coming into the country not thinking about the 40000 people that were in China and that are residents of the United States would immediately come home to all points of the country in a panic. Plus his attempt to ban travel from Europe but NOT the UK. That managed to allow the virus to seep in from the Atlantic side.  Next no national testing contact tracing quarantine or masking protocol was put in place though these protocols were left in a pandemic playbook for future administrations by the Obama Administration. Trump arrogantly decided that he knew better than Obama on these matters despite Obamas record of response that was clearly superior to Trumps in nearly every way with the three epidemics during his eight years in office.  Finally Trump falsely claimed that the National stockpile was bare that there was no Playbook that it would just Go Away and that No One Could Have Known but these claims have been fact checked by multiple sources and found to be False Mostly False or Pants On Fire. Additionally Bob Woodward Pulitzer prize winning journalist has it on tape proving that he lied to the country about knowing how severe the virus is how lethal it is how communicable it is and how it is transmitted from one person to another. He literally knew all of these factors and delayed the national public response by Playing it Down in deference to our economy in a narcissistic endeavor to assure his reelection.  So what has Trump done exactly in terms of the Coronavirus that was so wrong?  Considering that he lies nearly every word that comes out of his mouth he is flagrantly incompetent and reckless with his public speaking when matters of national interest are involved. His obsession with showing the world that he is a better President than his predecessor has demonstrably shown that he is anything but. His complete disregard for Plans and Procedures that have been endorsed by experts in the field in favor of just going By His Gut has turned a small panic into a nationwide catastrophe where the United States having only 4% of the worlds population has 25% of the worlds fatalities directly due to Covid-19. His decision process has shown to be short sighted impulsive and disregarding of scientific reality.  No Trump is not doing the Best That He Can. He isnt even trying.,political,Facebook
I'm jumping the gun on the publication of the Chisago County Press Candidate Q&A but I found one question particularly thought-provoking. We candidates are consistently asked what one thing is holding our community back and what we would do about it. It's important that our local officials recognize there is always room for improvement and that we have ideas in place to address these issues.  I believe one thing holding our community back would be our sluggish growth in economic development and something that does not get nearly enough attention our lack of affordable housing. If elected I will work to make economic development a main priority for our city so we can grow our tax base to avoid raising taxes on our current residents and I want to do this in a responsible manner to foster our small town feel that we all love about our community. It is very well known that Minnesota is facing an affordable housing crisis and labor studies over the past few years by the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development have confirmed this crisis is impacting Chisago County. Ive personally heard how many people who come to work for our employers in Wyoming are unable to afford to live in our town. Those of us on the Wyoming Economic Development Authority have been working hard with developers to attract these projects. I want to continue to seek these projects and work to attract and give these potential residents who want to live in our fine city the opportunity to do so which will translate into a greater tax base more dollars being spent at our local businesses and within our local economy and an overall thriving community and city.,political,Facebook

I'm John Plante running for State Representative District 4.  First and foremost Im not a politician. I am approaching this race like its a multi-panel job interview. Im a programmer by trade  I am a lead of other leads and have been in the IT industry for over 20 years. Ive had the opportunity to work in and support multiple industries in companies and organizations ranging from startups to a 278-acre government research facility to multi-national corporations. I have a Masters in Homeland Security a Bachelors of English a minor in Education and additional training in leadership corporate strategy/product development disaster recovery/preparation policy and communication.  More-so than a programmer though I consider myself a family man and community member. Both my wife and I are former foster parents fostering four-children adopting two of them bringing our total number of children to four. The two we adopted were born drug-addicted and have special needs due to this and family history. My wife and I have been community volunteers for over 20 years now  she currently is a VP at two local non-profits and I do publicity for one of them as well. We put our skills to helping provide stability for people and their families so I have an understanding of how families fall vulnerable and how we can add stability to our communities.  I think my fusion of life experiences corporate/government experience education and training make me a strong candidate for Okaloosa. It sets me apart from many other candidates who have had less breadth of experiences than mine. Im comfortable in a range of business environments  as a former foster parent and current community support volunteer I understand a lot of the issues people face day to day and my Masters will help plan and prepare for our existing emergencies as well as our future.  I'll be honest - next year's state budget is not expected to be strong. I will prioritize items to stabilize our economy by leaning into stimulus for small business leaning into infrastructure projects to put people back to work while businesses recover increase access to healthcare mental health services boost educational opportunity for all and promote unity in our region.,political,Facebook
"AN AMERICAN NATIONALIST VOTING INDEX Draining the Swamp  ""Behind the ostensible government sits enthroned an invisible government owing no allegiance and acknowledging no responsibility to the people. To destroy this invisible government to befoul the unholy alliance between corrupt business and corrupt politics is the first task of the statesmanship of the day."" Theodore Roosevelt  This is a part of a series examining the issues in the presidential election. To see other articles in the series visit the website below and click on the 2020 Elections link on the Home page.  Score  Biden 0 Trump -1  Trumps victory in 2016 was powered by a call to drain the swamp in Washington which never consisted simply of campaign reform. It sought to end the kind of cancer described by Roosevelt  the control of government by a privileged few that subverts the very nature of democracy itself. We also now know it means different things to different groups. In this campaign the call for reform has focused on not just campaign reform but also on federal administrative and policing changes.  Campaign Finance Reform  The Citizens United decision and our loophole-riddle campaign finance laws have loosed a flood of money whose origins are opaque and very probably illegal. Democrats introduced a bill that would plug some of those loopholes. It attempts to limit the impact of Citizens United by requiring disclosure of donations of more than $10000 from certain non-profits that were previously exempt. It cracks down on digital ad spending on social media platforms by requiring the same kind of disclosure of the source of ads required for television and radio commercials. The bill also attempts to limit the use of social media for the kind of election interference we saw from the Russians in 2016 by banning campaign contributions from corporations with significant foreign ownership. Finally it also prevents foreign individuals from purchasing social media ads. Former Vice President Biden has endorsed these proposals and President Trump opposes them. This earns Biden a +1 and Trump a -1.  However there is a sleeper issue in campaign finance that has been ignored by both candidates. If you are like me your e-mail box has been deluged by appeals for campaign contributions from any number of candidates and partisan political action committees. They seek contributions of as little as five dollars by simple completion of a form on the Internet and a charge via PayPal or by credit card. While the identity of the donors must be disclosed there are no rules requiring the verification of their identities. A former Kansas attorney general recently issued an analysis of the contributions to the ActBlue independent committees which raised over $900 million for Democratic candidates. It showed how ActBlue has gamed the campaign finance system so that the true sources of their contributions is almost impossible to determine. This makes it easy for large donors to break up their contributions or foreign donors to hide theirs If Biden or President Trump are really interested in controlling dark money this loophole must be plugged as well.  Federal Administrative Law Reform  The failure of Congress to address a pressing issue has now become an excuse for forcing action through administrative rulemakings. As I mentioned in my post on the US Supreme Courts s opinion on the DACA rulemaking current law makes it difficult to control an executive agencys impulse to fill this perceived gap. This essentially creates a fourth branch of government whose inner workings are known and accessible to only a few.  Federal executive power needs to be reined in through new legislation that (1) Limits agency rulemaking to discrete subjects narrowly delegated to the agency; (2) Prohibit agency action if its impact on the economy or the number of people affected exceeds certain thresholds; (3) Allows more opportunity to challenge a agency ruling and repeal it. The DACA and Clean Power Plan rules of the Obama Administration show that Vice President Biden is a likely opponent of such reforms. Meanwhile Trump has relied on and touted his executive order power instead of pursuing legislation to prevent a future president from abusing these powers. President Bidens implied approval of current agency power results in a -1 for him on this issue while Trump deserves only a 0.  Law Enforcement Reform  The death of George Floyd and other African-Americans at the hands of the police and the FBI abuses of the FISA warrant system revealed in the Russia investigation has highlighted another swamp that needs to be drained  the excessive and unchecked power of law enforcement. As mentioned in this post policing reforms must be based not only reducing qualified immunity and other changes in tactics but also a top-to-bottom review of our law enforcement strategy.  Former Vice President Biden supports proposals to reform police tactics but never mentions the need for increased funding for the police necessary to do their job of maintaining order in our communities. The Obama Administrations acquiescence at the least and encouragement at worst of the FBIs FISA abuses does not inspire any confidence that he would support reform in this area. These two positions cancel each other out and earn him a zero on this subject. While the Trump Administration is vigorously pursuing the FBI abuses via the John Durham investigation the President has ignored and at times demagogued the police brutality issue Again the two positions cancel each other out and thus he also deserves only a zero  Conclusion  It is truly discouraging that neither candidate has Roosevelts level of concern about the perilous state of American democracy and civil rights. Trumps failures are particularly galling since his 2016 campaign featured the issue. It is up to American nationalists to press these issues with congressional candidates and in future elections.

WHAT IS NEOLIBERALISM & HOW ARE THE MIND TRUST AND STAND FOR CHILDREN PART OF THE NATIONAL NEOLIBERAL MOVEMENT?  Neoliberalism is NOT what the word seems to imply. Neoliberalism is much closer to conservative or even rightwing than it is to what we commonly think liberalism means. The label emerged out of the early 1900s with a group of European theorists at a time when labeling it neoliberalism was somewhat relevant in that historical context. However the word has now culturally solidified so there is little chance of changing it. The easiest translation is that when you see the word neoliberalism think conservative to rightwing.  The most straightforward way to understand neoliberalism today is to learn what neoliberals commonly support in terms of governmental policies. While most folks studying neoliberalism may not agree with all of these characteristics most folks would mostly agree and with a little study all are easy to document:  ***Commitment to individuals is more important than communities; private good is better than public good  ***Lower taxes on the wealthy  ***Decrease funding for social programs like health care and even Medicare Medicaid and social security  ***Decrease funding for public schooling along with privatizing schooling through charters and vouchers so as they explicitly say (i.e. Milton Friedman) money can be made off of public schooling  ***Get rid of unions especially teachers unions ***Decrease the voting of folks of color students and low-income people in general by making it more difficult for them to vote  **Decrease democracy in general mainly by privatizing all government services even the military and police ***Ending any regulations that impair the freedom of the wealthy to pursue ever more wealth  ***Oppose climate change policies as they may impair the freedom of the wealthy to pursue more wealth  ***Support for the fossil-based economy while ignoring the environmental damages caused by it  In addition while they consciously hide their racism research on the national neoliberal movement shows they are explicitly racist. Research also shows that this movement is driven by conservative-to-rightwing billionaires (such as Koch Brothers DeVos family Mitchel family) their organizations (like CREDO) and their millions of dollars in contributions. You can read the highly respected research on this in MacLeans Democracy in Chains Mayers Dark Money and books by Randolph Hohle.  Also you can get information on the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) where essentially all of state-level neoliberal legislation comes from which includes Indianas laws on charters vouchers and innovation schools. Indeed the Indiana legislature tends to pass many laws developed by ALEC.  Unfortunately many folks involved with neoliberal organizations do not know what is behind these organizations especially in terms of national funding and agendas. For example many people who work for Stand for Children or Mind Trust may not know whats behind their organizations. Many of these folks may not know they are part of a national neoliberal movement in education to privatize public schooling.  There are organizations just like the Mind Trust and Stand for Children in multiple major U.S. cities because the cities are seen as more vulnerable to anti-democratic manipulation through the use of millions of dollars. An obvious example of this in Indianapolis is that Stand for Children headquartered in Oregon has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on electing IPS school board members (OConnor Hawkins Arnold Moore) who then follow the neoliberal agenda.  While it is regrettable that Lilly the Chamber and MIBOR have bought into this national neoliberal agenda all Indianapolis citizens need to know that IPS is being indirectly controlled by conservative-to-rightwing white billionaires largely from outside Indiana through their contributions of millions of dollars to Stand for Children and the Mind Trust. Even more so individuals working for these organizations need to know who's really controlling their agenda and whos funding their organizations.

  ' - Recently I posted a video about the Wisconsin Rapids Verso Mill closure and Assembly Bill 199 the Papermaker Fund Bill which did not receive a hearing the past two legislative sessions. This video apparently struck a nerve with current Representative Scott Krug. Instead of providing a plan and explaining what he has done to help grow our economy and save our local good-paying jobs my opponent decided to go to the airwaves of social media throwing insults declaring me childish and nave twisting my words and promoting false information.  This is exactly the kind of politics people are sick and tired of. I believe in working together to find real solutions and I believe that we should respectfully call out bad behavior no matter what party you belong to. Nowhere in my video did I state this bill would magically fix or save our local Verso paper mill. I very clearly stated Assembly Bill 199 was meant to assist mills in converting their papermaking processes to one of higher demand. This   would be an expensive and lengthy endeavor. Yet it is already being done in mills across our state in an attempt to meet the new demands of the paper industry as some move away from lines of production that are no longer sought after products.  Right here in a 72nd Assembly District Nine Dragons paper mill in Biron is finishing the conversion of one of its paper machines from a white paper product to a containerboard product spending the funds necessary to ensure production and jobs continue into the future.  Wisconsin is home to approximately 34 paper mills producing a variety of paper products the mill industry itself employs over 30000 workers. The industry is an anchor for Wisconsins economy by forming partnerships with the trucking industry pulping industry and numerous other direct and indirect services. The most recent information declares our paper mills and combined partnerships are a $28.8 billion dollar industry for our state.  No Representative Krug I am not naive. In fact I have a solid understanding of the paper industry and the vast variety of products they produce in this state. We need representatives in Madison working together across party lines in a respectful and civil manner to ensure this crucial industry stays viable and productive long into the future.  At the end of the day there was a bill that could have provided assistance and funding to the paper industry to help mills evolve and adapt to our changing economy. You called it a bad bill what efforts did you put forth to work across party lines to make it better?  I plan to hold elected officials accountable and if elected I want the voters to hold me accountable too. Rest assured Representative Krug I will always strive to have my communications to (and about) you portrayed in a civil and respectful manner. Feel free to proceed with the name-calling if that is what you feel is going to be successful for you I have very thick skin.,political,Facebook
"LIBERTARIANISM  The discovery most shocking to me since the start of this Page has been the size of the libertarian movement in this nation. As a member of the far left I see the potential for good within government. Libertarians do not see this and generally believe in only enough government necessary to secure order and property rights. Government from a democratic point of view should be the voice of the people libertarians see government as the tyranny of the majority against the minority.  My personal view along with many others on the left is that government contrary to our democratic aspirations is largely under the control of the wealthy elite. This overweight of power exercised by the wealthy elite I had always assumed would be anathema to the broad mass of Americans which are not members of the wealthy elite. Within the libertarian movement however this is not the case. The libertarian movement is an effort to restrain democratic forces. While libertarians want freedom in all areas of life they are particularly protective of property rights. Democratic efforts to spread the wealth are resisted by the libertarian minded who fail to recognize or have little regard for the reality that it is the system of people which enables wealth accumulation. All people from across the classes have participated in wealth creation even the unemployed participate as they exert downward pressure on wages which benefits the private commercial sector at least in the short run.  It is difficult to grapple with the idea that people obtain wealth or property based solely on their own merit and based on this belief are then entitled to an outsized portion of the national product. An individual living alone on a desert island regardless of effort would never accumulate much more than a hut and a stack of wood. It is the community through historical institutional development physical asset development along with current work efforts which builds wealth.  The lower and middle classes simply want a livable share of the national product something given market based pricing which can only be achieved through the democratic process. In order to prevent this libertarians try to thwart the democratic will not necessarily in a mean spirited fashion but simply through a failure to recognize the system's vital role in the creation of wealth.  Market valuations vital to the libertarian free market model should be qualified to recognize the failure of the market value model to appropriately price labor goods and services. Market value does not adequately value the potential of a human life nor does the final price of a good or service account for the full cost of production. Much cost of production is socialized: this includes pollution created during the production process community disinvestment inherent to the dynamic capitalist model and the moral cost associated with an economic model which elevates the love of consumption over the love of fellow human beings.  The basic libertarian creed is that people ought to be free to do as they please so long as they impose no harm on others. Few people on the left or the right would disagree with this notion. We all want to be free. Within libertarianism however there seems to be a failure to recognize when one person's freedom imposes harm or a loss of freedom on others. One person's freedom often represents another's oppression.  When corporate executives freely decide to disinvest in urban and rural communities harm in the form of blight decreased property values decreased employment decreased wages and increased criminality are imposed on those left behind. Freedom for capital to flow elsewhere has imposed harm and a loss of freedom on others. This reflects the tyranny of the minority--private commercial ownership interests--against the majority.  One person's libertarian inspired maskless appearance at social or public gatherings during the pandemic enabled the additional spread of the virus and imposed death on some people caught-up in the additional spread. The insistence on the freedom to appear maskless imposed a loss of freedom on others to live.  When Elon Musk opened his California Tesla manufacturing facility in violation of democratically elected County officials' mandate to do otherwise this anti-democratic move was applauded by many libertarians. Not only did Musk overthrow the democratic will he also put his worker's lives at risk for what is arguably nonessential production. He elevated his personal vision above that of his employees and the democratic vision expressed through the state. His personal freedom created harm to others.  At this point in the argument libertarians in a somewhat diversionary fashion often resort to the argument that we live in a republic not a democracy which will be considered but does not provide moral justification for individual behavior which does harm to others. Experts seem to agree that we live in something perhaps adequately described as a democratic republic somewhere between republican and democratic forms of government. This seems fair. Our representative democracy or democratic republicanism is less democratic than more direct forms of democracy and was explicitly designed to achieve a more stable society with an eye towards preservation of the status quo while providing influence to the broader public. Preservation of the status quo is another way to express preservation of property rights.  This form of governance elevates property rights over the welfare of the bottom third or so who struggle mightily in the economic realm. Some might be tempted at this point to argue that anyone can prosper in a free market system. This reasoning simply defies all historical evidence which points to the conclusion that poverty and hardship at one end of the economic spectrum is necessary in order to provide price stability which is necessary in a monetary economy and which enables prosperity at the other end of the economic spectrum. In other words some people are relegated to low wage or no-wage conditions in order to prevent inflationary pressures--a prerequisite to a stable free market economy. This preserves property values and demonstrates the elevation of property rights over the welfare of those within the bottom third or so who struggle within the economic realm.  Somehow because the Bill of Rights provides for great individual freedom and due to its stature apparently equal to that of holy scripture it follows that people must always and everywhere exercise this freedom. Which is kind-of like saying that because a car can travel at 150 mph then the car should be driven at that speed through a residential neighborhood. Because you can do something does not mean that you should do it or that you should be legally able to do so. There is within the republican form of governance nothing which prevents the creation of structures which enhance greater democratic control. One need not insist on less bridled behavior simply because one lives under a modified republican form.  For those who economically struggle within our Nation democratic guidance of economic forces is the path towards freedom. Without democratic restraint of large private sector powers we would live under private sector corporate tyranny which would consist of kingly CEO's and knighted management with private armies which charge tolls as we travel across corporate borders. This private government governing structure would lack wage labor and other protections.  While this would represent liberty for the few the vast majority of us would be subject to the will of the private powerful few. Elected government is the only mechanism through which the people can restrain private sector power. Although government is currently captured by this private power this is no argument to eliminate government but is rather an argument for the capture of government by the people to enable their freedom.  We have been conditioned in this Nation to think of ourselves as a democracy. We seldom hear U.S. politicians refer to our American Republic but rather they incessantly refer to our American democracy. Perhaps this provides cover for the system. Perhaps from their perspective atop the hierarchy the system seems democratic as those with capital or with the support of capital seem to freely participate in the governing of the Nation. For those of us within the base of the hierarchy without capital it all seems rather undemocratic as capital has an outsized voice in the management of the system. So here I agree with the libertarians we live in a republic less so a democracy although it is still far too democratic for many libertarians and not democratic enough from my own point of view.  The problem is not the libertarian creed that we should be free to do as we please so long as we do no harm to others assuredly most of us can agree on this basic principle. The problem lies in the failure to recognize when one person's freedom imposes on another's freedom. Without democratic restraint the asset owning minority will tyrannize the majority and we will be left in a world where ""might makes right"" democracy fades and we will move towards a private sector authoritarian model with little democratic restraint--perhaps we are closer to this state of being than we currently recognize.

Some people may be concerned Im a single issue candidate but thats not correct. The truth of the matter is I have many issues of concern which have been at the forefront of my campaign.  I strongly support funding our infrastructure and core services FIRST. In order to maintain our roads at 70% efficiency they need to be funded at $3.5 million per year. In the past decade we have been under funding our roads by approximately $1 million per year leaving them in subpar condition. Proper funding leads to less significant issues in the future.  The Woody Seat freeway is another example of the problems created by underfunding our bridges. The city is now applying for government money to help with necessary repairs needed to the bridge at Avenue A and Adams. The approved plans attached to the government money will change how traffic flows into Hutchinson from South Hutchinson. The plans will also cut off Avenue B which is a highly traveled road used daily by residents in the south west part of town. If Hutchinson is not awarded the government money our cost to repair the bridge will increase from approximately $2 million to an estimated $9 million.  Our sewer and water maintenance items have also been neglected and underfunded leaving our community in a crisis situation. This crisis created the implementation of the stormwater utility fees which has negatively impacted Hutchinson. In 2015 the city collected approximately $600000 from the community for sewer/water maintenance. After implementing the stormwater utility fee program in 2016 our community paid in almost $2.2 million. This cost has proven too great as we lost established businesses and drove away future opportunities. This program must be restructured.  While the proper funding of infrastructure is one of my main goals Im also in favor of promoting new business to create new revenue and to make sure our first responders have the resources needed to work safely and effectively.  As Ive always said a stronger economy creates a stronger community. I hope I can count on your vote on November 2nd #togetherwegrow,political,Facebook
Having just watched the virtual COO Breakfast it could not be clearer how important the vitality of our local ski industry is to the health of the entire Summit County economy. It has been a long time since we had a commissioner with recent relevant experience in the ski industry.  The county commission is a three-person council. We must work together with our local ski area COOs to ensure Summit County stays open for business to keep people working and to keep new Coronavirus cases low.  It is likely the new group of county commissioners will have to make some very difficult choices to balance the holistic public health safety economic and societal consequences of any further Coronavirus orders.  It is critical to have elected officials who have real experience weighing difficult decisions and making tough choices with the best interests of the community in mind.  I am the one candidate in District 3 with this type of leadership experience.  Vote Bruce Butler for District 3 Summit County Commissioner.,political,Facebook
The geographical divide pitting the blue ocean coasts against the red interior is partly culture to be sure. Social liberals are heavily concentrated on the coasts while social conservatives especially White Evangelical Protestants are heavily concentrated in the South and Midwest. Yet the blue-red divide has a crucial socioeconomic dimension as well.  Though Democrats had been considered the party of the working class since the New Deal they carried the richest counties and lost in many of the poorest in 2016. Understanding that fact is key not only for the Democrats to retake the White House but for the country as a whole to reunite in a common purpose. As candidate Joe Biden seems to be conveying the right messages.  Democrats have become the party of social progressives African Americans and other minorities environmentalists and younger voters as well as the party of those with bachelor's degrees or higher. Republicans meanwhile became the party of social conservatives especially Evangelicals and increasingly of White working-class and older voters.  Rapid technological changes have pulled blue and red states apart economically notably most advanced in the blue states. Democratic Party strongholds on the two coasts are heavily oriented towards the high-tech service sectors while staunch Republican Party regions in the interior are heavily concentrated in the goods sectors such as manufacturing and fossil fuels.  The economies driving blue states are based heavily on professional sectors that draw on a workforce with bachelor's degrees or higher. Meanwhile the goods-producing sectors of red states including agriculture and forestry mining construction and manufacturing and draw on a workforce with much lower rates of college completion.  When comparing election outcomes to data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis Clinton carried 17 of the 20 states with relatively large service sectors while Trump carried 27 of the 30 states with relatively large goods sectors. The 15 states with the highest proportion of employment in mining logging construction and manufacturing all went for Trump while 9 of the 10 states with the lowest proportion of workers in goods-producing sectors went for Clinton. Clinton carried the states with high-tech services. All 15 states with the highest proportion of adults with advanced degrees (post-Bachelor's) went for Clinton while 24 of the 25 states with the lowest proportion of advanced degrees went for Trump.  Thirteen of the 15 richest states (ranked by median household income) voted for Clinton while 22 of the poorest 25 states voted for Trump. These high incomes reflect the earnings of the high-tech professional sectors.  Voters in red states that both produce and use fossil fuels more heavily have been wary of plans to decarbonize the economy. In 1979 employment in manufacturing peaked at 19 million jobs but declined to around 12 million by the time of the 2016 election. By 2016 many industrial workers felt that the Democrats were no longer representing their interests.  Trump swooped in on these states during his first campaign to wrest many of them from Democrats charging them with ignoring their job plight. He claimed that the jobs had been lost to China Mexico and immigrants and that he would restore the jobs through protectionism and anti-immigrant policies. These arguments were grossly exaggerated and ignored the forces of automation which has led to an increase in output of goods despite fewer workers thanks to robotics and other technological advances.  He prevailed with an aggressive though utterly false and blatantly racist narrative. He told red-state voters that China and Mexico had stolen their jobs and that he would return them. He blamed immigrants for many of the red-state ills. He promised to resurrect the red-states' fossil-fuel industries.  In fact Trump's remedies have been so much hocus-pocus. The number of those employed in manufacturing in 2019 remained well below 2008 numbers. The number of manufacturing jobs in August 2020 was 247000 less than at the start of his term in January 2017. He did not and could not bring jobs back from China since most of the job decline in industry reflected automation not trade and since even jobs squeezed out of China by US tariffs will simply shift jobs to Vietnam or other low-income but highly productive countries.  Moreover Trump has not and could not resurrect the coal oil and gas industries. His promises to do so are recklessly blind to the world's shift away from fossil fuels and towards green energy due both to the climate crisis and also to falling costs of renewables. Jobs in mining and oil and gas extraction are down by 30000 since Trump took office and will fall further as America's declining and money-losing fossil-fuel production is replaced by wind and solar power. The S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production stock index is down 51.5% over the past year while the Clean Energy S&P is up 50.7% over the same period.  He did not and could not create decent red-state jobs by clamping down on immigration since immigrants were never the cause of red-state job woes to begin with.  He also promised a boom in construction jobs building new infrastructure across the US but he failed to do so as he lacked any serious vision of what the country needs.  Democrats now have the opportunity to reunite the nation by creating jobs across all regions. They should offer an industrial plan to build the next generation of electric vehicles smart grids advanced batteries and green fuels (such as hydrogen produced with renewable energy) -- all of which would create new jobs throughout the industrial heartland.  The Democrats can win over the natural-resource states by playing to their great strengths: massive low-cost renewable energy (especially wind and solar power) and new mining resources for advanced batteries electric vehicles wind turbines and other parts of the new industrial economy.  The Democrats should also lead on the long-delayed modernization of infrastructure: interstate transmission lines to carry renewable energy; buildings retrofitted for electrification and energy efficiency; charging stations and other facilities for electric vehicles; transmission pipelines for hydrogen and other green fuels; and a 5G network for advanced digital services. -Jeffrey D Sachs,political,Facebook
Ive studied the signs of the times and believe were approaching a global cataclysmone predicted in our Scriptures and unfolding before our eyes.

I realized they are not isolated movements philosophies or events. They are as interconnected as a spiders web....  Emerging globalism. Our worldwide economy hanging by a strand.

"As promised and as asked by so many of you I have been in contact multiple times with our county commissioners they oversee the health department. I encourage you to contact the commissioners as well. When emailing them they asked we use this email address as it goes to all of them as well as the county management: BOCC-Commissioners@jocogov.org  Here is my most recent communication below. I am your voice as elected and asked but I can not effect change alone.  Good morning Commissioners and County Management I am a Spring Hill School District School Board member. I do not speak for my school district but rather for the hundreds of parents teachers staff community members I represent who have asked me to use my voice. They are terrified of COVID-19 not necessarily of the virus but the effect of the decision making around the virus.  We need your help I need your help. The issue is: the current gating criteria to repoen schools. We need a gating criteria but the current gating criteria isnt appropriate. It only uses 1 data point. A data point that is impossible. We havent been under 5% positive since June 17th in the county. 5% is when we can be fully open and all children in school. It will be near impossible to ever be under 5% only looking at testing an average of 1.6% of the entire county. The current gating criteria is misleading. We are not at an average of 10% of the county testing positive we are at an average of 10% of the 1.6% tested.  With the current criteria many will soon be faced with a decision to leave children at home alone trying to do online education OR lose their jobs or income staying home with them. This will drastically affect businesses in loss of employees as well as patronage. When this gating criteria reaches 15% positive and thats not far off they will recommend business shut down as well.  In addition to potential job loss and therefore house loss is the many detrimental consequences to the community if schools are not being open. Mental health issues in children AND adults on the severe rise food insecurity through the roof abuse cases astronomical. Many claim this shouldnt be a school issue saying its a community issue but this isnt the time to solve that in the middle of it.  We need to demand better gating criteria.  We need our county commissioners to help to speak up to the health department hold them accountable and ask them to do better. When the health department was contacted they said this was a ""guess"" at the best criteria and it could be changed. I realize this is a new virus there is no playbook but we can not ""guess"" with the lives of our constituents. The districts can vote to follow this or not follow this but we need the guidance of what to follow. The health department has passed the buck inappropriately.  I have full confidence that you will be our voice and speak up to the detriments and ripple effect across the county. Help us hold the county health department accountable. Help us to get our children back in school safely. Help protect our businesses and economy.  I alone voted against this current gating criteria in my district. We need an appropriate gating criteria a guideline from the health experts. This is not it. I can not stand by and be a willing participant and watch the lives of our district families be drastically impacted based on 1.6% of the county. I can not wait and see what the health departments best ""guess"" is. I hope you will not as well.  I need your help. Our county needs your help.  Thank you Ali Seeling",political,Facebook
"Every candidate running for office in Brewster promises that they will implement the Town's 2018 Vision Plan work with citizens listen to concerns and work to solve complex issues.  One candidate has actually done it. When Brewster had no bylaws or regulations to protect our wetlands I wrote them. I worked with colleagues neighbors and the Conservation Commission and and got them passed by Town Meeting. When MassDOT wanted to turn Route 6A into a four lane highway between Underpass Rd and Nickerson State Park I created a task force of Town officials the Secretary of Transportation the Secretary of Environmental Affairs and Energy and stopped it. When the Recreation Commission expressed concerns that no Town land was being devoted to sports fields I worked with them and we built the Freemans Way fields. My wife and I owned a small business on Route 6A in Brewster and we know the challenges of operating in a seasonal economy.  I have spent my entire career all of it on Cape Cod working with citizens municipal boards and businesses to protect the Cape's water supplies wetlands open spaces and Brewster's community character.

Why run for City Council?  1. Paraphrasing John Stuart Mill Let not any one pacify his conscience by the delusion that he can do no harm if he takes no part and forms no opinion. Evil need nothing more to compass their ends than that good men should look on and do nothing. My answer is I have to step up and be the man that at least tries to make the difference. Honesty is a characteristic that an elected official must have. They must show integrity in their actions and be intellectually honest with their approach to issues.  2. Balanced: I will be a representative of ALL THE PEOPLE not for any special interest group or be pressured and/or swayed by others. My views will be a balanced look at what is needed for a stronger local economy support for a viable plan for a better city infrastructure and ensuring safety for all residents.  3. Committed: I have always been dedicated and gone above and beyond to any position or job assigned. As a member of District 1 City Council I will dedicate the time energy and effort for all. I will make myself available for everyone and anyone to listen answer questions and hear concerns and ideas. I have already started reading voluminous amounts of materials to better understand what is happening in Washington.  4. Motivated: My ONLY MOTIVATION is to serve the citizens of District 1 and Washington GA. I do not have AN AGENDA or a special interest group trying to get me elected. I will be a city council person that works for the interests of the community and nothing else.  5. Experience: My life has provided me the needed experience to lead. Whether it be in combat as a United States Soldier or around a boardroom table. I have been in corporate offices discussing budgets and working on multimillion dollar projects. I feel as though my life experiences have certainly enhanced my ability to lead.  6. Electable: I feel my personal values traits and qualifications make me a great candidate for city council. I know there are no issues with my past that would make you stop and think I am not an electable candidate.  In a little over one month we will be going to the polls to vote for 2 two District 1 City Council positions. All I ask is that you think about those who have served and what they have or have not done for you as a citizen of District 1 and for the City of Washington.

A politician thinks of the next election; a statesman thinks of the next generation. James Freeman Clarke  Id appreciate your vote on November 3rd. Itd be an honor to represent you the people of Kimball. This election is a very important one in regard to the future of our city. It is critical that we become forward thinking about the next 5 10 15+ years. Where do we want to be? How are we going to get there? What steps do we need to take? What is our plan A? Plan B? Plan C? Strategic planning and implementation are vital to the future of the place we call home Kimball. This election isnt about me its about you. Its about your future your familys future its about making life better in Kimball. Its about the next generation making Kimball a better place than it is now for them. Its about coming together to build a sense of pride that is missing. Its about getting ready for the missile project and touting our small businesses and touting their exceptional abilities and offerings. Marketing all that we have to offer Northrop Grumman Bechtel and any other subcontractors. We need to get ready for the economic boom we will experience. We need to roll out the welcome mat and make them feel at home. We owe to each and every one of you citizens of Kimball to do the best job possible to get things ready for the project. This missile project will bring an economic boost to Main Street and to Kimball one that we havent experienced in decades. Our businesses desperately need it 2020 has been hard on our local economy. We can not afford to downplay the project. To downplay the project would be a disservice to the citizens of Kimball. We owe it to our small business owners to make Kimball an easy place to do business and set our small businesses up for success both now during the missile project and beyond that. I will go to bat for Kimball the town that I love and its wonderful people. Once again I ask for your vote on November 3rd. I promise together we will make Kimball a place your proud to call home!

I see today in the media that Americans are increasingly aware that the destruction the virus has wrought in the United States could have been mostly avoided so I am reposting this (updated) in the hopes that even more people will become aware of this fact. Please share this widely. Thank you.  After months of paperwork to get the Lone Liberal Republican Facebook page eligible to promote posts again we are back. I currently live in Thailand and Facebook shut us down last Spring since our page is about American politics originating from a non-U.S. source. I assure you that I bear no resemblance to Vladimir Putin in any way whatsoever...but in any case it's good to be back.  Thailand is a middle income country of around seventy million people. There have been fifty-eight deaths here from the virus and only one local case in the last four months. Life has mostly returned to normal though almost everyone wears a mask temperatures are taken entering malls restaurants parks and stores and hand sanitizer is everywhere.  The resistance in the United States to masks and other steps routinely taken in countries in Asia and Europe to defeat the virus is regarded as insane and shameful to folks here...and in most of the world. And the fact that the resistance is framed in terms of Americans' constitutional rights--rights people in much of the rest of the world wish they had--is a horribly inaccurate framing of our rights.  Who thinks that in times of war drafting Americans to fight is an infringement of our Constitutional rights rather than an obligation of our citizenship? I doubt many of the Americans who refuse to wear masks today would be sympathetic to anyone making such an argument about serving in World War II or Vietnam. And in World War II Americans were drafted to do things like storm beaches with machine guns being fired at them as they did so. Being required to wear a piece of cloth around your mouth and nose is an infringement of your Constitutional rights? (Doing so is not an indication of weakness. It is a show of moral and ethical strength.) Lucky our soldiers in World Wars I and II Korea Vietnam Iraq and Afghanistan (though no American soldiers were drafted in the Afghanistan or Iraq conflicts) were more public minded. And lucky our elected officials didn't turn the other cheek when those few who refused their duty did so. Because the other thing here in Thailand and elsewhere around the world where the virus has been beaten back is the rules are enforced.  We are at war with the virus. The human casualties and devastation to our economy and social fabric are warlike devastation. As of the writing of this post the virus has killed more than 214500 Americans in less than nine months. By contrast 58209 Americans were killed in the Vietnam War between 1961 and 1975. 405399 Americans were killed in World War II in the five years between 1941 and 1945. And any American with a pulse has seen the economic devastation and tearing of our already torn social fabric the virus has wrought.  So it's a war but one that countries from Asia to Europe have shown can be won in a few months of sacrifice. But sacrifice means rules that are uniformly applied and enforced. To date America has been like patients who take half of the antibiotic prescribed and then stop or only remember to take it every other day then complain that they aren't better.  Our political leadership needs to look around the world and get with the program. Thailand's death rate from the virus would have translated to about three hundred deaths given the U.S. population of three hundred and thirty million. What the countries that have defeated the virus have done is not rocket science...certainly the country that put men on the moon more than half a century ago can do this.  Be well thanks for reading and check out the website please. I hope you will find some good ideas there for fixing our broken politics.,political,Facebook
"There is always a reason for everything isn't there? Our goal is to find out the truth.  Have you ever wondered why the Joliet Herald News almost always gives Mayor O'Dekirk and previous city attorney and interim city manager Marty Shanahan bad press?  Our group has been wondering about this for a few years now.  Why do some at the Herald news always seem to report the mayor in a bad light? Because we feel that Mayor O'Dekirk does do some good things. He attends about every event and meeting held in the city of Joliet. And he donates both his time and resources all the time. Even when the mayor helped out the St. Joe's nurses by providing ""port a potties"" for them during their strike Mayor O'Dekirk was painted as the ""bad guy"" in their article. It backfired though as the public stood with the nurses and the mayor. And the mayor delivers hundreds of food baskets every Christmas but we don't hear too much about that in the Herald news either. So why do they always criticize or paint him in a negative light in their articles? Just a week ago another ""hit article"" was put out by the herald news with sarcastic insults about the mayor and as usual it had nothing to do with the actual point of the article it's simply another ""hit"" towards the mayor.  Then there is Marty Shanahan. The Mudron 5 put him through hell this last year yet Marty did a great job as both interim city manager and as city attorney. Marty donated his time alsowhen there were crisis in the city he came out to help.  When the Guardian Angel home did their ""Dancing with the Stars"" fundraiser Marty joined in as a contestant. And he was one of the first people on the scene when city properties were in peril. And God knows Marty did his best to straighten out the police department heads. But that didn't go so good for him as the ""Mudron 5"" made sure to remove him as interim after his efforts.  But no positive articles for Marty either. Why is that?  Rumors are flying that the herald news has been struggling financially.  Realistically not many people order subscriptions for hard copies of the newspaper delivered to their homes anymore. That generation is aging out. And online subscriptions don't appear to be booming either. If you ever read the Herald news social media page you will see newer generations are complaining that they cannot see the articles and state that there is no way are they paying to see them. With the economy worsening people will cut our the small frivalties why pay for the news when you can read other online news for free?  Now obviously O'Dekirk and Shanahan didn't change the worlds view on buying the Herald news or cause the recession (although with some of the Herald news' articles being written about them you would assume that's all their fault too ) but we believe a bigger part of this hostility towards Mayor O'Dekirk and Marty Shanahan is about $$$$.  That's right this whole ""War of words"" could very well be about the almighty dollar or maybe 50 thousand or more of those mighty dollars per year.  Going through invoices from 2016 through 2020 the Joliet Herald News appears to have been the receiver of all of the city of Joliet's ""Legal notice"" business for a long time but as we searched we noticed the last few years of invoices for both news outlets it appears that during one of Shanahans tenure as Interim Manager a switch was made to the Labor Record in an effort to save taxpayer dollars.  Now you may not think that's a big deal but it adds up to a lot of money each year. Probably enough to pay a salary or maybe even two salaries for herald news employees.  The business that was pretty much taken away includes every announcement/notice for each council meeting each committee meeting such as economic development finance committee meetings as they must give notice for public comment. It further includes every Ad for job openings at the city every ""Bid"" that the city puts out for everything from lawn mowing and repairs to electrical contracts and new construction.  Our group went through almost 2000 FOIA invoices of these city's invoices.  One Ad in the Herald News for a job opportunity for a ""maintenance worker"" cost the City of Joliet taxpayers over $3200.00. That probably equals the salary for that sought out person's job for a month.  And we all know that city money is TAXPAYER MONEY.  By the drop in Shaw Media/Herald News invoices it appears that during Marty Shanahan's tenure at the city he decided to look for less expensive advertising to make sure Joliet taxpayers weren't overpaying for this service between 2017-18.  We will post a the numbers below but you can also look up the FOIA records for yourself to browse the change and the fee's that the city was/is paying through each newspaper.  So the next time you see the Herald News articles beating up on the Mayor and Shanahan know that the Herald may still be a little upset due to their loss of funding ""via city business""  The Labor Record invoice count for ads placed and paid through the city of Joliet:  2019: 160 invoices 2020 January to August: 86 invoices  The Joliet Herald News doing business as Shaw media invoice count for ads placed and paid through the city of Joliet:  2019: 11 invoices (some did have multiple ads included feel free to double this number count at best) 2020 January to August: 14 invoices (again feel free to double this count as some had multiple ads billed in one invoice)  We weren't planning on including 2018 but after counting the Labor Record who had 208 Ad Invoices the Herald Ad count was minimal compared to the 208 for the Labor Record so we didn't bother finishing a total for them as most will get the idea of the ""business shift"" at this point.  Does it seems a little bias we didn't separate the combined invoices from the Herald? Well Pot meet Kettle. Feel free to look through the FOIA's on the city of Joliet website and view for yourself.

Today is election day! Over the past few weeks I have been going door to door throughout our town discussing issues and meeting people. Our town is full of fine West Texas people and I have really enjoyed this opportunity.  Overall it seems folks are pleased with how things have been running here in Shallowater. We have kept our ambulance service going upgraded our water system improved our roads built a great city park and worked to adopt effective tax rates to do it all without tax increases.  If I am re-elected today I am eager to continue the work that we have been doing to keep our town a great place to live. Over the next couple years I look forward to seeing many new businesses open their doors as our rising population helps the economy grow.  If you haven't voted early be sure to cast your vote before 7pm today at the community center. Thank you for the opportunity to serve Shallowater these past four years and I hope to keep working!,political,Facebook
Modernity must be embraced in order to move our country towards stability and economic growth. We must be able to seek other careers rather than exclusively farming and cattle keeping. Current livestock and large farms require proper sanitation and good hygiene to prevent diseases and noise pollution. They attract raiding and clashes among communities over the smuggling of cows but do not need to be part of our future. As in many countries around the world the government could provide subsidies to farmers and cattle keepers for retraining to start new businesses which grow our countrys economy. The government needs to enact appropriate regulations to reduce the number of cattle and acres of farming per household to protect and prevent communities from these constant atrocities. Also owning less cows changes the demand for dowries which could reduce the usage of girls as commodities by their parents and would encourage education for all of us including our girls.  Polygamy is another complex issue in South Sudan which contributes to our high infant and maternal mortality rates. When physically immature girls get pregnant before age 18 after forced marriages they face life and death health issues in labor and delivery. After giving birth many of our young girls lack parental skills which results in high rates of child neglect domestic violence and mental health; including bonding to the infant which leads to other long-term problems in our communities. Poverty is common due to many males being unable to support multiple wives especially during an economic crisis. I believe our communities and government need to condemn polygamy and underage marriages. It would be the first step towards creating healing in our society.  It is impossible for the inhabitants of a country to be encouraged motivated and eager for growth when that country's government does not inspire trust and integrity. The people we vote into leadership need to be strong ethical leaders who are able to invoke power without bulldozing those around them and present a practical vision to build up our country. Why do we tend to base leadership and power on custom family background masculinity livestock and polygamy? Shouldnt leadership nominations be based on competency rather than custom and family background? People whose families are not popular but are qualified also deserve to have a chance to participate in leadership roles. It would be fair if leadership is not based on family background or masculinity and custom to prevent discouraging leaders whose parents are not well known but are professionally competent leaders. I believe that for our country to grow our community and government leaders should not be chosen based on traditional methods but on their ability to lead.  Key Points:  Government intervention in land usage  Government intervention in education focused on building our country  Government intervention in underage marriage  Government intervention in polygamy  Government intervention in the leadership nomination process  Government intervention in empowering women in leadership  Intervention within the functions of the government to create accountability and integrity  Change in grassroots attitudes towards these issues,political,Facebook
Today another candidate running for office decided to attack me while on the air of a popular radio show. That's politics and the better we do the more it is likely to happen.  Instead of using that time to talk about how he would improve our island this candidate chose to accuse me of a crime I didnt commit. While I've grown to expect this kind of politics it does hurt my family and those I care about deeply.  I've never seen a negative political attack put people back to work help a family pay down a mortgage or make health insurance more affordable for working families. Negative political attacks can't do that but together I know we can--and that is why I am asking for your vote.  I started this campaign because I have real plans to make Guam a better place for all that call it home. Because I believe in solutions like diversifying our economy expanding health insurance and investing in technology to improve government service.  If these ideas matter to you then allow me to work for you. Its that simple. My name is Chris Carillo.

"AN OPEN LETTER TO HARRISBURG FROM ERIC PAPENFUSE:  If you care about Harrisburgs future you need to know how important your vote in the upcoming election is to the City we love and call home.  I'll get right to the point. I have chosen to mount a write-in campaign for a third and final term as Mayorbut not for the reasons you may think. The unfortunate yet undeniable reality is that Wanda Williams is not only fundamentally unfit to lead Harrisburg forward but she will actually take us back to the days of pay-to-play politics cronyism and financial crisis.  Heres the truth. Although I fell 46 votes short in Mays Primary Election it is also true that Wanda Williams received the fewest votes of any Democratic nominee in the city's history. Over 70% of voters supported someone else so any claim to a mandate is just absurd.  And Republican nominee Tim Rowbottom is even less qualified with a lengthy criminal history including pending felony charges for strangulation and views so extreme he was publicly denounced by the Dauphin County Republican Committee.  I fell short this spring because I have consistently put the good of the city and its people over backroom party politics. Self-proclaimed old-school Democratic power brokers like James Pianka used my working with Republicans in the State Legislature against me. In reality I was simply doing the job I swore to do. By working together we got a new state law passed that extended the citys taxing authority to people living outside the city which generated hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. This means residents like YOU are able to receive the city services you deserve while also reducing your tax burden.  When it comes to policy I am by far the most progressive and proactive choice. Honestly it isn't even close. For example Wanda Williams voted against and is now blocking the formation of the Harrisburg Citizens Law Enforcement Advisory Committee for over a year now effectively preventing the police reform the city so clearly demands.  She is also currently using her position on City Council to block tens of millions of federal dollars from the American Recovery Act from reaching you and other city residents filibustering my plans to get those funds into the hands of the people and help our economy rebound. Shes also recklessly postponed a planned refinancing of the Citys remaining debt that would have saved taxpayers millions of dollars.  Why does she want to hold on to all of that money? Where does she want it to go? The lack of answers to these questions should concern everyone who cares about accountability and wants to root out public corruption. The sad reality is that lots of people want to take a cut of money every time the City spends it. Over the past 8 years I have consistently fought against this and stopped it from happening. But now Wanda Williams wants to open the door and let the wolves in.  By comparison I have a clear vision for my third and final term. Now that the city is financially stable we can move forward on an open and transparent agenda to improve the entire city. Just a few of these items include:   A complete repaving of all city streets  Rebuilding the city's swimming pools  Creating 2500 new affordable parking spaces  Ensuring the police reforms we have started are enacted  Partnering with schools and non-profits to create programs for our children  Ensuring more local minority contractors are included in city projects  The message is simple. After everything Harrisburg has gone through in recent years we cannot afford to go backward. The parties nominees lack both the temperament and judgment to lead Harrisburg. Luckily I have a proven track record of strong fiscal management ethical leadership and a relentless commitment to uniting the citys diverse voices. I will continue to work my hardest for you.  Because my name is not on the ballot you will have to write my name in; luckily the process is easy. Just fill in the dot for ""write-in"" and then write ""ERIC PAPENFUSE"" on the line.  If you have any questions or concerns I would love to hear from you. You can contact me on my website () email me at papenfuseformayor@gmail.com or call/text 717-415-5443. You can also stop by our Campaign HQ at 914 N 2nd St for signs or volunteer.  With a great sense of urgency and sincere hope for our future I humbly ask for your vote on November 2.

If We Fix Democracy We Can Fix the World  We have a two tier system a billionaire class of banks and corporations that control the money supply the media and our political system-and everyone else.  The United States came into being because the people no longer would accept monarchical rule unfair taxation and limits on their freedoms from a restrictive British aristocracy.  We do not need nor want a return to an aristocratic rule in a new guise; the billionaire class ruling our democracy Wall Street banks profiting from financial insolvency our politicians being bought and sold by their corporate sponsors and our freedoms limited by corporate leaders who have their own agenda.  The answer to this growing conundrum is to begin to limit the power of these entities through legislation and this can only be done through empowering the people to realize that regardless of the power that these billionaire banks and corporations have they cannot rule over us unless we give up our power to change our political system.  The two political parties no longer represent the people and despite their fancy words can only give lip service to a democracy that now represents the big banks and Wall Street.  Our Main Street economy is being decimated while our Wall Street economy is soaring. The proof is in the pudding.  If we fix our democracy we can fix the world. We have to try.,political,Facebook
Why do I stress the importance of education?  Education is something we can not inherit from our parents. This is why we treasure and invest heavily in our education system. Children have one opportunity to take advantage of the education our public schools have to offer.  Lets face it - what has transpired over the past two years has derailed our educational aspirations for our children. Our children are learning less and many are likely a full year behind where they would have been without lockdowns and the challenges of remote learning. This will undoubtedly have an impact on our children's future and financial well-being.  As the global economy continues to impact our industries at home we have to continuously evaluate whether the education we are imparting is reflecting the needs of our future workforce.  Life skill classes are an integral step in that direction. These classes include but are not limited to: financial literacy computers culinary arts sewing entrepreneurship and communications. Such courses help children tap into skills that they otherwise might never have had a chance to experience better preparing them for future careers.  I am committed to working with the district to create innovative programs that will instill children with the knowledge and the confidence to navigate today's ever changing competitive environment.  #MahwahSchools #MahwahBoardOfEducation #MahwahBoardOfEd,political,Facebook
Next Tuesday May 18th Vote Alan Watkins for Lake City Mayor!!  I decided to run for Mayor this year to do more to help Lake City come together as a community. I would like to see some positive change and collaboration; we can accomplish so much more in our town if we can work together and form positive relationships.  Growing up I learned that you need to treat people fairly respect different opinions and learn from your mistakes. As mayor I promise to maintain the same high standards that I set for myself and that we should all demand from our elected officials. Lake City is and will remain a great community. But we seem to have grown accustomed to stagnation in our economy to cronyism in our halls of power and to indifference to the everyday problems of our citizens. This town deserves something more. And I intend to deliver it. Thanks for the continuing support.,political,Facebook
Delco & Philly (PA-5) are projected to receive $20.8M in funding in the $547 billion INVEST in America Act. Nearly 15% is earmarked for bike lanes. The rest will go to expand several SEPTA stations and improve safety at rail and pedestrian crossings.  Is this what a century-defining transformation of infrastructure looks like? Is it fixing our roads and bridges that need it most? Building new highways? Funding projects worth the cost because we are sure they will have generational impacts on our infrastructure and economy? Not in Delco or Philly.  Yes we must fix our roads bridges and enhance the safety of our systems of transport. But Congress is talking about spending north of $1 trillion total over the coming months. If that's the case we need more than what we are slated to get.

Is it possible to gaslight the entire country?  What do you get when you cross an insatiable desire for power raging hatred of anyone opposed to your agenda and a monumental lack of self-awareness? You get the modern democrat (Keystone Cop) party and their endless list of failed gaslighting and disinformation operations. Gaslighting and disinformation operations are similar in that both are used to create a false narrative. They differ in that gaslighting is an attempt to make us believe something completely different from the facts that we know and see to be true. Disinformation operations put out false information that we dont know to be false at the time. The Russia collusion hoax was a classical disinformation campaign as were the Kavanaugh hearings and the impeachment hearings of President Trump.  For those of you who dont know the term gaslight came about because of a movie by the same name released way back in 1944. The movie is about a husband who is trying to make his wife think she is going insane by telling her that things she thought were happening were not and that things she thought were not happening indeed were. This brings us to the current gaslighting projects by the democrats.  We are completely surrounded like fish in water by their gaslighting projects with the news media politicians and talking heads being the primary provocateurs. Take for instance the rioting and destruction that the democrats have encouraged promoted and funded. They have taken to going in front of any camera and making the claim that President Trump is the cause of the rioting. Now there is video evidence of President Trump offering any support needed to stop the violence in its tracks. Unfortunately many democrat controlled cities have refused his offer because they want to allow their cities to devolve into utter chaos. The democrats trying to blame President is like telling us that the Sun rises in the North and sets in the South. It is clear that democrat operatives are causing and perpetrating the violence and destruction including the assassination of police officers.  The latest gaslight operation to bring Trump down is the accusation that he publicly downplayed the dangers of the KungFluenza as he privately talked about how serious it was. One of the first responsibilities of a leader is to not instill panic so his comments were measured and responsible in that regard. The first responsibility of the democrats is to instill as much panic as possible so that the American people will willingly surrender as much freedom as possible to the democrats. Trumps comments measured as they were werent much different than those of health officials including Anthony Fauci that we heard with our own ears.  Now what did we see from President Trump? We saw him be the first world leader to ban travel from China and then from Europe and other hot spots. He mobilized the private sector to make available needed medical equipment that irresponsible state officials neglected to do. He held a daily briefing for the American people to stay informed about the progression of the disease and the progress on getting needed medical supplies and standing up mobile hospitals. While he was trying to instill calm his actions showed that he took the virus very seriously.  One of the funniest gaslighting operations to watch are the talking head panels on the left wing Propaganda Ministry networks. You should know that democrats use these panels for purposes of the appeal to authority. Viewers are expected to see the panelists as knowledgeable and wise and therefore are expected believe everything the panelists say. As each one makes assertions about Trump and America that we know to be lies the others are sitting there nodding their heads in agreement. The nods are supposed to impart to the viewers that what they are hearing is the consensus of the anointed. And after one of them says something spectacularly stupid that we are supposed to believe and there is that brief silence until another picks up the conversation I keep getting the sense that a punch line is coming just like at the end of any good joke.  We could go on and on here with different examples but I think you get the point. The problem the democrats have is that they are stuck in the past while living in an era of modern technology in the form of social media playback and satellites that can send information around the world the moment it happens. Leftist gaslighting operations cant overpower that. We can see for ourselves in real time who is doing what to whom and who is supporting it. We know which party is supporting the violence in our streets and which party is opposed to it. We know which party supports destroying the economy and which party supports strengthening it. Lastly we know which party believes in America and which party hates America. The age old communist and Nazi tactic of repeating a lie over and over until it becomes the truth simply no longer works.,political,Facebook
"ENVIRONMENT VS. ECONOMY The philosophy that holds the environment and the economy to be in conflict with each other is a misguided farce. It is only major corporations with very specific self-serving interests who posit that the economy and environment are in conflict with each other. The health of the environment is directly related to the economy especially here in Maine where the super-majority of our state's revenue is directly related to ecological tourism and environmentally based industries. It is our national and state parks lakes oceans woods and mountains that stimulate the economy here -- by attracting people to fish hunt hike bird watch snowmobile ski swim boat; by providing a bounty of natural resources to support agricultural and forest industries that yield paper products blueberries potatoes fisheries and more. Without a healthy environment in Maine we have nothing to subside on. Ultimately there are two immediately pressing environmental concerns that are tied together: climate change and the capacity of human culture to adapt (and adapt QUICKLY) to address the infrastructural transformations needed to meet the challenge of climate change. While it may be obvious that climate change is the single most environmental issue affecting Maine the deeper question is ""Do we have the capacity to change society to address the issue?"" The solutions are all readily available. Science has given us a multitude of solutions to immediately combat climate change. The only thing holding back is the political will to start TODAY to implement the solutions we know can reverse our current climate trajectory. The biggest obstacle is political will. Time and time again the major political parties have proven that they do not have the foresight or ability to take initiative swiftly enough to make a difference before it is too late.

"When I was teaching students in my classroom and their parents said ""Once a Rigano's Raider always a Rigano's Raider."" I wouldn't have it any other way.  After 31 years as a professional educator with 24 of those years in Beavercreek and 18 years as a business owner I know about operating a budget building relationships organizing people and the important role schools play in a child's life.  The great experiences I have shared with over 1000 students in my career families business partners and wonderful community members has led to my decision to retire from teaching and run for a seat on the Beavercreek Board of Education.  I believe that a Board of Education must build relationships with everyone who has a stake in the school district: Students and their parents; Employees of the school district and; Taxpayers who don't have students in our schools.  You might ask: ""Why is it important to engage people who don't have kids in the public schools?"" The answer is in an article entitled ""Perspectives"" written by Michael Goar executive director of Generation Next ""As the Schools Go So Goes the City"" he states. The article points out that ""Quality public schools improve the local economy and attract business. Schools educate the local labor force and increase the areas quality of life by attracting skilled workers. Educated individuals enjoy a higher standard of living and increased social capital.""  We must engage all of our stakeholders by utilizing new and improved communication strategies. Just like in the classroom students will participate if they understand the relevance of a project.  The top priority for any school district is the quality of education that we provide to our community. Our students must begin their learning careers at a very young age. Our role is to instill a love of learning until they graduate from high school to become productive citizens and life-long learners.  I have been very fortunate in my teaching career just as I have been in business. Eighteen years ago a partner and I ventured into the world of retail. The business is continues making a profit today. Assessing daily operations comparing the results to standards and making changes to enhance efficiencies is one the keys to success.

"CAPITAL GAINS TAX HIKE  There is much conversation in regards to President Biden's proposed capital gains tax increase. The standard arguments are troped out against the tax hike: it will hurt investment interest rates will rise some guy won't be able to buy a yacht.  A tax rise is not necessary to fund Biden's infrastructure-plus proposals but because people practically have a heart attack whenever the federal deficit is brought up it would probably be wise to close the deficit with a higher long term capital gains tax in order to save people the heartache. But there are other reasons as well.  Currently assets sold after holding that asset for more than a year are taxed at highly favorable long term capital gains tax rates of between 0% and 20% depending on the tax bracket; while assets sold within a year of purchase are taxed at generally higher ordinary income tax rates. The long term favorable rate is to encourage investors to make long term investments rather than to engage in short term speculative trading which arguably has less if any social value. Biden proposes raising the long term rate to 39.6 percent which when combined with the current 3.8% investment surtax on high income investors would create a long term federal capital gains tax of 43.4% on high income investors.  As talked about often on this Page taxes and borrowing are not necessary to fund Federal spending. The U.S. with its own currency can create as much money as it would like it is not dependent on funding sources. Taxation and borrowing are necessary however to take money out of the economy in order to control inflation in the goods services and asset markets; taxation and borrowing are also effective tools for interest rate targeting; also Treasury securities are useful for investment portfolio stability; and taxation is useful to direct capital into socially useful purposes and for wealth distribution purposes.  The effect of the long term capital gain tax increase would be several fold and we will touch upon a couple likely impacts. ""According to the Tax Policy Center the top 1% of households report 75% of long-term capital gains."" (Wall Street Journal April 24 2021). If this report is correct then the tax rise is likely to fall mostly on the top 1%. It is difficult to see how this would be a problem. The top 1% are fabulously wealthy and a tax increase would likely not crimp their consumption patterns. In other words the tax will come out of asset holdings and this is good for a couple reasons. The sale of assets in order to pay the tax should deflate what many argue are inflated asset markets. Less money chasing these assets will deflate overvalued asset prices. This is a good thing. Also the wealthy who pay this tax will consequently be less wealthy and this will beneficially reduce the wealth gap which tears at the Nation's social fabric. That's two good things to come from raising the tax. If by chance the higher tax crimps consumption spending among the wealthy a third good thing would happen: less consumption. The well-off consume too much. This is damaging both to the environment and as stated undermines communal values.  To the extent that the higher capital gains tax filters down to those beneath the top 1% the same arguments can be made only in different proportions as consumption takes on a larger proportion of the consumption-investment mix. There are many good reasons to increase the long term capital gains tax. There are also counter arguments.  The first being that the higher tax will discourage asset sales which will lead to an inefficient allocation of resources. On the other hand the slower turnover of assets would reduce the dynamism in the U.S. economy which leaves many workers often gasping for breath in the rapidly changing job market. The follow-up argument is the depletion of private capital will cause interest rates to rise; this is a difficult argument to make as the Federal Reserve (FED) since the Financial crisis has demonstrated an ability to successfully target interest rates from short to long term rates across the yield curve. Another argument is that higher taxes on the wealthy will create a shortage of private capital for investment. This is similar to the interest rate argument but is somewhat different and there are two aspects to it. There are two types of capital: debt and equity capital--equity being the at-risk capital that owners put-up when they invest in a business.  To the extent that money is borrowed or debt created or derived from the commercial banking sector the argument that higher capital gains tax rates will reduce the availability of debt capital is nonsense. If banks see good lending opportunities the loans will be made. Commercial banks create new money when they lend and this new money creation is limited only by a typical 10% reserve requirement. If banks were to find themselves short of reserves a near impossibility given the current environment in which banks are awash in excess reserves the FED will willingly provide the necessary reserves in order to protect the payments system. In terms of shrinking the pool of equity capital there is likely merit to this argument. But as stated earlier with asset markets likely inflated anything which absorbs excessive liquidity out these markets is a good thing.  In the end the capital gains tax increase represents a transfer of resources from the private sector where much investment is channeled into obnoxious and environmentally damaging consumption production to the public sector for long overdue physical and human capital infrastructure development which in the long term will support the private sector.  While there may be elements of the tax which require scrutiny generally the tax represents an advance forward for a nation which has suffered broad public disinvestment in order to serve the short term profit desires of the private sector during the past 40 years of neoliberal nonsense.",political,Facebook

SOCIALISM AND DEMOCRACY  One objection to socialism is that the individual will become subservient to the state. If handled correctly the objection is easily challenged and shown to be more likely true of a private sector dominated economy. The statement itself presumes one variant of socialist designa model groomed in our minds by the powers-that-be who have a short term interest in portraying socialism in a manner which none of us would want to endure.  Socialism is herein defined as an ideology which embraces a commitment to create an economy which serves the needs of all people. This is different from capitalism which is premised on the belief that an economy based on individual competition will best serve humanity. Under capitalism community planning is kept to a minimum and competitive market forces direct activity. The belief is that any individual can prosper within this economic framework.  The later statement is false as there is a wage structure within capitalism which is dictated by the goal of price stability. It is possibly true for the sake of argument that anyone can achieve prosperity in a capitalist economy but not everyone can simultaneously do so because that would be inflationary.  With this understanding socialist seek to overcome the inflation barrier to wage increases. We should also seek to eliminate market value pricing for lifes basic necessities such as simple housing food utilities healthcare and education. These items should be available regardless of affordability while individuals if they are able participate in the private or public sector workforce or in a federal job guarantee program. Market pricing should be left to the extra items of consumption such as restaurants entertainment fast cars and other luxuries. If one makes a meaningful contribution to the national work effort then one ought to be assured of the basic needs of life.  Only through government can the above be achieved and this does not imply subservience to the state. It implies democracy. The libertarian minded fear rule by the democratic majority thus their emphasis on private power and property; their concerns however are overblown. The U.S. with its history of strong civil rights protection through the Bill of Rights will continue to protect these rights as few of us would be willing to cede territory in this realm.  Most of us would prefer to not have to deal with government. But the question becomes do you want to be ruled by a bunch of wealthy people the inevitable result of a more pure private market economy no disrespect intended or would you rather be ruled by people with life experiences and concerns closer to your own. If the latter this can only be achieved through government unless of course you are wealthy. But the vast majority of us are not wealthy so it would seem we would want to self-rule through government and not to be ruled by powerful private sector actors over which we exercise no democratic control.  The government should be our agent and agency is more easily achieved in a body in which we have a vote. Contrariwise without a vote in private corporations non shareholders in a governmentless world would become subject to private sector corporate whims. The private market left to its own devices would take us to a feudal era of CEO kings and knighted management complete with private armies and tolls as we passed over corporate borders.  The fatal flaw in the capitalist argument that socialism will subdue the individual is that without government we would live under the tyranny of private corporate powers. Without popular restraint against private power there would be no minimum wage no concern for the unemployed no restraint on environmental destruction and on and on it would go. It is only through government that we are able to control the competitive forces which would otherwise subject us to its will. Greed the premise of the capitalist economy would rule the day.  A preview of this has been on display during the last forty years during which we have witnessed the social fabric of nation after nation get shredded under the neoliberal agenda of deregulation privatization austere budgets and a general lowering of national wage bills through International Monetary Fund and World Bank structural adjustment programs. Further evidence is provided in the U.S. and in other developed nations where barely bridled corporate power has facilitated large scale disinvestment which has driven wage rates for many workers into the ground.  The unfortunate thing is that private sector wealth has grown to such an extent that it has overpowered government and government has become the agent of this wealth limited only to the extent the rest of us engage in democratic restraint of this power. Power has moved upward; this is undemocratic.  The problem is not government the problem is who or what controls government. Currently government is controlled by human agents infused with a spirit of self-interested competitive behavior all morally justified by the paradoxical argument that competitive environments do not create losers. You simply cannot have it both ways.  The point is to make government work for the people not solely for the upper echelons of financial and corporate power. Socialism is about increased democracy not less despite the story told by unknowing often authentic other times cynical mouthpieces for the status quo.,political,Facebook

Recently my opponent made yet another false and misleading claim about me as a person - suggesting that I have no idea what it takes to create jobs.  In ten years I have never lowered myself to false or misleading attacks as part of a political campaign. I simply won't do it. I believe it is our responsibility as candidates to showcase our records our ideas our principles and what we would actually do if elected. I have always done that and will continue to do so.  However I will also defend myself when necessary.  My bio including my work experience is on my website For the record I have managed several different insurance agencies over the years and have hired and trained dozens of employees -insurance agents and customer service reps. I also work as a recruiter in real estate training and mentoring new and experienced agents alike. I have created many jobs through my investments in real estate and my appreciation for a free market economy.  More importantly in my role as a State Senator I recognize that my job is not to create jobs but rather to create an environment so others can do so. This is why I have worked hard to support policies beneficial to that goal and oppose others that prevent it. I have a 100% voting record from both the CBIA and NFIB the two leading pro-business groups in our state.      It is interesting that my opponent has previously attacked me for my efforts to prevent a premature and drastic increase in the minimum wage to $15.00 and the improperly funded new payroll tax required under the new paid FMLA law.  I urge anyone who is in favor of increasing the minimum wage to watch my remarks from the Senate debate in their entirety. This is an issue that sounds simple but has far-reaching impact.    Those two bills themselves are job killers. I wonder. How does one position themselves to be both pro-business and job creation while supporting more regulatory burdens and accepting the endorsement of the pro-socialism and anti business Working Families party?

Im excited to announce my candidacy for the unexpired term of Cleveland Heights' vacant city council seat.  I am running because:   I want to see our city to become a model of what can be done at the local level to become truly SUSTAINABLEnot just energy transition but also adopting regenerative practices and preparing for climate change impacts.   I want our city council to be mindful that we work for everyone who lives here even when communities have no one on council who directly represents them. We must be keenly aware of our gaps in REPRESENTATION. We must be intentional about connecting with overlooked communities and listening to people who feel ignored and forgotten.   I want our city to build a thriving diverse LOCAL ECONOMY that will serve our peoples needs help us attract new residents and make us more resilient in the face of larger economic fluctuations.   I want our local leaders to think more expansively about what QUALITY OF LIFE really means and then invest accordingly to create a city that offers our residents the opportunities and security needed to be safe healthy prosperous and connected.   I am a COLLABORATOR a PROBLEM-SOLVER and a COMMUNICATOR. I am ready to work with our residents and our future mayor and councilmembers to get things done and make our city what we all know it can be.  On January 1 2022 we will have an almost entirely new city government. This is an opportunity for a fresh beginningnew ideas new vision new culture at City Hall.

"Lowering Taxes   This post is another rather long discussion akin to my articles on lowering the fair market value of your home for tax assessment purposes or providing guidance on how to improve (not solve) our citys traffic problems and other issues.  Let me explain how we go about lowering taxes. I need to do this because some folks don't understand about the millions in extra revenue we're getting from sales taxes and other sources.  The discussion can be a little complicated to follow if you are not that versed in budgets and how to manage them. I tried to keep it simple so please try to read the whole post. It may take you a few minutes.  City cash reserves are also covered which is now at an astonishing 50% ($20M) of the annual city budget of around $40M. This is the citizen's money and should be given back to them by way of a reasonable tax cut.  Here's how it all comes together. My opponents are welcome to review it dispute it submit their own plans etc. However debating is how we obtain the best solution.  Let's start with Special Purpose Local Option Sales Tax (SPLOST) and how it can be leveraged with our general fund to ""free up"" more than a couple million dollars. In the 4th year of SPLOST ending June 30 2021 PTC was budgeted to receive $7638091. We actually received $10068254! That's over $2.4M additional revenue than planned.  We are budgeted to receive similar amounts for years 5 and 6 of SPLOST; i.e. $7764120 and $7892228. I know this because I was on the negotiating team for the city when we worked out the income distribution percentages from SPLOST with the county. We can reasonably expect over $10M again over each of the next two years giving us about $5M extra unplanned for revenue over those two years alone.  I am not so nave to think a recession is not going to happen. It will. But like the worst recession in our lifetime back in 2008 and for several years thereafter our sales tax revenue in today's terms never went below $8M. I know this because I was on council during the recession time and we had to make our city budget work. We were extraordinarily successful. We would still be ahead over the next couple years even if the biggest recession since 1929 hit us now. This is great news to be in this position.  How do you leverage this extra money with our general fund budget? Easy. Just like with the CARES money (i.e. the COVID relief money from the Federal and State governments passed down to Peachtree City to the tune of nearly $2M); we used it to pay our police and fire department personnel instead of using the general fund. This was an unplanned budget windfall and we took advantage of it by taking $2M that was in the general fund and put it in city cash reserves. That was fantastic and its called leveraging.  Now with SPLOST we can do the same thing only with road and cart path maintenance. For example next years SPLOST we can expect again well over $2M more than budgeted and planned for as explained above. SPLOST is currently set up to spend over $5.3M on road and cart path maintenance next year. New paths are budgeted separately. Our general fund is set up to ALSO spend about $7M on road and cart path maintenance next year.  For the last 4 years weve poured about $12M/year into road and cart path maintenance. We will continue to do this for at least another 2 years. That will have been $72M into the maintenance program. In two years we will be just about caught up and can go into a mode of annual maintenance of $7M/year to stay on top of things. This was the plan 5 years ago and we have accomplished it with SPLOST.  Heres the leveraging part: since were getting an additional $2M next year from SPLOST replace $2M of general fund money for road and cart path maintenance with the extra SPLOST money freeing up $2M from the general fund. Voila! You still have $12M for the year going into road and cart path maintenance but now you now have $2M to spend on increasing police and fire department personnel salaries lowering storm water bills to once a year and still have enough for cutting the property tax rate 0.5 mills.  Our tax millage rate can be lowered from over 6 mills to about 5.5 mills. Doing it over 2 years with 0.25 decreases is a potential option. It needs to be done. This is important as we have been pricing ourselves out of more industry coming to PTC because they see how easily PTC city council has in the past raised taxes the last three years (not this year of course because its an election year).  Industries see our sister AAA credit rated cities of Alpharetta and Roswell at 4.7 and 4.9 mills and would rather go there for the money savings instead of PTC. I would. Yes we have 100 miles of cart paths but industries are interested in money and profit first. The cart path maintenance requirement is why I would not go much lower than around 5.5 mills because we do need to maintain those paths. Those other cities dont have this special requirement.  Now for more frosting on the cake budget wise. Lets talk about Local Option Sales Tax (LOST) not SPLOST. Both are sales taxes. Briefly on the SPLOST which is that extra 1 cent sales tax after the 6 cents per dollar we pay. SPLOST was voted on by the county citizens. I was the biggest champion of that 1 cent knowing how huge a revenue source it would be.  Compared to the property tax mill rate we get over triple the value with SPLOST. For example 1 mill equates to about $2.8M in revenue right now. It also equates to about $150/average household. All round numbers of course. We actually have council members saying they would raise the mill rate 3 mills (even 4 mills) to obtain needed extra money.  Why would anyone do something like that and chase away any remaining business and industry here in PTC and guarantee no new business or industry ever again looks at PTC? However the 1 cent SPLOST as you now know gains us over $10M/year and costs the average household about the same as only 1 mill. There is no dispute SPLOST is at least triple the value of the mill.  Now back to LOST. This is the 6 cent/dollar sales tax in Fayette County. The first 4 cents go to the state (about $100M/year). 1 cent goes to the Fayette County Board of Education (this is huge for them). The last 1 cent of the 6 cents gets divided up similarly to the SPLOST tax between the county and 4 cities (Peachtree City Fayetteville Tyrone and Brooks) within the county.  Looking at FY2021 (this year) we budgeted last Fall $7321045 for LOST revenue. We are on pace to receive over $9.4M. Thats over $2M more than anticipated and again a huge windfall for the city. This is why the finance director Upped the budgeted amount of LOST for FY2022 to $9.373M. This is more accurate for the expected revenue.  The new budgeted amount is still hopefully a lower amount than what we will actually wind up with but thats what you do in budgeting like this. No budget is ever 100% spot on unless you are dealing with fixed amounts. You plan for lower revenues and higher expenses than expected. This is just the way we do things in the budget world. We try to be relatively close but no one is ever 100% accurate.  Now add in the $2M CARES money we got in FY2021 and thats over $6.5M MORE than anticipated ($2.5 SPLOST $2M LOST and $2M CARES). Oh how I wish I were on city council right now. This is the exact opposite of the problems Vanessa Doug Kim Don and I had to deal with on city council back in 2010. In our citys 5 year financial model we were about $22M in the red! Our city budget was only about $25M/year at the time.  It took 5 years to dig ourselves out of the hole to where we had a balanced budget i.e. no tax increases nor use of city reserves in the 5 year model. This is why I voluntarily stepped down from council deciding not to run again for another 4 year term in 2015. I had accomplished what I set out to do. I said No its time for someone else to have the privilege and honor of being a council member. You cannot name a single council member in the last 10 years who has voluntarily stepped down. It seems they all want to be career politicians.  With all this money rolling in anyone who says we cant afford a tax cut is simply a defeatist. We have so much money now in city reserves plus the extra money we know is coming in that is not budgeted we can afford a half mill tax cut.  I want to lower our city reserves to around 35% not keep it at 50%. 35% is still way higher than our ordinance requires but this is YOUR money and I believe you know how to spend it better than the government. Anyone care to debate that?  Giving you a tax break cutting our stormwater bill making sure our city employees especially police and fire department (in fact all of our city employees) are the best paid is important to me. We have the money lets do it. With proper financial oversight it is not that big a risk. Everything has risk but with our huge city reserves the risk is acceptable.  I foresee at least 10 years in the future of lower tax rates while still keeping our reserves above 35%. I see our sewer bills being lowered because we will be paying off one of the huge multimillion dollar loans in a few years. Look for that around 2024 if not earlier. Turn me loose with the budget with the collective wisdom of our city hall financial staff along with others on council and we can leverage (theres that word again) the economy of scale of having both a public works department and Water and Sewer Authority (WASA) capital assets to lower the sewer bill for you.  Yes we can do all this. The choice is yours on November 2nd. Turn the city over to those without a financial background or you can ask me a professional program manager to lead the way to do all this  without being paid!  Thats right I will not accept the mayors salary over 4 years of $86400 and instead donate it back to the city. I consider being on city council a volunteer job not requiring pay. Peachtree City has given me and my family so much its time to give back.  It seems some of my opponents are upset that I'm going to donate the mayoral salary of $86400 over 4 years back to the city if I'm elected Mayor. I'm sorry they feel that way. I would rather give back to my city than take away from it. I think public service is that ... public service akin to volunteering. (And for a very LIMITED time.)  Just so you know: Airport Authority members volunteer. They do not receive a salary. Planning Commission members volunteer. They do not receive a salary. Convention & Visitors Bureau (CVB) members volunteer. They do not receive a salary. Water Sewer Authority members are volunteers. They do not receive a salary. The Finance Committee of Peachtree City are volunteers. They do not receive a salary. The head of Keep Peachtree City Beautiful (KPTCB) is a volunteer. He does not receive a salary. When I was on the Recreation Commission as a member I did not receive a salary.  There are many other examples of citizens stepping up and volunteering to make our city better. A lot of these folks work way harder and volunteer way more time than a city council member sitting there on the dais twice a month. (Yes I know they do other things.) If you need the salary take it. It's what our charter/ordinances say. But one is not forced to accept it.  I hope all the candidates for office and current council members read this essay. Im sure they will have learned a lot and realize the powerful position and potential of our wonderful city. Its up to the city council to set the policy in the future not city staff. Anything I can do to make Peachtree City better is what Im all about. Bottom line I find ways to get things done not excuses not to.",political,Facebook
MODERN MONETARY THEORY: MISREPRESENTED ONCE AGAIN  Recently on a Bloomberg financial podcast a senior executive at J.P. Morgan stated he did not believe in Modern Monetary Theory (MMT). MMT is a controversial monetary theory which offers a description of monetary operations which challenge orthodox economic and financial thinking. Within current MMT reasoning there is a belief there is room for fiscal expansion which when coordinated with the Nation's central bank--the Federal Reserve (FED) will enable public investment in human and physical capital i.e. infrastructure without inflationary consequences. The J.P. Morgan executive argued that in order for MMT to succeed that it would also have to fail: that to accumulate the debt which he implies is acceptable to MMT for public investment then even if the investment proved good for the economy the accumulated debt would then tank the economy.  It was the strangest comment that one could expect from an investment banker and it also misrepresented MMT views. First from an investment banker perspective it is strange to state that debt issuance condemns an institution to failure. Bankers afterall are peddlers of private sector debt issued on the belief that the gains from private investment will generally exceed the cost of capital. Government debt issued in order to facilitate productive investment: physical and human likewise has the potential to create long term gains in the economy which exceed the cost of capital. So it was strange to hear an investment banker ignore the growth potential associated with public debt issuance which finances physical and human capital investment: the type of investment promoted within the MMT framework.  The MMT public sector investment portfolio would include such things as green energy investment in education and most importantly a federal job guarantee program which would offer a job to anyone who seeks a job at a livable wage with health and child care benefits--a near full employment program.  A legitimate concern here should not be the level of debt so long as the associated funds are directed into productive investment but the concern should be the potential inflationary impact of large scale investment which creates individual earnings not yet matched by an increase in the provision of consumer goods and services. The temporary mismatch between increased earnings from new investment and the availability of goods and services may create short to medium term inflationary pressures in these consumer markets. One market concern undoubtedly is the belief that once inflation begins it feeds on itself into an upward spiral of increased inflationary pressure which can only be resolved through monetary and fiscal tightenings i.e. an induced recession.  It is not clear to me whether MMT has adequately addressed the short term inflationary impact of broad public infrastructure investment. MMT definitely recognizes that Federal spending is limited by potential inflationary effects of Federal spending and it seems they differ from the broader market participants in their view of the size and scope of available resources which can be put to work before real resource restraints create inflationary pressure. In other words it seems that MMT believes there currently exists greater slack in the economy than the broader market participants believe and it also seems that MMT believes that increased productive capacity which meets consumer demand can come online rather quickly in order to thwart these inflationary pressures. The latter view is undoubtedly challenged in a trade restricted environment.  It appears that MMT takes the long view and the bigger point is that green energy will eventually be a more efficient source of energy while high tech education combined with liberal arts training will make us both more productive and better citizens. The federal jobs programs will assist in the development of work skills which will further enhance national productivity. Debt used to finance such activity would be a very good use of debt and will not inflict damage on the national economy but rather will enhance long term growth in a noninflationary manner.  Much of the above discussion is premised on a misrepresentation of the MMT view on public debt. The J.P. Morgan Executive's view is premised on the idea that Federal deficit spending must be funded with debt. This is not the MMT view. Federal debt issuance is a policy option not a requirement for deficit spending.  The MMT view is that a sovereign monetary authority such as the U.S. which creates its own free floating currency creates money when it spends and destroys money through taxation and borrowing. Money creation and money destruction need not be equal. Spending need not be fully funded but only 'funded' to an extent and in a manner which prevents inflation in the goods services and asset markets. In other words deficit spending need not be funded with debt: the money for deficit spending is created through the act of spending. An equivalent debt issuance merely destroys an equal amount of money thereby neutralizing any inflationary impact of the deficit spending. Debt issuance i.e. money destruction is a mere tool for inflation control and for other convenient purposes i.e. private portfolio investment stability store of value interest rate targeting . . . .  Furthermore the Executive's narrative ignored debt management techniques discussed previously on this Page such as debt extinguishment the Platinum coin idea which grew out of the 2011 budget ceiling crisis taxation of the well-off rather than borrowing from the well-off and Federal Reserve perpetual holdings of Treasury debt on its balance sheet--which is costless to the U.S. taxpayer. The Executive's brief discussion of MMT was yet another false representation of MMT views.  Generally it is wise to dismiss about 85% of corporate reporting on MMT. Most commentators have not seriously examined MMT; others are in no mood to change the status quo. Large capital interests in the private sector simply do not want to concede additional space to the public sector regardless of the long term growth potential associated with public sector investment.  Undoubtedly the Nation's long term productivity potential would be greatly enhanced by the above public sector investments. But in the long run the current investment class won't be here. Perhaps this is part of the problem. The other part of the problem lies in the short term investment horizon of private sector firms a response to investor demands for short term profits which do not align with the long term investment objectives of the Federal government.,political,Facebook

I have lived in Medford my entire life. I have been married to my wife Jessie a local school teacher for 15 years and have three school aged children. Before completing High School I started framing homes and soon started my own framing company. Later in 2009 to the present I moved to my true passion and started a security company to provide all your security needs under one name. I love Medford and want to protect it and ensure it grows and thrives for your family and mine.  I first got interested in running for the city council in 2010 after listening to the council member's radical ideas for Medford. I wanted to ensure Medford had someone that could help protect the voters. Unfortunately we currently have two radical council members representing Ward 3. If you elect me I will be the counterbalance to Kevin Stine.  Issue 1 - Tax and fee increases. We continue to be assaulted by tax and fee increases from our current city council. We were all misled to believe the new pool complex wasn't going to cost us anything. That was a lie; everyone's utility bill increased because third-party organizations backed by council members misled the voters. I vow to never vote for a fee or tax increase while on the council. All tax increases should go to the voter on election day. Do we want to be taxed to death like California?  Issue 2 - Transient population We have a massive issue with transients in Medford. These are not people that were forced onto the streets from uncontrolled circumstances. These are people on the streets by choice or they lack the mental capacity to take care of themselves. The state needs mental institutions that can get these mentally challenged people the help they need. At the same time the city needs to do its part and clean out the greenway. There is a more efficient method to do this without putting expensive police officers on the path. The private sector is the answer.  Issue 3 - Economy As a business owner I have essential insight that I believe will help Medford be a beacon that will attract new business and grow our local economy. I find it interesting the Chamber of Commerce endorsed my opponent that has no business experience. Do they want Medford to grow?  What separates me from the others? Simple I only have one interest in running for council to Make Medford Great. No special interest group will control me. That's a guarantee.  Facebook: Don Libby for Medford,political,Facebook
"""Dear Leader"" Donald Trump is not a leader... Donald Trump is an instigator.  He claims that if Biden is elected ... America will burn. News Flash! ... America is burning as his tweets provide fuel for right-wingers to confront rightful protesters of racial injustice and police brutality.  We need ""Gentleman"" Joe to quell the fires that go beyond peaceful protests and to push back not enable hateful armed right-wing fanatics.  Donald Trump did not and still has not led on Covid 19...he confused it with ""Covfefe"" 17. Covid is not a HOAX ""Covfefe"" is a product of his mental deficiencies.  Donald Trump did not and still is not leading on an economic collapse that has millions out of work... out of food... and likely sleeping in cars or on concrete slabs.  We need ""Genteel"" Joe a man that knows the pain of loss be it his wife or children or be it those that have lost employment food and a place to rest due to Covid 19.  ""Genteel"" Joe will reach across the political divide and work with reasonable Republicans (some exist) to provide temporary relief followed by a rebuild of the economy beginning with the nation's dilapidated infrastructure. (No the stock market is not the economy it is currently unsupported speculation fueled by cheap money. It does little to directly help those currently suffering economic uncertainty.)  Donald Trump is not an anti-war activist. His embrace of Putin and Kim and other authoritarian leaders is not meant to keep peace it is simple adoration of ""tough guys"".  Trump sees himself as a ""tough guy"" tough guys he believes are winners. And Trump always aims to win be it by lawsuits bankruptcies defrauding his own charities his Trump University students or contractors. Most importantly he aims to win by supressing voters' ability to cast ballots by mail or through long poll lines.  ""Flak Jacket"" Joe will not take flak from Putin nor Kim Joe is in the Know when it comes to dealing with dictators. He won't instigate conflict with them but he will employ his years of foreign policy experience (Obama had none) to counter them and keep them at bay.  Nor is Trump an environmental activist. Just as with Covid whether or not a product of human activities it is not a HOAX! Climates are changing and whether we fight the changes or adjust to them we must respond or suffer health economic and environmental calamities including wide-spread forest fires.  ""Fire-Jumper"" Joe will re-engage in the Paris Climate Accords in a last ditch effort to curtail carbon emissions. Evolving from fossil fuels (I'm a former coal geologist) to sustainable energy sources will cut carbon emissions and create jobs to install and maintain the necessary hardware and software to make the vital transition.  It is time to remove Trump the Instigator and replace him with the Joe We Know!

Andy Klitzke  Running for A New Prosperity  I ran for the Red Wing City Council with the single goal of helping people. When I began my campaign to win your support I thought it would be about engaging as many residents as possible showing the voters that I understand the responsibility associated with representing you and proving Im serious about my commitment to public service.  That quickly changed. As I listened to residents my campaign became a crusade to help the parents who are worried that they cant provide the kind of future they want for their kids and the young people who think buying their first home is out of reach along with the seniors concerned they may not be able to live the comfortable retirement they planned. My campaign became a call to action to rescue the small business owners being squeezed by forces out of their control and to bring hope and progress to the people who are not feeling like they are equal members of our community.  I know first-hand that Red Wing families and small business owners cannot wait for meaningful budget reform. We need lower taxes and less spending that puts real dollars back our pockets. We need leaders who pursue new opportunities for growth that will kick-start our economy and new affordable housing that does not destroy our historic neighborhoods. I will get to work on them all right away in January.  I got your message on public safety. You want more not less. I will make sure our police and fire professionals have the tools and any new training they need to deal effectively with todays challenges.  I will keep on listening! The best ideas come from you and I do not want to miss out on them or on a chance to help. I will actively seek your opinions before making any decision and I will consider them all.  I will work for our vision of a future Red Wing that is less taxed and more secure with fairness mutual respect and a new prosperity that includes everyone. I plan to bring you power and choice at City Hall.  I would appreciate your vote for the chance to make life better for all our families.  Please call me at home: 651-212-6244 or email me at andyklitzke1@gmail.com. I look forward to hearing from you.,political,Facebook

My campaign has just submitted my completed questionnaire to the Chicago Sun-Times. Im sharing my responses below:  Thomas J Wilda Running for the 5th Congressional District seat in Illinois Green Party Social Worker PhD Facebook/Twitter/Instagram: @TomWilda2020 1 . Are you satisfied with the federal governments response to the COVID-19 pandemic? Why or why not? What grade would you give President Donald Trump for his handling of the pandemic and why? This pandemic was not taken seriously from the beginning. The failed response began before the pandemic hit with the reduction and near elimination of the CDC staff. Lack of equipment can be blamed on poor management and years of depending on labor camps in China to produce the equipment. President Trump failed to enact the Production Defense Act failed to abide by CDC guidelines failed to give help to the states in following CDC guidelines. We are left with the worse response to his crisis in the world the most cases the most deaths. Our country gets an F for our response. 2. What should the federal government do to stimulate economic recovery from the pandemic shutdowns? There is an immediate need for a UBI (Universal Basic Income) for every adult citizen in the country. $3000 a month is needed. For those that do not need it it can be taxed back. People need to pay rents and mortgages. Businesses that were doing well before the pandemic need to have payroll and expense support so that they will be viable after the pandemic. Medicare for all must be enacted to ensure medical coverage for citizens and payments to hospitals medical facilities and doctors. 3. In the wake of the death of George Floyd President Trump signed an executive order on police reform. It calls for the creation of a database to track police officers with multiple instances of misconduct federal grants to encourage police departments to meet higher certification standards on use of force and the greater involvement of social workers and mental health professionals when the police respond to calls dealing with homelessness mental illness and addiction. The order also calls for police departments to ban the use of chokeholds except when an officer feels his or her life is endangered. Will this be enough to address concerns about police brutality? If not what other steps should be taken? These reforms are not enough. President Trump (and it occurred with President Obama also) proudly gave assault military equipment to police departments. Police departments have developed a culture of military presence with a siege mentality. This process has been many years in the making. Police departments should be defunded and then refunded. Police officers can reapply for their position. All new police officers will be required to train in non-violent processes. Military equipment must be returned to the federal government. Police officers must be licensed with a requirement of continuing education in order to maintain their license. Civilian police boards must be enacted with the power to review suspend and terminate officers. 4. Also in the wake of the death of George Floyd the House passed the Justice in Policing Act which would ban police departments from using chokeholds develop a national standard for use of force limit the transfer of military weapons to police departments define lynching as a federal hate crime establish a national police misconduct registry and limit qualified immunity which protects officers from lawsuits over alleged misconduct. Do you support this legislation? Why or why not? What other steps if any would you like to see the federal government take on police reform? I do support this legislation. Please see my prior response for what other steps are needed for reform. 5. Whats your view on President Trumps decision to commute the sentence of Roger Stone? There are many people in prison for long sentences for possessing a very small amount of marijuana. It is not right that those that commit white collar crimes are treated better than other citizens. The president needs to commute the sentences of many people who have committed small crimes. 6. Please tell us about your civic work in the last two years whether its legislation you have sponsored or other paid or volunteer work to improve your community. The last years I have had a private practice in psychotherapy. Many of my clients have an inability to pay due to immigration status and other reasons. I have treated a good number of people pro bono. In past years I have worked with the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless; helped establish a homeless center and worked with various community groups. I am also a founding member of the Alliance for Just Money. 7. What are your views on the decision by the U.S. House to impeach President Donald Trump? Was the impeachment process fair or not? How so? If in your view the president should not have been impeached would you have supported censure? Please explain. The Democrats attempted to impeach the President on false premises. Evidence used was not genuine. The Steele dossier was a made-up document. The process was an attempt to avoid addressing the flaws in the Democratic platform as well as the support of a flawed candidate in a corrupt primary process. There are many things the President may be criminally liable for but these were not investigated. I think mostly because many politicians of both major parties are guilty of similar offenses. The process of impeachment was a sham and removed our attention from the wars we are in the out of control military budget the climate crisis and much more. 8. How would you reduce the federal budget deficit which now stands at about $1 trillion for 2020? What changes if any to the U.S. tax code do you support and why?  Firstly the budget deficit this year will be $3-4 trillion. It is this deficit that is often used as the reason we cannot have good things like Medicare for All forgiveness of student debt and free education. The deficit exists because the country relies on private banks purchasing Treasury Bonds for its money supply. There are few banks that are qualified to do this so the process is in the hands of a small number of people. In buying Treasury Bonds banks fund the government. They buy the bonds with money made from thin air but expect the money to be repaid with interest. So we have debt. When the government cannot cover its costs through taxation they sell more bonds. This process was established by The Federal Reserve system in 1913. All banks must be part of it. As part of this act private banks can create money from nothing for other purposes such as mortgages and student loans. Banks create money only through the establishment of debt. This debt under the current system can never be paid back. It does not have to be this way. Article 1 section 8 clause 5 of the US Constitution gives the federal government the right to create money without debt. My proposal would be to eliminate the Federal Reserve and the right of banks to create money with debt and create a monetary authority under the Department of the Treasury. The authority would determine the amount of money needed in the economy to provide for the common welfare and common needs. The Treasury would establish this amount and it would be budgeted by Congress. This would be clean money without debt. What about the debt that exists? It would be paid back to the banks by the Treasury over a period of years. Probably around 100. Banks would have money for their reserves and to lend for new investments and business ventures Regarding the tax code: All should be paying their fair share. The wealthiest have the first access to created money the average citizen has the last access. The last pay the most and the first pay the least. We need to change that so that the first are last and the last are first. That would be a fair tax system. 9. What changes would you like to see made to our nations healthcare system? Would you shore up the Affordable Care Act or work to repeal it in full? Whats your view on Medicare for All? And what should be done if anything to bring down the cost of prescription drugs? This is so easy. Medicare at 100% for all is the least expensive and most fair way to fund a healthcare system. Look at the rest of the developed world. The government through Medicare for all would be able to negotiate the price of drugs but medications would be paid for by a Medicare for all program. 10. Do you support or oppose DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) and why? Should a path to citizenship be created for the so-called DREAMers? Please explain. This is just simple justice. Those who came here as children and have grown up here and contribute to society have a right to stay. Anything else would be inhuman. Of course they should be able to become citizens. 11. What are the three most important issues in your district on which the federal government can and should act? In terms of the Federal Government for this district and many districts UBI with fair tax system is needed Medicare for all and a just distribution of federal dollars for human needs in the district. 12.  What is the biggest difference between you and your opponent(s)? I really dont know where my Republican opponent stands on these issues. As far as my Democratic opponent and the incumbent well I would say look at his voting record. 13. What action should Congress take if any to reduce gun violence? Military grade weaponry needs to be illegal. Other guns must be registered and owning a gun most be licensed with a requirement of yearly continuing education on gun safety. Police should be as focused on illegal gun sales as they are on drug sales. 14. Is climate change real? Is it significantly man-made? Is it a threat to humankind? What if anything should Congress and the federal government do about it? The knowledge that burning fossil fuels creates climate change was researched and confirmed by the oil companies themselves in the 1950s 70 years ago. It is not a debate in the scientific community; only the business community wants there to be a debate. We already see the effects of climate change and it will get worse. What is needed is a Green New Deal. We need to get off fossil fuels reduce consumption of energy and create jobs to protect water forests and animals our ecosystem both micro and macro. 15. What should Congress do to ensure the solvency of Social Security and Medicare? During the Reagan administration the Social Security fund was used to balance the budget. This money was taken from Social Security to make an economic policy appear better. There have been raids on Social Security ever since. There is no crisis of Social Security. Social Security is not part of the budget so cutting it would not make a difference in the deficit. The effort to reduce Social Security is totally inhumane. Social Security will be solvent if the money owed to it is paid. I am for Medicare for all. 16. What should Congress do to address the student loan crisis? Would you use the word crisis? Student debt is a crisis. It puts many from the younger generations in the position of being indentured servants. They are not able to participate fully in the economy because so much of their income goes to debt payment. Student loans should be assumed by the Federal Government and added to the deficit that will be paid overtime when we have a just clean money system. Yes this is a crisis for those who are burdened with this debt but this is also a crisis for the economy as money that pays back debt is not money that goes into the development of the economy. 17. What should our nations relationship be with Russia? We should have fair and just relationships with all nations. We should not have a belligerent oppositional relationship with any country. It is not in the interests of the American people to have such relationships only the interests of the military industrial complex. 18. Whats your view on the use of tariffs in international commerce? Has President Trump imposed tariffs properly and effectively? Please explain. President Trump uses tariffs as punishments. The industrialists have been sending jobs to places without worker protection and in the case of China to foreign labor camps for awhile. Once there is a truly fair workplace in every country there would be little need for tariff protection. We should be ensuring that workers are treated fairly both here and everywhere else and that ecological protections are in place everywhere. Once we have accomplished this tariffs will take care of themselves. 19. Does the United States have a responsibility to promote democracy in other countries? Please explain. We need to have democracy in the United States first. We know that our intelligence agencies have been undermining democracy in the rest of the world. This is not in service of the American people but in the interests of big business. We should not send military anywhere with the excuse that we are doing it to protect democracy. We are in other countries to secure wealth for the richest. 20. What should Congress do to limit the proliferation of nuclear arms? Demand that the President negotiate a nuclear arms reduction treaty with all nuclear powers with the end goal of eliminating all nuclear arms. 21. Please list all relatives on public or campaign payrolls and their jobs on those payrolls. None 22. What historical figure from Illinois other than Abraham Lincoln (because everybodys big on Abe) do you most admire or draw inspiration from? Please explain. I was inspired by Paul Simons moral and principled stances on issues. 23. Whats your favorite TV streaming or web-based show of all time. Why? I do not watch much TV but 20 years ago my wife and I liked the X Files. The portrayal of the intersection of science and intuition was interesting.,political,Facebook
" WASTEFUL SPENDING ALERT   Pennsylvania leads the nation...in corporate welfare.

UNP is all about showing you how the current political process sets up false dichotomies as a distraction all the while ensuring that our elected officials are able to dodge real answers and accountability. The current national debate over opening the economy is a great example. There is no question but that people are dying 150000 American lives at last look. People of color the elderly and the poor are disproportionately affected. Our elected officials citing the science (which dealing with a brand new virus is itself going through a normal process of discovery and thus continues to evolve) whenever it was most useful (read: convenient) shut down the economy. Which politicized the science. And closed many small businesses for good. Some big businesses too. Which threw millions of people out of work. Which disproportionately affected people of color the poor and the elderly who tend to occupy those marginal and low-skill jobs being eliminated. Increasing overall poverty and the individual poverty level of the impacted folks. And poverty is both expensive and deadly so the same people we are supposedly saving are the very people who will suffer the most from the cure. But the increased suffering through increased poverty will go under the radar and the media will move to a new narrative. Allowing the politicians in both parties to move on without suffering the deserved accountability for both messes and argue about who did more and who deserves the blame. So for the record here it is: Science is a process that works very well and excellent input. Science is guidance. Leaders are supposed to lead. Without true accountability we will keep getting the government we deserve no matter who we elect.,political,Facebook

Uninvited Guests  Weve heard this phrase thrown around quite a lot recently democratic socialism but what exactly does it mean? The short answer to this question is that it is communism replaced with the word socialism with the word democratic in front of it in an attempt to distinguish it from the c word. The simple textbook definition is public not private ownership of resources. Now to most public ownership would mean owned by all people but not so fast. In America the public sector is government which equates to government ownership.  The fundamental idea behind socialism is everyone shares in the wealth equally no matter how much they contribute. Sounds a lot like all men created equal theology doesnt it? Not quite all Americans have the same freedoms liberties and regulations supplied under the constitution but it is their choice how they live their life within those boundaries. Are we all treated equal? No we are not and that is part of the freedoms we have in our nation and a balancing act against discrimination. It is not perfect but we allow minorities and special groups certain caveats attempting to elevate equality standards (Title IX VII college scholarship programs targeted at certain categories).  Many classify our economy as capitalistic but it is actually a combination of both capitalism and socialism. We have the ability to dream up the impossible but our government does regulate certain aspects of ventures to protect the citizens (think FDA FCC SEC AMA). This combination economy allows for ambition innovation and growth. Imagine spending 10 years in college to become a doctor only to be a government employee with a fixed salary and what hospital you have to work at? Would you make the effort to finish that schooling?  Enter 2020. We have race wars and pandemics in plentiful and just for fun its an election year. What a perfect time to manipulate the masses. It happens very slowly. Initially its safer at home due to the extreme contagiousness of the virus then they force businesses to close entirely. Next after a haphazard trial reopening you are shut down again and new criteria to reopen. You meet the criteria and the bar is moved. Finally you start the reopen process and it becomes more clear of their intentions when they give Mandatory Regulations on how you live in your own home during the holidays. That is control.  Lets first clear up some incorrect assumptions about what I mean when I say Im not afraid of COVID-19:  1. I do not believe it is a hoax I believe the propaganda around it is. 2. I am not invincible and in fact I expect that at some point within the next two years I will catch the virus so I am immune to it. 3. I am not afraid of dying from it because if it my time to go God can take me as he pleases regardless of the overall low fatality rate. 4. If I were experiencing symptoms or knowingly had direct exposure I would follow all quarantine guidelines without resistance. 5. If I am destined to die from this virus I would rather die living than being consumed by fear (how many people have followed protocols to a T and still ended up with it even succumbing you it?) 6. One death from it is too many.  The here and now of our nation is not about COVID discrimination or what dumb thing a politician has said or done. These are distractions to the slow takeover of our freedom. What do I mean by this? Let me explain.  I worked from home for 2.5 months. I wear a mask in stores and restaurants (albeit not while I eat or in between bites ). I wear a mask to walk 20 steps from my desk to the copier. I stand in front of a face-recognition thermal scanner every morning before Im allowed to work. I wash my hands regularly along with the multiple bottles of sanitizer at my desk in my purse and car.  There is a line however and this has crossed that line. I will not allow the government (local or federal) to dictate how when where who or what happens inside my home. My home that I pay for pay property taxes on pay for with the salary I get from a job that pays taxes to both California and the Federal Government. The 1550 square feet of America that I own is not at their discretion to decide how I spend my days especially my holidays.  Why is all of this important? Losing freedom means losing America. You cannot compare us to socialist nations democratic or otherwise. The War of 1812 was not fought so we could be like every other nation. The diversity size and ideals of our nation cannot be replicated. Ive said many times that it is not easy being an American in fact its quite hard. Having your ideals and freedoms attacked being blamed for past indiscretions that happened long before you were alive tolerating different opinions and demonstrations of free speech. At the same time it is what makes our country as great as it is having the freedom for all of this and more. We are the most culturally diverse nation in the world and creating public ownership of our ideas will create failures far greater than our divorce rates. We all deserve our place among our 300 million citizens to act speak and think freely and individually.  Governor Newsome you did not knock on my door. I did not invite you in. So do yourself a favor and see yourself out! You can also take any politician that chooses ownership over leadership with you.  #thefactualfeline #TrumpPence2020 #BidenHarris2020 #election2020 #voteforthefuture #voteforfreedom #RecallGavin2020 #notinmyhouse #NotInMyCountry #GodBlessAmerica,political,Facebook
Just the facts! THE STOCK MARKET IS NOT THE ECONOMY!  Don't BUY THE CON!  Best Jobs President of all time?  During the last three years of the Obama administration 8.1 million jobs were created according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. During the first three years of the Trump administration only 6.6 million jobs were created.  Best economic growth ever?  Trump inherited a thriving economy. By just about any important measure the economy under Trump did not do as well as it did under Presidents Dwight Eisenhower Lyndon Johnson or Bill Clinton. The gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 2.3% in 2019 slipping from 2.9% in 2018 and 2.4% in 2017. But in 1997 1998 and 1999 GDP grew 4.5% 4.5% and 4.7% respectively. Yet even that period paled in comparison against the 1950s and 1960s. Growth between 1962 and 1966 ranged from 4.4% to 6.6%. In 1950 and 1951 it was 8.7% and 8% respectively. Meanwhile the unemployment rate reached a low of 3.5% under Trump but it dipped as low as 2.5% in 1953.  The BBC explained that Trump wasnt even doing as well as his political nemesis former President Barack Obama. For 2019 the data shows an annual average growth of 2.3% ending the year at 2.1% for the fourth quarter. This is significantly less than the 5.5% peak achieved in the second quarter of 2014 during the Obama presidency. And if you go further back there were times in the 1950s and 1960s when GDP growth was even higher. Megan Black an assistant professor of history at the London School of Economics told the network If you choose to look at the health of the economy based on GDP Mr. Trumps claims are suspect when compared to the national economic boom of the post-War years.  Tax cuts trickling down?  According to Forbes Trumps entire premise that the tax cuts are trickling down to families and sparking an economic boom is baseless. His tax cuts have not trickled down to workers theyve inflated deficits and by doing so they have put programs like Social Security and Medicare more at risk. Another Trump tax cut would threaten these programs even more.,political,Facebook

Housing Perspective - Second Foreclosure Crisis Unlikely  There is no doubt that the coronavirus pandemic was an unprecedented shock. However unlike the 2008 financial crisis housing was a bystander as external forces disrupted the macro environment rather than a culprit in building up systemic fundamental imbalances in the financial system. That is an important distinction when it comes to the question of both foreclosures and home prices. Would-be homebuyers who are waiting for a surge in foreclosures and for prices to plunge are likely to find themselves facing even higher prices next year. To add potential insult to injury many forecasts suggest that homebuyers will be facing higher interest rates after the crisis as well. There are many reasons why its not 2008 all over again. First the economic impacts were largely concentrated in retail stores bars restaurants and hotels while workers in high-wage sectors were relatively insulated. This group of high-wage workers not only remained employed at a much higher rate but they had a renewed passion for homeownership because of the nature of the crisis increased flexibility due to remote working and the lowest mortgage rates ever recorded. Housing demand which typically outstrips supply in California became even more ferocious and solid price growth before and during COVID-19 has created a market where 98.9% of homeowners in California have home equity. However the economy also had much better fundamentals coming into the crisis. This was a huge shock but one happening to what was otherwise a relatively healthy economy. Homebuyers since the Great Recession have tended to have higher levels of income above-average credit scores and much larger down payments. In addition the amount of home equity that homeowners liquidated to spend on cars boats RVs and vacations was a fraction of what it was back in 2006 even though prices are much higher than they were back then. This all adds up to a much smaller amount of systemic risk than there was present in the economy in 2008. And better fundamentals have already kept California more resilient. Delinquencies peaked last year at 6.8% and have been falling for the past 4 quarters consecutivelyfar below the 2009 peak of 11.3%. In addition the statistics from the federal forbearance program suggest several encouraging conclusions. Last year nearly 8.5% of mortgages were in forbearance. Now that number is just 3%. According to the exits over 40% never missed any payments missed some but already paid them all back or have since paid their loan off in full. Another 40% have come to a resolution with their banks who seem to be taking more of a were all in this together approach this time around. Taking all of this into consideration it suggests that the number of potential foreclosures in the 20000-30000 range on the high side. This pales to the 1.125 million foreclosures started between 2008 and 2010. Even if every delinquent loan went belly-up at one time there were 350000 delinquent loans in California thats still  the number that were foreclosed on last time. This isnt to say that every homeowner will be able to stay in their home or that every investor will decide to remain in business. Some folks have faced serious financial distress dont have a lot of home equity and will eventually foreclose. However the number of folks this is likely to happen to is a fraction of what it was last time. As such would-be homebuyers may not get the flood of inventory or the drop in prices that theyre waiting for.

Every day we have the pleasure of having a president who is an adult who is experienced in managing the government and who has compassion for people. The era of the daily counterpunch and the hourly lie is behind us. For now.  Are we entertaining the notion that the four-year ordeal could not possibly happen to us again? Are we letting our intensity and our advanced political skills atrophy? Can we get focused every week on what must be done on both the policy and political side? As important can we take full advantage of the relationship between the two making sure independent voters understand what Joe Biden is doing to battle the virus and restore the economy?

"This government is so incompetent. After 20 years of war and the death of our men and women in arms we left Afghanistan. This added over two trillion dollars of debt to the economy. This was the longest war in US history. I agree that we should not get into endless wars. But leaving the way we did will pave the way for the Taliban to take over the country in a matter of months at most. After 20 years we should have made a deal with them with some fundamental agreements. Thousands of innocent Afghanis will be slaughtered particularly those on the side of the Afghani government who worked with the Americans. The Afghan army is no match for the Taliban ! Now the Chinese have already stepped in with a ""helping hand"" and are making good with the the Taliban delegation who went to China. The US Secretary of State the brilliant Antony Blinken has said that ""China's possible involvement in Afghanistan could be "" a positive thing "". He said this after Taliban representatives visited China. He urged the Taliban to come to the ""negotiating table.....peacefully"". This is the mentality of this government and this Secretary of State. The Taliban have already increased their violence and taken over large parts of the country. I have no words to describe the incompetence and the total inept leadership of this country. ""FAILURE"" is written on every level of governing inside and outside the country. What a shame ! heart breaking and mind boggling ! America needs divine intervention to save it !",political,Facebook
"A prepared statement by the candidate:  Good Morning my Fellow Minnesotans  Today I would like to speak on small businesses Unions and political campaigns of today's day and age.  Unions are a vital part of this country and the community. Talk to every proud union member they will tell you what the union does for them. Unions ensure that companies treat their employees fairly that the employees are fairly compensated they provide resources to employees and their families when needed and they ensure that employees laid off must be re-employed by the company. Unions stimulate economy by ensuring fair wages and this also helps keep employees from relying on government programs. Unions have gotten a bad reputation we have all heard at least one story where someone was protected by their union when they should have been fired or that they breed laziness. All I can say is that without the Union 9/11 would have worse on my family. My Mom was a union member this may make me a bit bias because I grew up knowing her union friends. On September 24th 2001 without warning My Mom went to work at NWA and was told she was no longer employed with the company; she was being laid off. This didn't just happened to her 2500 employees of Northwest Airlines' Minnesota operation were given the same news. The office's department boss on September 11th 2001 told everyone present that nobody was going to be laid off. Speaking for the company her department boss stated that the company was confident that 9/11 while tragic was not going to hurt any of the office employees. On the 24th it was exposed to be the lie that it was. My Mom's tenacity landed her in front of the late Senator Ted Kennedy who was the chairman of the HELP committee. My Brother was diagnosed with cancer at the age of 4 years old and was a patient at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis Tennessee. With my Brother and I's pre-existing health conditions as well as Mom's insurance financially impossible. Thankfully we lived with my Grandparents and they helped shoulder some of the burden while Mom gave my Brother and I a voice in congress. The Union helped Mom get her job back with insurance that covered all of us. Anybody who has been out of work knows how expensive COBRA is and knows the financial impossibility of being able to afford it. Without my Grandparents and the Union my Brother and I would have been placed in foster care because my Mom through no fault of her own found herself unemployed due to a terrorist attack. Unions may get a bad reputation but in circumstances like 9/11 they are without question very valuable. One final example of how unions are vital to stimulating our economy is NWA's AMFA contract. An employee who stayed a cleaner for 5 years back in 1999 would have received a little over $18 an hour this is in contrast to the national average of $14.02 reported in 2000. These figures come from page 401 of the 2008 edition of the US Commerce's Statistical Abstract of the United States.  Like Unions small businesses are vital to our local economies. Small businesses employ local workers and often times have more understanding and compassion for their employees' unique circumstances. These business get taxed astronomically and in some cases the taxation causes them to shut down in the lean years. My Grandparents owned a business from 1974 until 1992. The business was started as a blacksmith in 1892 by my 2x great grandfather Michael J. Corcoran who later moved the business into downtown Rosemount in 1916. The business would pass hands twice until it reached my grandparents Dick and Pody Corcoran. Employing 10-15 residents of the community they were one of many businesses that were responsible for employing roughly 90% of Rosemount's residents. A string of bad city council decisions from roughly 1980 into the 90's saw many of Rosemount's small business quietly close their doors seemingly overnight. The decisions made by the City Council hurt the small ""Mom and Pop"" businesses and practically ensured their inability to thrive. My Grandparent's weathered these decisions despite having the cards stacked against them from the start. Many of the businesses were offered to move by other cities who saw the value they would provide their communities. Some of these businesses could afford to move while others would have the money to move only after selling both their inventory and the building they owned. My Grandparents along with a couple other family businesses decided to stay despite the offers they had received. Each business that stayed had a myriad of reasons for doing so. My Grandparents in part stayed because they felt they were a valued business; a feeling that the city council took every opportunity not to reciprocate despite the feelings of Rosemount's citizens. In '92 as a final act of hostility the city council denied my Grandparents the right to gift to the Catholic Church the land they owned where the original store had stood. The city council deemed the land to be too valuable and would not allow any gifting to occur. From 1916 until 1986 the old store stood as a shiny white beacon to the travelers heading north on Dodd through Rosemount. In 1986 the building was deemed to be too much trouble and it was agreed that it should be demolished. The city council didn't help that matter by constantly dragging my Grandparent's in to talk about a spring that was purported to lay under the old building. To our knowledge they never found such a spring. From the beginning my Grandparents weathered the storms that came with inheriting a financially failing business. Grandpa and Grandma took this financially failing business and turned it into one that generated close to a million dollars each year. Grandpa prior to taking over his family business taught the Dale Carnegie's business courses. After he took over the business Grandpa joined the 500 million dollar club in lawn and garden besides being named the top salesman in the tristate area in the same category. My Grandparents were proud to serve the citizens of Rosemount. The downside to owning a small business was not lost on Dick and Pody and they knew all too well the struggles of keeping a business going; this of course came with its owns costs. I am friend to small businesses because I do believe they are valuable to a city's local economy and help ease the unemployment rate at the local level. While big businesses have their place the quality of services and product often cannot compare to that from a small business; most small businesses take pride in the service and product quality that they provide. Due to the fact that small businesses are not as wealthy as the big box stores they instead have to rely on their reputation for quality workmanship and/or services. Small businesses get taxed as if they are wealthy but wealthy businesses don't get taxed the amount that they should. Companies like Walmart and Amazon contribute to the number of employees on government programs. While they may fix the employment problem they contribute to the continued need for welfare. Small businesses provide their employees a quality of life and a sense of purpose that big businesses are unable to offer with their heartless policies and cutthroat sales tactics. Often these employers drive out small businesses because they can pay more in taxes than a small business can. City Governments often care more about the profit they can make over the quality of life of their citizens. Small businesses have been studied in other countries and it was found that the quality of life was marked higher than those who worked in big businesses. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics small businesses are able to provide a wider range of benefits than big businesses with paid holidays vacation sick time retirement benefits and insurance being among the most offered benefits for small businesses. We must protect the working class with Unions and by allowing small businesses to grow and flourish. So now let's talk about the ways politicians get you to vote for them and why my campaign is different.  We have heard them every election year politicians running their smear campaigns against their opponents. While annoying to many of us by the time November rolls around these ads are actually quite effective. These ads do help people lean towards one candidate or another. These politicians are trained on what they have to promise in order to be elected. Every time you watch one of those ads you can be assured that someone was behind it all pulling the strings. Campaigns launch less than honest means to get votes don't believe me search for campaign management on Youtube sometime. They use children family or fears in their ads to get you to vote and the scary part these tactics psychologically get you to vote for or against a candidate. To win public office yes you must compete with others however unlike most races the ethical rules for candidates largely involve finances and the dissemination of dishonest or outright false material. I am on record with stating that I believe these campaign methods while effective not only are dishonorable but cheapen the office for which the politician is running for. I will answer any attack made upon me by a fellow candidate and I will do it with honesty and integrity. To do anything less is not only shameful conduct but and this is my belief should disqualify a politician from ever holding a public office. There was a time in this country where we believed in ethically campaigning for office. What a person did in their bedroom or in their private lives was off limits because it had nothing to do with the office they were running for. Somewhere along the way our country started to favor a more gladiatorial spectacle than that of honesty and integrity. Politicians being the gladiators and the public being the emperor; remember thumbs up the gladiator lived down they died. You have heard it said that an honest person cannot be elected to office but how we wish we could go back to that. Every year we hear politicians make campaign promises that they never deliver on. They know that if they make enough promises that sound great you will likely elect them. When they fail they don't take responsibility rather they shove it off onto somebody else. If I make a promise that I cannot keep because of mitigating factors I will ensure that I take responsibility for the promise and that I explain why I was not able to deliver on it. The values of honesty and integrity do still matter and we must hold politicians accountable who use less than honest means to charm you into voting for them. So how is my campaign different. First I am not made of money and so the likelihood of seeing a political campaign commercial paid for by me is very slim. I would rather people donate their time or contribute by telling others about my campaign. If I feel that a campaign account needs to be set up I will alert donors to this fact. I will run an honest and ethical campaign I am not going to lower myself to the level of those who oppose me the office of the Governor must be above that. If I am to be elected it will be on the content of my character my honesty and my will to do good for this state. I want to be a governor in the people's heart not psychologically maneuver them to vote for me.  This may lead to the question of how then am I qualified to lead this state? if you want experience in public office you'll find none. The experience that I have is in dealing with the public and listening to the experiences of those who are older than myself. I have worked with the public for 15+ years and been paid for only 6 of those years. I have volunteered for the American Legion at their brat and hot dog stand raising funds for ""Veterans on the lake."" This organization takes both able bodied and disabled veterans as well as active duty military their family and friends and allows them to have a fishing vacation away from the problems of civilization. I volunteered 10+ years with the American Legion and I am proud to call those tenacious veterans my friends. Most are veterans of Vietnam and Korea servicemen and women that were largely unappreciated when they came home from fighting overseas. The biggest thing that I believe makes me qualified for public office is my willingness to make things better for the State. How many times have you applied for a job and have been told to reapply when you have more experience? I call these the ""Thank you but no thank you"" letters. How can one gain experience if nobody is willing to let them get their foot in the door. No I didn't plan on making a career of politics but in light of all the recent events I feel it is time a citizen not a politician takes the oath of office and begins to work with our citizens to accomplish a better Minnesota. The shootings the riots the attack on the US Capitol and everything else that has happened has reminded me of this question posed in the movie Lincoln: ""Do you think we choose to be born? Or are we fitted to the times we are born into?."" Out of all the candidates that are running for the same office as I am all of them have held public office and therefore may be seen as more qualified than I am. However if we continue to complain but do nothing to change it we will continue to elect the same politicians we claim to despise. I feel that I have been fitted to the times into which I was born. I don't have to be the most qualified person in America I just have to be the most qualified out of those running for office. Honestly I have to be more qualified than the same tired politicians that we have elected time and time again. Only you can make that decision though. If you truly want the government that Lincoln spoke of in his Gettysburg address that Government of the people by the people and for the people then I ask that you stray away from the traditional candidates and take your chance on me. I can't let you down because if I do I not only let you down but I let my family friends and future generations down. How could I face my children as a failure. I will hold myself accountable to the people who have elected me and not to the party that nominated me. In the end the nomination doesn't matter it is the voters that take their chance on me the ones that place their trust and faith in me; those are who matter and those are the people that I must work for!  Good Morning to all of you on this beautiful Friday I thank all of you for doing your job today because I know many of you have very thankless jobs. You are appreciated by me and always will be. You make this State the best in the Union and make our Country a better place to live. Keep up the great work!",political,Facebook
"A lot to write about tonight. Mostly about the rec facility public hearing but some other substantive topics as well:  * We had an assortment of minor development changes - some rezoning in the country for rural housing fixing some mistakes in a previous development regarding lot setbacks splitting out a new lot in town so an additional dwelling could be built etc.  * The airport continues to smash records -- at a pace of more than 36000 passengers a year -- and we are moving quickly to build more parking. 77 new spaces are almost done and with the contractor already in place we negotiated a great deal to add another 22 right away. City council members suffer through this growth as well. I nearly had to park on Airport Rd the last time I was there.  * Archway had record revenues in April and May this year.  * Compute North the company with a data center at the tech park generated over $100k in revenues for the city from its operations this last month. Its small footprint and relatively light strain on our job market is yielding great things for our city. We are very appreciative of them and for NPPD on making this development possible.  * Finally we held a public hearing about the idea of building a new city sports complex. The question to consider boiled down was to allow voters to decide on Dec 14 whether to continue the expiring 1% restaurant tax to pay for a portion of this facility.  If you want to read the packet we had for the discussion which includes a couple pages of bullet points at the end click here:  I will skip to the punchline to say that the council voted 4-0 (with one member absent) to give City of Kearney voters the question of deciding whether to build this facility and continue the restaurant tax to pay for a portion of it. The election will be December 14.  Here are the important details:  * Uses of the facility are somewhat fluid which we discussed in the meeting but generally speaking we are looking at: 1) a 70k square ft indoor turf field ostensibly for soccer or for really for anything you can image; 2) As many as 8 basketball courts which convert to 12 volleyball courts; 3) 4 pickleball courts; 4) an elevated running/walking track with curves that allow for fast running/sprints and are within regulation for indoor tracks although it couldn't be used for official college track meets  * It would be over 200k square feet total and we are capping costs for the public question at $34 million  * It would be built on Talmadge St west of the new convention center (location is critical for state funding)  * Its intent would be as a premier destination for adult and youth sporting competitions which are already a major economic development driver for Kearney. It is hard to see unless you are down in the hotel areas on a weekend but adult and youth travel sports are creating a ton of Kearney jobs and paying for a lot of our taxes.  * It would also be accessible to the general public for park & recreation activities and other uses/drop-ins.  Why is this a good idea?  * I cannot overstate the fact that tourism is critical to the quality of life we have here. More and more things are going east and if we aren't leading and growing we are shrinking and losing. We must maintain our edge in this critical are of our economy.  * We have very very tight usage now for the various gym facilities around the community. Lots of late nights and challenging time slots for individuals kids and teams to work around school schedules to get on school gymnasiums some of which are undersized.  * We have a literal once in a generation opportunity to pay to build this facility - The state has a law that allows any new economic development within 600 yards of a sports complex like this to contribute all sales taxes towards the building cost... up to 50% of the cost. These sales taxes would otherwise just go to Lincoln to the state general fund. There may be no other time that a facility like this could be stationed next to an economic driver like the new convention center in order to yield such a significant amount of money. - The restaurant tax is expiring from paying off Patriot Park. Out of town residents pay approximately half of that we think. We can continue that 1% tax to cover the other half of the costs leaving Kearney taxpayers basically covering 1/4 of the cost a building like this. - With recreation space already tight in Kearney there is a real scenario where the city would need to develop some new gym space anyway. For the same amount of local tax money we can build something that gets the job done or we can leverage the state and tourism dollars and build something that will make Kearney a state regional and national destination -- and that isn't hyperbole. There are already several national sports associations communicating with Kearney about coming with national tournaments if this is built.  * However governments often talk about building something but don't confront the need to operate it. That is where hidden costs are and taxpayers are left footing the bill for years to come. Again we have once in a generation scenario to address this: - The Kearney Visitors Bureau just ended its subsidy of the Class Car Museum -- this was approximately $300000 a year. As a member of that board I felt that while the car museum was an amazing facility the ROI on that amount of funds wasn't there. Now the visitors bureau can take those funds which are generated by hotel stays and cover a portion of the operating costs for a facility that will bring 10s of thousands of people to Kearney each year. - A private donor has agreed to give $50000 a year towards operations. - Projected revenues from sports events are over half a million dollars ever year and close the gap on operating costs leaving no need to increase taxes on any local residents to operate it. - Admittedly this is where there is some uncertainty but I have quizzed staff visitors bureau and sports associations in Kearney repeatedly about these projections and most feel that the revenue projections are actually conservative.  * So what else is happening that makes this a good project? - Thanks to federal CARES money Talmadge street was already in the process of being paved all the way to Yanney Park giving two clean entrances to the facility. - Thanks to the car museum sale the visitors bureau is also giving $1 million to an endowment that will grow to cover upgrades and maintenance for the facility. - Younes Hospitality has agreed to provide exterior maintenance for the facility at no charge. - The land for the site will be donated  Based on the conservative projections no new taxes or costs for City of Kearney residents will have to be levied to build the largest indoor sports complex like this from what I understand in the State of Nebraska. Let that sink in.  One other thing that is driving me relates to casinos. A recent newspaper article had Fonner Park in Grand Island complaining about all the casino plans in motion in Nebraska. Communities throughout our state are considering building casinos -- I can think of eight off the top of my head. Some people think casinos are the way to drive economic development for Nebraska. I'm not against people choosing to frequent them but I think the impact will be diluted and I would rather we drive economic development in a different way in Kearney. However if we can't do something on this scale in a sports facility I truly believe there will be a serious push to put a casino in Kearney too. Whether that is good or bad is a personal opinion but a center for adult and youth sports is the kind of statement I think we should make.  Lastly in addition to the public meeting I did hear from a number of people the last two weeks. The vast majority were positive. However every project like this has good questions and concerns that come up and I thought I would list some of the things I'm hearing from people -- not all these questions came from people who are straight up against the project but are just unsure right now and that is fair.  * Restaurant tax - I'll paraphrase comments - ""I thought that was supposed to expire. You told us that it would go away but I knew that it wouldn't."" -- I do understand the cynicism about taxes and there is no doubt that City of Kearney residents could choose to stop the tax (about $1.1m collected per year about half comes from local residents). However the tax IS ending just like we said and it will only continue if residents choose to do that. The council can only put it on the ballot. I think based on the return on investment it is wise for us to continue it but I only get one vote out of thousands in making that decision. To be clear just because a tax gets 51% doesn't make the tax by nature a good tax. My main check as a council member is whether the tax to be voted on by the people has a clear use has a clear completion date and doesn't lead to other future hidden costs. This tax meets all those things for me and so I think it is justifiable for citizens to vote whether to continue it.  * ""We need to spend money on different things like roads"" -- I 110% agree about building roads. We are literally building roads as fast as we can. We cannot physically build anymore due to # of contractors. Also this money is not fungible. Every facet of the funds to be used would be for this project/tourism/etc. We aren't depriving our budget of anything else that a city needs to be doing. If it isn't spent on this it either will just go to the state or will go towards other tourism projects.  * ""What about other uses for the facility?"" - again good question. There are other potential sports uses -- skateboarding competitions swimming ice hockey to name a few. The plans are somewhat fluid but also each of those uses would be a significant cost increase. I think the best thing was said but Randy Buschkoetter tonight. This project lays the groundwork for other things to be added more cheaply and easily in the future should people decide to do that. Can only do so much now with the budget we can afford even as high as it is. But this is a step closer to any one of those things.  * ""Not a good city purpose / should be private"" -- Also a good point and generally I would agree for large venues. The city does need more indoor facilities for recreation which we could do more cheaply and fill the basic need. However we probably couldn't fill those basic needs any more cheaply than what city taxpayers would have to pay for this great facility. In addition the incentives and the way the state set up their sales tax turnback program this is really only happening with the city doing it or else it's not happening.  * ""You say that the public will have access but we've heard that before."" -- This one stings a little because it is about trust. All I can say is to turn your eyes on the track record of the City of Kearney. Whether it is spreading splash pads throughout the community giving many user groups access to Patriot Park including the schools creating the Kearney Community Olympics etc. etc. the city has a track record in recreation of not just catering to traveling teams and elite sports but keeping the average citizen in mind. This will be a facility used for competitive sports and tournaments no doubt and there may be weekends where it is tough for the general public to access all of it but we are committed to giving public access and expect citizens to hold us accountable for that promise.  Ultimately this is in the hands of citizens now. Citizens brought the idea forward and the council thought it was wise to open the question to the city at large. But if it passes it won't be because any of the five council members lobbied for it. It will be because community groups speak to their friends family and neighbors.",political,Facebook
Inflation rose AGAIN in July (5.4%). This is the highest rate of inflation since right before the 2008 financial crisis. Americans are paying more for food housing vehicles and just about everything else.

Jeff its about water.  Thats what I love about mayors - they always cut to the chase.  People tell you what they want. Mayors tell you what theyve *gotta* have.  We just finished eight town halls in counties east of I-95 and we heard a clear theme from the mayors who joined us: water sewer and broadband.  Yes roads yes bridges - but water sewer and broadband. Theyre overlooked because theyre underground but theyre crucial to creating so many other opportunities.  You can lump them together and call them subsurface infrastructure but its really about laying an economic foundation. And if youre missing one piece youre not going to build much on top of it.  Example: People talk about the lack of affordable rental options. Then the mayor says We cant build an apartment complex on a well and a septic tank. Gotta have water and sewer. Thats whats holding us back.  Then someone asks How can we keep young people from leaving? Before I can answer a mayor says Cant keep em here without broadband. Just not possible. Gotta have it.  These things are expensive and lots of our rural counties dont have the tax base to really build out water and sewer on their own. They need state and federal partners to do it.  But heres the thing: We spent $2 trillion in Afghanistan. And the vast majority of that was unnecessary.  If just 0.5% of those funds had found their way to the rural counties east of I-95 (or west of Asheville for that matter) youd have a brand new economic foundation across the entire region. Water sewer and broadband would be strong enough to support all kinds of business growth from entrepreneurs to major industries.  Youd be looking at a dramatic upgrade in the economy of the region. Lives would be much better and probably longer.  And thats roughly the amount that were slated to get as a state if the bipartisan infrastructure bill passes. But heres the thing: Its going to be spread across the whole state.  (Incidentally all three of our states GOP Senate candidates said they would have voted against it - because its too big of an investment.)  Bottom-line: If this infrastructure bill passes were going to be able to make large investments in our state. Thats a good thing and its going to mean a lot for a lot of people. But were still going to have major unmet infrastructure needs particularly in rural counties. Finding ways to help those counties invest in their economic foundations is going to remain a priority.  And that means mayors need to keep telling senators what they need and we need senators who will listen.  - Jeff Jackson,political,Facebook
2/3/2021 OSHA Issues Improved COVID Prevention Guidance  PPE personal protective equipment for industry  Email sharing button LinkedIn sharing button Facebook sharing button Twitter sharing button  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has issued stronger worker safety guidance to help employers and workers implement a coronavirus prevention program and better identify risks that could lead to exposure and contraction according to a press release from the U.S. Department of Labor.  Protecting Workers: Guidance on Mitigating and Preventing the Spread of COVID-19 in the Workplace provides updated guidance and recommendations and outlines existing safety and health standards. OSHA is providing recommendations to assist employers in providing a safe and healthful workplace.  Over 400000 Americans have died from COVID-19 and millions of people are out of work because of this crisis. Employers and workers can help our nation fight and overcome this deadly pandemic by committing themselves to make their workplaces as safe as possible said Senior Counselor to the Secretary of Labor M. Patricia Smith in a press release from OSHA. The recommendations in OSHAs updated guidance will help us defeat the virus strengthen our economy and bring an end to the staggering human and economic toll the coronavirus has taken on our nation.  Implementing a coronavirus prevention program is the most effective way to reduce the spread of the virus according to OSHA. The guidance announced recommends several essential elements in a prevention program:  - Conducting a hazard assessment  - Identifying control measures to limit the spread of the virus  - Adopting policies for employee absences that dont punish workers to encourage potentially infected workers to remain home  - Ensuring that coronavirus policies and procedures are communicated to both English and non-English-speaking workers  - Implementing protection from retaliation for workers who raise coronavirus-related concerns.  OSHA is updating its guidance to reduce the risk of transmission of the coronavirus and improve worker protections so businesses can operate safely and employees can stay safe and working said Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Occupational Safety and Health Jim Frederick according to the press release.  The guidance details key measures for limiting coronaviruss spread including ensuring infected or potentially infected people are not in the workplace implementing and following physical distancing protocols and using surgical masks or cloth face coverings. It also provides guidance on the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) improving ventilation good hygiene and routine cleaning.  OSHA will update guidance as developments in science best practices and standards warrant.

When my children were young I had to close my small business and stop working for a number of years because the costs of childcare actually made it too expensive to work. It's an absurd situation faced by far too many parents.  Forcing people to leave the workforce is bad for the economy and for workers who end up with gaps in their resumes simply for taking care of their kids. A universal paid family leave policy leave would create a better environment for businesses parents and children.,political,Facebook
It is a great honor to be a newcomer with fresh ideas someone with local government experience and always looking to #InvestinOxnardsFuture. If you havent already please read the authors introduction to the race and my responses to the Ventura County Stars questions below.  Election 2020: A rematch in Oxnard City Council District 3 By Wendy Leung [Published 10:13 a.m. PT Oct. 2 2020]  Four years ago Councilman Oscar Madrigal won a seat on the Oxnard City Council beating out Aaron Starr by about 600 votes.  This November they meet again but this time it's under a new district-based voting system.  In 2016 Madrigal Starr and nine other candidates competed for two at-large council seats. This time the two are joined by newcomer Ronald Arruejo in a race to represent District 3 which is northeast of the city and east of Oxnard Boulevard.  It's Arruejo's first time running for office but Madrigal and Starr have both been on the ballot many times before. Madrigal ran three times for City Council before winning in 2016. Starr ran twice for council and twice for mayor.  Ronald Arruejo  Age: 30  Occupation: Financial management analyst  Education: Bachelor of Arts from UCLA political science and Scandinavian languages and cultures; Master of Public Affairs from Indiana University Bloomington local government management and public finance administration  Years in office: n/a  Q: If Oxnard voters in November pass Measure E the 1.5-cent sales tax increase will contribute approximately $40 million to the budget. What should it be spent on? A: Roadway repair. When I talk to voters in District 3 roadway repair is invariably the most common refrain from them. Since the approval of Measure O funds in 2008 the City Council has managed the utilization of these monies yet based on a 2019 report on FY18 departmental expenditures street maintenance and repairs only makes up 13% of the total. It is clearly not a priority if only $1 of every $8 is spent on that and I am willing to fight to make sure that it is of a higher importance with Measure E funds.  Q: Many Oxnard residents including the farmworker community are struggling during COVID-19 with no work or reduced work hours and high housing costs. Does the city have a role in helping them? A: Yes. The farmworker community is an integral part of our municipal and regional economy. The city could have financially partnered with the county when it was offering the Ventura County Pandemic Rental Assistance program. Additionally the citys dissemination of the program could have been more widespread and robust but it was certainly correct nonetheless. Oxnard needs to be impressing upon the county state and federal levels more aggressively for funding these essential workers who are the first step to putting food on our plates.  Q: Across the country and in Oxnard some have called for defunding the police department and using the money for other services. Should Oxnard consider spending less on police or should it actually restore the cuts made through the years? A: We should be ensuring that the police are not overburdened with solving every problem. Their priority is on public safety and if appropriate they should be able to transfer that responsibility to more relevant services. For example once the police responds to a call involving children Child Welfare Services should get involved as soon as possible. With a future diminished economy due to COVID-19 establishing networks that better utilize the services already present with dedicated teams and support from all levels of government would be one way to prevent spending more money while increasing the effectiveness of all involved departments. ...

Today the House voted again on the Pelosi Payoff legislation  a $1.9 trillion spending package that does not meet the goal of crushing the virus and reopening our economy.  My opinion has not changed since the House voted on this bill two weeks ago. I cannot support this needless spending. COVID relief is not an excuse to write the Biden Administration a blank check.  While the Senate made some necessary changes nothing was done to remove the wasteful unrelated spending in the bill. No efforts were made to make this a bipartisan bill  in fact Democrats have joined Republicans to vote against this bill on both occasions in the House.,political,Facebook
"Facts are important so it's tough to see people say that 'Maine doesn't benefit' from the Clean Energy Corridor. That's simply not true.  Apologies for the long post but the fact is: Maine benefits in quite a few ways starting with receiving some of the clean electricity that will come through the Corridor.  Last July Governor Mills negotiated with Hydro Quebec to buy some of that clean electricity for Maine too. It'll be enough to power 70000 homes or 10000 businesses and at a discounted rate. For example Massachusetts consumers will get this electricity for 6 cents per kilowatt-hour but Maine consumers will get it for 2.5 cents per kilowatt-hour.  Beyond that...  Towns that host a part of the corridor are expected receive increased tax revenue of $18 million. The City of Lewiston alone will get $7 million in new tax revenue the first year because of the substation. That's more than the Walmart distribution center added. Lewiston city officials are over the moon about it. One called it a ""life-saver for the city.""  Decreased co2 emissions will be the equivalent of 750000 fewer cars on the road in the region.  CMP is going to put another $200 million into upgrading Maine's electrical grid to make it more reliable and help it accept more renewables.  The project creates a $15 million fund to help Mainers install energy-efficient heat pumps.  With more stable energy supply coming into the grid Mainers will see fewer spikes in seasonal rates.  The project will invest $15 million in rural broadband internet access for Western Maine plus providing some of the infrastructure to allow the fiber-optic cable to be run.  Maine snowmobilers will get another 50 miles of straightaways and wood mats used during construction will be donated to snowmobile clubs to be used as bridges.  The project will invest $15 million to help Maine expand its infrastructure for electric vehicles. More places to plug in.  The project will proactively invest $140 million in lowering CMP customers' energy bills. Plus $50 million in rate-relief specifically for low-income consumers.  The project is giving the state $6 million in funding for a variety of educational purposes.  The project is investing $6 million in Maine's land-conservation fund which is run by the Nature Conservancy. Plus the 40000 acres that the project will preserve on its own.  The new electricity that comes through will lower rates for Maine consumers to a combined tune of somewhere between $14 million and $44 million a year.  Seven small timber mills from Maine were awarded $20 million in contracts to make mats... which is great from the logging industry in that part of the state.  The Passamaquoddy Tribe will receive $2.5 million in benefits.  The project will invest $10.5 million in economic development and tourism for Maine.  Plus of course the 1600 jobs that will be created during construction for which Mainers will be given preference. So far 360 of the 470 people hired for the project are from Maine which is great. 77 percent!  All told the project will add $573 million to Maine's economy not including the incidental impacts like the spending by workers at stores in host communities.",political,Facebook
"CLIMATE URGENCY:  The most pressing environmental concern for Maine is the impact of global warming and the climate crisis our planet is facing in the near future. Rising global temperatures are going to impact our environment and economy in many ways. We are on the precipice of whether we can scale back the impact of humanity on the planet's climate and we must act IMMEDIATELY if we are to prevent catastrophic global climate change.  The impact of climate change on Maine cannot be overstated. Soil erosion will make a hugely devastating impact on our state if global temperatures rise. We will see more major storms and high-level hurricanes -- stronger storms and more frequent. Billions of dollars worth of property will be destroyed in the coming decades; significant areas of our current coastline will erode and become part of the ocean.  Everything will be affected by climate change not only the natural environment but human constructs and social structures including the economy.  The philosophy that holds the environment and the economy to be in conflict with each other is a misguided farce. It is only major corporations with very specific self-serving interests who posit that the economy and environment are in conflict with each other.  The health of the environment is directly related to the economy especially here in Maine where the super-majority of our state's revenue is directly related to ecological tourism and environmentally based industries.  It is our national and state parks lakes oceans woods and mountains that stimulate the economy here -- by attracting people to fish hunt hike bird watch snowmobile ski swim boat; by providing a bounty of natural resources to support agricultural and forest industries that yield paper products blueberries potatoes fisheries and more.  Without a healthy environment in Maine we have nothing to subside on.  Therefore ultimately there are two immediately pressing environmental concerns that are tied together: climate change and the capacity of human culture to adapt (and adapt QUICKLY) to address the infrastructural transformations needed to meet the challenge of climate change.  While it may be obvious that climate change is the single most environmental issue affecting Maine the deeper question is ""Do we have the capacity to change society to address the issue?""  The solutions are all readily available. Science has given us a multitude of solutions to immediately combat climate change. The only thing holding back is the political will to start TODAY to implement the solutions we know can reverse our current climate trajectory. The biggest obstacle is political will. Time and time again the major political parties have proven that they do not have the foresight or ability to take initiative swiftly enough to make a difference before it is too late.

Governor Cooper released his proposed budget for the next two years. This proposal presents an extraordinary opportunity to invest in a pandemic recovery that will benefit all corners and people of our state. It helps schools and children increases access to healthcare enhances protection for clean air and water invests in clean energy and invests massively in infrastructure. All of this will bring many new good jobs to NC. It would also almost double our state's savings. Here are some highlights (the link below is to the budget slides with more detail):  Education  Provides K-12 teachers 10% raises on average over the biennium and ensures all noncertified school personnel receive a minimum of $15/hour.  Invests more than $78 million in early education and child development.  Provides $80 million to help school districts hire more nurses counselors psychologists and social workers to support student physical and mental health.  Jobs and Infrastructure  Leverages available state funds as well as the states share of funds from the federal American Rescue Plan Act (ARP) which is expected to provide North Carolina over $15 billion in aid.  Invests to help small businesses thrive and provides funding to prepare rural and economically distressed communities for an innovation-based economy.  Proposes funding to address the disproportionate economic impact of COVID-19 on communities of color through increased support for minority-owned businesses.  Takes advantage of the states low debt and historically low interest rates and recommends placing a $4.7 billion General Obligation Bond on the November 2021 ballot to ask voters to address key infrastructure needs  Access to quality healthcare. It is time to expand Medicaid.  Expands Medicaid to provide access to health care for more than 600000 working North Carolinians keeping rural hospitals open and strong reducing the number of uninsured veterans helping fight the opioid epidemic and injecting over $5 billion in direct investment into the state by expanding Medicaid.  The American Rescue Plan provides an additional $1.7 billion in federal funds to support Medicaid expansion without the state covering any cost share for up to six years.  Clean Energy and a clean environment.  Invests over $100 million in expanding access to clean energy technologies investing in clean energy economic development and building the clean energy workforce pipeline to catalyze North Carolinas economy. Invests $10 million for clean energy economic development and $4.5 million in clean energy grants for homegrown start-ups and small businesses.  Clean safe water and air are essential for the health and well-being of North Carolinians. Includes more than $3.8 million each year for emerging compounds mitigation.  A safer more equitable North Carolina.  The COVID-19 pandemic continues to shine a light on long-standing inequities. This budget advances equity in our healthcare economic criminal justice and education systems allowing fair opportunities to share in our states recovery and success.

Reverse Course  The Captain of the ship in the American wheelhouse needs to call out Reverse Course or else the United States is heading closer and closer to the drop of an economic waterfall to which much damage will be inflicted.  The combination of an unsustainable $30 Trillion in debt and a soon to be $4 Trillion more plus a manufacturing base that has all but been hollowed out and sold to China is spelling out in shining red flashing letters stop this insanity and wake up from this self imposed hypnotic trance that all is well and Reverse Course!  But what course should we reverse to?  We need a complete reversal of policy on American manufacturing and begin to re-build that infrastructure throughout the United States but this time with a focus on smaller niche manufacturing hubs in small towns and rural America.  Yes Artificial Intelligence (AI) is replacing many manufacturing jobs but there are still jobs that only humans can do and there must be an intelligent plan of action that outlines a blueprint for American growth and prosperity that can be set in motion and accomplished by 2032.  We need to take action now and recapture the American ideals and values that made us who we are.  China has a revenue and savings base of $45 Trillion dollars that are now being unleashed throughout many parts of the world to build infrastructure in many developing countries. They will very probably soon demand that all exports and imports be transacted in Chinese Renminbi currency and back that currency by gold and this could have dire economic consequences to the dollar as the worlds reserve currency.  No military can save us from economic defeat for a shot need not even be fired in such a scenario. We must reverse course and return to sound monetary policy to build the industrial base in this country. Social programs are important but without real productive growth our economy can not be sustained through the printing of Trillions of dollars. This is not real growth. It is fake growth. We need to reverse course. Now.,political,Facebook
Aloha Friends  The federal investigations of the Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation the Kealoha matter and other City Administration officials and operations seem to be eroding public confidence in our government and leadership. I have been asked for my thoughts on the turmoil at City Hall and whether I have been associated with these investigations.  In a word NO.  Citizens must believe that their government is there to serve them that they can depend on their leaders to do whats best for the common good and that their elected and appointed individuals are honest and dedicated to fulfilling their responsibilities. Furthermore our ongoing pandemic and economic crises demand more than ever that the public trust their leaders to make sound decisions reached openly.  Neither I nor any of my cabinet members have been the subject of federal investigations. We were not contacted nor have we received any subpoenas either during our tenure in office or since. Its also important to point out that the ongoing federal investigations cover a period following my departure from City Hall in mid-2010.  When I took office I required my appointees to take ethics training with the Ethics Commission director telling us that we completed in two months what the previous administration took two years to accomplish. Beyond ethics training I required training on sexual harassment drug and alcohol abuse workplace violence and state procurement laws. We established the Integrity Hotline to give City employees a means to independently report ethical misconduct fraud abuse and other misdeeds to a party outside City government; the Hotline was named a best practice by the Government Finance Officers Association.  We must restore public confidence in City government. We must have leaders we can trust who will serve with integrity and vision. We must rebuild our economy and make this the best place to live work and raise our families.  These are my goals and one of the reasons why Im running for mayor of Honolulu.  -Mufi,political,Facebook
Vote for Trump?  Election 2020 is the most important election in American history. The stakes are high and it is not simply an election between Democrats and Republicans. The electorate has been polarized and from the perspective of voters they must choose between liberalism leading to socialism or conservatism leading to fascism. This is the first time in the history that Americans are convinced their vote is necessary to save us from either of these two political extremes. This in itself is telling and we are left wondering who are the people that brought us to this conundrum.  I have been a Republican for the better part of my life. However for the last several years I describe myself as being a Constitutionalist. I became one when I realized that both political parties had abandoned adherence to the provisions of our Constitution and as an American I find this hypocrisy to be abhorrent and alarming. What I also find abhorrent and alarming is that most Americans have no idea this is the case and even if they do shrug their shoulders in acceptance of the status quo.  What is it about a person that makes them an American? It is not our location on the planet or the physical boundaries of our nation. Instead it is that fact that we subscribe to the governing principles that define Americanism. The first of these is that we have established our government and all the power it has was given to it by us. We accomplished this through our Constitution. This is why government officials should abide by our Constitutions provisions. Today our government does not and both Republicans and Democrats share the blame for this.  In any case our present situation is critical! The Democratic party is not much different today than it has been in the past several elections. However this cannot be said of the Republican party. The Republican party has morphed into being a party that has embraced lies duplicity and deception as its operating prerogatives. It has done this to satisfy Donald Trumps lust for power and control over every aspect of our government. Trumps ambitions are not to be the best possible president but instead our most powerful president and possibly president for life.  The first indicator we have that this is the case is Trumps impeachment proceeding where he labeled the House Impeachment inquiry a hoax and ordered his subordinates to not cooperate with the Houses investigation. The fact that he did these things is astounding but no one in government or the media acknowledged how astounding it was. What people fail to understand is that an impeachment inquiry is only an inquiry and as such cannot be a hoax. It is an investigation which decides nothing other than whether or not its findings should be forwarded to the Senate for them to decide the matter. Understanding this what Trump did was something far worse than name calling or refusing to cooperate.  The Constitution gives the House the sole power of impeachment. This provides the House with the authority to investigate wrong doing on the part of government officials. Early on the House felt compelled to investigate President Trump. Once this happened under the Constitution it was Trumps duty and obligation to cooperate with the House investigation in every way. He refused to do this and instead demonstrated his contempt for Congress by labeling its investigation a hoax. Trump then compounded his crime by ordering his staff to not cooperate with the House investigation. At this point contrary to his oath of office Trump orchestrated a rebellion by the Executive Branch of our government against the legitimate and constitutional action of Congress. This treasonous criminal act screamed out for Trumps removal from office but the Republicans in the Senate knowingly and in clear violation of their oath of office let our contemptuous and treasonous president off the hook. Party loyalty was more important to them than their oath of office our Constitution and the people of this nation.  Donald Trump should never have been elected president. He lacks the character disposition and honesty required for such a high government position. Augmenting these shortcomings is the fact that Donald Trump is an egotist demanding overbearing rude inconsiderate and self-serving. In all honesty I voted for Donald Trump for much the same reasons as most of my fellow Americans. During his campaign Donald Trump came off as a maverick non-politician who was rich enough to forgo his own self-interest and stand against the political establishment that seemed to have forgotten about the average working American. Trump promised to drain the swamp without ever telling us which swamp he would drain. We never imagined that by draining one swamp he would create another swamp that would make the first one look like a mud puddle.  Trumps lack of insight and understanding makes him distrustful of science because science is something beyond his ability to control. This is why he botched and mishandled the corona virus pandemic. His incompetence resulted in unnecessary economic hardship for millions of citizens and the death of thousand upon thousands of Americans. Far worse than this Trump is still in denial of climate change. As a result in the interest of boosting the economy he has set back the environmental progress of our nation fifty years. What good is short term economic gain if it means a planet that will be a living hell for our children and their children until the end of time. It is this serious but not to the buffoon who occupies the White House.  In May of 2020 nine Governors of the United States Postal Service all presidential appointees appointed Louis De Joy to be Postmaster General. Louis De Joy inexplicably has no postal experience and is an associate and fund raiser to Donald Trump. Concurrent with these developments President Trump declared without evidence that mail in votes are subject to massive fraud. He also claimed that if he loses the coming election it will be because of fraud. In order to stir this pot more Postmaster De Joy has removed mailboxes from streets and removed and dismantled a plethora of mail sorting machines from key Postal facilities throughout the nation. This will significantly slow down distribution of the mail.  The Democrats surmise that Donald Trump is slowing down mail delivery because he believes a smaller mail in vote will work to his advantage. However in consideration of what we know about Donald Trump and also about what is presently transpiring this is absurd. Appearances are that something far more sinister is going on. Trump knows he is behind in the polls and that there is a very good chance of his losing a fair election. It is also a stretch to believe that by reducing votes he will swing the election in his favor. So what is a political strongman to do? The very real possibility exists that Trumps plans to steal the election. He can accomplish this is by slowing mail delivery and then have confederates steal destroy or burn as many ballots as possible. Once this is accomplished Trump will be in a position to declare the election invalid and postpone a new election to some time in the future. Of course the future will never come and Trump will end up being president for life.  How possible is the above scenario? I think it is clear that President Trump is capable of anything no matter how wrongful and underhanded. To think that eliminating a few votes to his benefit will satisfy his lust for power does not add up. Trump is the kind of person who wants a sure thing and to think that he will leave election 2020 to chance is naive.

"WAGES vs. INFLATION  So here we go with all of the inflation talk again; one could see it coming from the planet Pluto. Capitalism in the current environment is apparently incapable of providing real wage gains to workers. Wage gains currently reflected in increased unemployment benefits and one time transfers have shrunk the pool of available workers enabling available workers to demand higher wages.  Wage gains create inflationary pressures and the Federal Reserve's job is to maintain price stability--roughly defined at a 2% inflation target. If the rate exceeds this for a period of time the Nation's central bank the Federal Reserve (FED) will target higher interest rates effectively reducing the Nation's money supply in order to diminish both employment and wage demands.  The Federal Reserve (FED) has determined itself to run inflation a little hot above the 2% rate for a while and justifies this for having been unable to achieve its 2% inflation target for most years since the Great Financial Crisis. But a 4.2% annual inflation rate measure for the last monthly period has many analysts speculating the FED will tighten sooner then it had expected. Either way interest rates are going up; either the inflation component of the rate will rise or if the FED tightens the real component of the rate will rise. Higher interest rates mean lower asset asset values.  The general consensus in the markets is that inflation is bad so the FED while it will initially be patient with an inflation rate which exceeds 2% will quickly move to higher rates when it deems inflation a credible threat to longer term financial stability.  The whole point of this process is to slow down the economy in order to reduce employment and wage increase demands. So as stated above a capitalist economy is incapable of providing wage gains. This leaves the worker where the worker has often resided during the past decades in a weekly struggle to maintain housing utilities adequate healthy food and adequate healthcare. Not much has changed.  Is there a way out of this daily struggle for decent existence among the working class? The management class will say yes; productivity gains will enable working class advancement. In another era perhaps this was true; but this has proven false in a world of abundant labor and increased technological takeover of many human jobs. There is an excess of global labor so capital will either flee elsewhere in the face of wage gains and if not flee elsewhere capital will replace the worker with technology or a machine. Consequently the worker is left in a diminished job market with diminished market value.  Wages which equal market value is the problem. Imagine a world where technology leaves half of the world unemployed. What kind of wage will an additional worker to the labor force be able to demand? This is their market value. There must be a recognition that ""subsidies"" are necessary for workers to live a decent life. Subsidies are put in quotes here because subsidies are a very accounting specific measurement. Current accounting measures do not measure broader public gains and losses due to economic activity they measure only gains and losses specific to the private firm or to other corporate bodies. This aside if operating in an inflationary market this subsidy to the worker must represent a transfer of consumption from the upper classes to the lower classes in order to relieve inflationary pressure on production capacities.  This is why we should get nervous over union wage demands. It's not that their demands are not justified they are justified but their strategy for wage gains is very short term cannot last and fails to recognize that capitalism itself based on accounting measures of profits and inflation is incapable of advancing the material requirements of it's working class population.  Capitalism accounting does not account for the value added to a nation through a fully employed and well-educated populace. Both full employment and enhanced educational investment create short term inflationary pressures which lead to fears of an inflationary cycle. Consequently the two things which would advance the working class position: full employment which drives up wage rates and a good education which will advance future earnings are denied to them in order to prevent inflationary pressure.  It is all very structural and the system has little choice but to react in the manner in which it does in order to protect the private firm's balance sheet i.e. in order to avoid default. The tightening is painful for the firm but necessary in order to preserve the system with some level of stability.  Unions would be more effective if they united in a joint force and organized nonunion workers to join them in a mass political movement which demanded national economic policies which will actually improve workers' long term positions.  If wage gains produce inflation which forces the FED to take action which reverses those wage gains then this is a recognition that there is undue pressure on productive capacity. The FED policy makers and other analysts are correct that pressure on these facilities must be relieved in order to reduce inflationary pressures but labor needs to demand that the management class look elsewhere to relieve this pressure. Where elsewhere to look? At those who already consume too much. Why should struggling workers sacrifice their meager consumption in order to deflate inflationary pressures? It would be better to limit consumption among the well-off who already consume too much.  This transfer of consumption from the well-off to the unwell-off is most easily achieved through higher progressive tax rates. Lest we forget all was reasonably well when ""The top marginal tax rate in 1960 was 91% which applied to income over $200000 (for single filers) or $400000 (for married filers)  thresholds which correspond to approximately $1.5 million and $3 million respectively in today's dollars."" (). These higher progressive tax rates eliminated much of the excessive consumption which we see today freeing up resources for greater consumption among favored groups within the working class.  Meanwhile all the hope that the numerous labor disturbances across the globe will generate lasting advances for labor should be set aside. Under the current system with current accounting measures the world's central banks are forced to limit even reverse gains made by the working classes. Broader structural change is needed to serve working class needs. A transfer of consumption from the overconsuming portion of the population to the under consuming portions of the population will relieve pressure on productive capacity to allow greater consumption among the working class in a non-inflationary manner.",political,Facebook
"""Dear Leader"" Donald Trump is not a leader... Donald Trump is an instigator.  He claims that if Biden is elected ... America will burn. News Flash! ...

We need ""Gentleman"" Joe to quell the fires that go beyond peaceful protests and to push back not enable hateful armed right-wing fanatics.  Donald Trump did not and still has not led on Covid 19...he confused it with ""Covfefe"" 17. Covid is not a HOAX ""Covfefe"" is a product of his mental deficiencies.  Donald Trump did not and still is not leading on an economic collapse that has millions out of work... out of food... and likely sleeping in cars or on concrete slabs.

(No the stock market is not the economy it is currently unsupported speculation fueled by cheap money. It does little to directly help those currently suffering economic uncertainty.)  Donald Trump is not an anti-war activist. His embrace of Putin and Kim and other authoritarian leaders is not meant to keep peace it is simple adoration of ""tough guys"".  Trump sees himself as a ""tough guy"" tough guys he believes are winners. And Trump always aims to win be it by lawsuits bankruptcies defrauding his own charities his Trump University students or contractors. Most importantly he aims to win by supressing voters' ability to cast ballots by mail or through long poll lines.  ""Flak Jacket"" Joe will not take flak from Putin nor Kim Joe is in the Know when it comes to dealing with dictators. He won't instigate conflict with them but he will employ his years of foreign policy experience (Obama had none) to counter them and keep them at bay.  Nor is Trump an environmental activist. Just as with Covid whether or not a product of human activities it is not a HOAX! Climates are changing and whether we fight the changes or adjust to them we must respond or suffer health economic and environmental calamities including wide-spread forest fires.  ""Fire-Jumper"" Joe will re-engage in the Paris Climate Accords in a last ditch effort to curtail carbon emissions.

Since I see that there were 36618 new cases of virus yesterday in the United States and since for some reason on The Lone Liberal Republican Facebook page the post below has reached more than 41000 people I thought I would repost it in the hopes it reaches a few more who either need or have friends and family who need a little nudging to be thoughtful about combatting the virus. Different countries have done different thingsTaiwan never locked down but like Thailand almost everyone wears masks and contact tracing is robustand Taiwan has had seven deaths from the virus.  Here is the post (and apologies to those of you who have seen it already)  After months of paperwork to get the Lone Liberal Republican Facebook page eligible to promote posts again we are back. I currently live in Thailand and Facebook shut us down last Spring since our page is about American politics originating from a non-U.S. source. I assure you that I bear no resemblance to Vladimir Putin in any way whatsoever...but in any case it's good to be back.  Thailand is a middle income country of around seventy million people. There have been fifty-eight deaths here from the virus and no local cases for months. Life has mostly returned to normal though almost everyone wears a mask temperatures are taken entering malls restaurants parks and stores and hand sanitizer is everywhere. And the sports stadiums and nightclubs remain closed.  The resistance in the United States to masks and other steps routinely taken in countries in Asia and Europe to defeat the virus is regarded as insane and shameful to folks here...and in most of the world. And the fact that the resistance is framed in terms of Americans' constitutional rights--rights people in much of the rest of the world wish they had--is a horribly inaccurate framing of our rights.  Who thinks that in times of war drafting Americans to fight is an infringement of our Constitutional rights rather than an obligation of our citizenship? I doubt many of the Americans who refuse to wear masks today would be sympathetic to anyone making such an argument about serving in World War II or Vietnam. And in World War II Americans were drafted to do things like storm beaches with machine guns being fired at them as they did so. Being required to wear a piece of cloth around your mouth and nose is an infringement of your Constitutional rights? (Doing so is not an indication of weakness. It is a show of moral and ethical strength.) Lucky our soldiers in World Wars I and II Korea Vietnam Iraq and Afghanistan (though no American soldiers were drafted in the Afghanistan or Iraq conflicts) were more public minded. And lucky our elected officials didn't turn the other cheek when those few who refused their duty did so. Because the other thing here in Thailand and elsewhere around the world where the virus has been beaten back is the rules are enforced.  We are at war with the virus. The human casualties and devastation to our economy and social fabric are warlike devastation. As of the writing of this post the virus has killed more than 172000 Americans in less than eight months. By contrast 58209 Americans were killed in the Vietnam War between 1961 and 1975. 405399 Americans were killed in World War II in the five years between 1941 and 1945.  And any American with a pulse has seen the economic devastation and tearing of our already torn social fabric the virus has wrought.  So it's a war but one that countries from Asia to Europe have shown can be won in a few months of sacrifice. But sacrifice means rules that are uniformly applied and enforced. To date America has been like patients who take half of the antibiotic prescribed and then stop or only remember to take it every other day then complain that they aren't better.  Our political leadership needs to look around the world and get with the program. Thailand's death rate from the virus would have translated to about three hundred deaths given the U.S. population of three hundred and thirty million. What the countries that have defeated the virus have done is not rocket science...certainly the country that put men on the moon more than half a century ago can do this.

Lets keep Pennsylvania working by standing with President Trump and saying no to Joe and his Green New Deal.  This president built Pennsylvanias best economy in half a century when he unleashed the energy industry which brought tens of thousands of good paying jobs to our communities. A Biden Administration would take that away with job-crushing energy policies. Even though Joe tried to distance himself from the Green New Deal last night he cant hide the fact that his running mate Kamala Harris helped write it his party is all for it and his own website calls it a crucial framework.,political,Facebook
This organization created in 2006 from a combination of the labour women and cooperative movements to organize self-employed women in the informal economy and assist their collective. It create a union for self-employed women that countered both patriarchal and traditional trade union norms to convincing poor and disempowered women in the remotest areas of India that organizing and cooperative structures and processes could improve their work n living condition. This is a movement of self-employed women in rural and urban India.It has pioneered the empowerment of self-employed women and of women employed in informal economy enterprises (i.e. small unregistered enterprises) and where 93 per cent of Indias female labour force is employed1. This ognanisation is not only provides a voice to the numerous yet unprotected women workers but also seeks to ensure work and income security food security and social security for all its members and to promote womens leadership at the micro meso and macro level. The main activities consist of organizing self-employed women to promote their collective strength cooperation and leadership at the grassroots level through unions cooperatives producer groups and networks; facilitating their access to social security and social protection through social service organizations; advocating better social protection and labour standards for them at the macro-level; and building their capacity through formal education and professional training.,political,Facebook
19 Years Ago...  They say every generation has at least one true test of what it means to be an American and understand the freedoms we live daily are anything but free. Nineteen years ago was my generations. I started this post on the anniversary and it got a little more political than I intended so I chose to wait a few days and see how I felt so here goes...  Truthfully I never understood the emotional passion people had for events like the moon landing Vietnam and JFKs assassination to name a few. I didnt begrudge them but I didnt understand and then 9/11 happened. I wasnt in the midst of the tragedy in fact I was on the other side of the country. I listened and watched as the world as I knew it changed by the minute as this attack unfolded. I cried when the towers fell and I had never even been on a plane at that point in my life let alone New York but I knew what those towers stood for America and freedom.  Within those planes and towers were ordinary people going about their day just like I did today. They had no idea what fate they were about to endure or the chapter of history they were about write. The firefighters that entered the buildings carrying hundreds of pounds of equipment and realizing they wouldnt be able to save everyone I cannot fathom their emotional defeat at that realization because their heart is to serve and save yet they continued on. The passengers of Flight 93 who thwarted the final destination with their combined takeover listening to them say goodbye to their loved ones. There are so many stories about 9/11 that give you reason to grieve remembering that day and thankful for the country we live in and the freedoms we fight for.  We had become complacent in our freedoms which is why we couldnt fathom the depth of the attack that ensued on that day. Do you think that the passengers on that flight asked everyone their political or religious views before they banded together? The same for those who helped people get out of the towers? No! They asked are you strong enough for this fight?  In the days after 9/11 with the eeriness of total airport shutdowns and market closures Americans stood together waving their flags higher than they ever had and standing with one another to show that we are all Americans and we all feel this pain and sacrifice. The empathy that you have after experiencing an attack on your freedom made sense to me after 9/11.  Remembering this year I thought about our political struggles and COVID and how it affects our freedom. The simple answer for those opposed to shutting down the economy is that its about freedom and choice. Everyday we wake up we face challenges and our fates are tested not to the extreme of 9/11 but we make the choice to live our lives and whatever the fate of our choices brings. We are not opposed to regulations for public places but we are opposed to being told we cant live. You can make the choice to stay home and play it safe and that is your choice but there are others who choose to live and right now our own leaders are restricting our freedom not an outside force and so we choose to not live in sensationalized fear everyday.  I think this period is a test of freedom for the next generation but I dont think it is the harshest test they will have and quite frankly that is a little scary. I pray this generation gains empathy from these events and quit with the hate. I pray they gain strength they didnt know they had to stand on their own two feet and understand that our freedom is never free and being an American is not easy you have to want it. I pray for courage to understand differences and reach out to those they oppose. I pray for a better America than what we are currently experiencing because we are so much better than this.  Thank you to all of the survivors of 9/11 for sharing your stories and reminding us we are all Americans. And our differences are meaningless. Thank you to those who lost loved ones for sharing your last messages with your loved ones to show us humility and compassion. And thank you most importantly to those who lost their lives that day for showing how courageous ordinary citizens can be in the darkest of hours fighting for our country and giving us hope your lives were not lost in vain. God bless you all everyday!  #remembering911 #Trump2020 #BidenHarris2020 #thefactualfeline #election2020 #WeRemember #twintowers #GodBlessAmerica #GodBlessTheUSA,political,Facebook

Stability Honesty & Integrity are important qualities for leadership that I strive to have in my life.  These characteristics should be in your personal life as well as your public. What you are in one area of your life is what you are in all areas of your life.  One of the main reasons I am running is that I am tired of the stranglehold that good old boy politics has on Enterprise. I have had to fight this to be successful in my business.  It should not matter what your name is how long your family has been in Enterprise your current financial situation or even your social status. All people should have the opportunity for success without being crushed by the good old boy club.  I started my business in 1998 and there were some hard and lean times I worked hard to make it successful. There were times of anxiety and distress along the way even times I wanted to give up but after 22 years I have built a very successful business in Enterprise employing people locally and growing. Not only that but many businesses trust us to manage their Information Technology departments IT security and IT budgets. We have a reputation for honesty. I have taken a true startup business and made it a success.  My wife and I have been married for 17 years and have 4 children. There have been hard times and good times. There have been times of poverty and times of success. We committed to each other before we were married that this is for life and we would be faithful to each other. We are making it happen. I am happily married to the love of my life!  I have fought long and hard to get where I am. We had nothing handed to us. When we were first married my wife and I managed a low-income housing complex because we could not afford rent. We had our first 2 children on Medicaid because of no insurance and a very low income. When we left the apartment management we had to get a home on Section 8 assistance. My wife cleaned houses to help buy groceries while I was fighting to get my feet under me. I am so thankful for a faithful wife that stuck with through the bad times. Many days she was my cheerleader that got me through life.  I know what it is like to feel like I am finally making it to have the economy crash and my feet jerked out from under me.  I know what it is like to start at the bottom and work up. I am now blessed to pay enough taxes that anything we received in assistance has long been paid back.  I want to be the person that I needed when I was struggling. I want to help Enterprise be an easy city to succeed in. I want Enterprise to be the best place in Alabama to live work play and worship. I want Enterprise to be the city where people from all walks of life can succeed.  Vote Greg Padgett - August 25 at the Enterprise Rec Center!,political,Facebook

"Here is todays economic lesson.  Businesses absorb additional costs (such as higher taxes) in 2 ways. 1. Lower costs (usually payroll) or 2. Raise revenue (prices of goods). This also reduces profit margins which slow investment and growth (new jobs).  But how does this hurt the tax payer and not the rich like the democrats keep promising?  Joe Biden says he wants to tax the rich those making over $400000 a year and raise taxes on corporations. Allow me to explain why this will cost you more money than it will cost the corporations and how this is a ploy to get tax payers to pay for more government programs while the democrats can pretend they are not going to tax the people.  (Borrowed example)  Let's say Walmart makes a Billion Dollars a year and Joe decides to take away 10% of that income $100 million. Walmart will pass that cost on to the consumer you and me! However because of the ""New"" tax structure they will need to raise prices about 12% to recover that hundred million Biden took. Not only will you pay higher prices but you will also pay additional sales tax because the retail price is higher. So that 10% old Joe took from the corporations will cost YOU between 12% and 15% depending on where you live. Oh by the way same thing for a $15 minimum wage; business passes those costs on to the consumer as well.  Now you might say well the rich will pay the higher price too and you are right but here is the catch. The average working person spends 98% of his or her income while the wealthy spend roughly 60% of their income.  Taxing corporations shift the tax burden to the middle and lower class but in a sneaky roundabout way. The Liberals know this they are just hoping that you are too uneducated to think for yourself!  In the end the cost of all goods and service will increase and the middle and lower classes will bear the burden!  Don't be fooled by promises of free stuff or more government benefits; there is no such thing as a free lunch. The folks WILL pay for it all in the end. There is no such thing as Government Money the money that the government has was confiscated from We the People!  (End of borrowed example)  There is a reason every American was benefiting from the Trump economy prior to the pandemic. A truly free market without government intervention or taxation grows from the bottom up and benefits the working class more than any other economic strategy.  Get out and vote!",political,Facebook
"One thing democrats have. They always stick together. No matter how corrupt or dishonest a member is found to be they will support him or her and never abandon him. Hillary acid washed 33 000 emails after being subpoenaed but they never denounced her. Biden has been bribed but they stick by him.Maxine Waters encouraged open violence and they say and do nothing to her. No matter how corrupt how rotten when it is one of ""them"" they are behind him. Nothing is too scandalous or dirty or beneath their dignity if it is one of ""their own "". Not one democrat denounced the phony impeachment ! The fake news MSM allows them to get away with all their wrongdoings. The latest for the few days left before Election Day is to propagandize the ""Covid spikes and increases"". They can't fault Trump for the economy or for jobs or for trade deals or for the stock market rise.They cannot fault him for reducing taxes and regulations. They cannot criticize him for starting a war. They cannot fault him for the prosperity and wealth he created. They cannot fight MAGA or KAG.They cannot fault him for lack of ""ventilators"" and masks. They cannot say he is not close to having a vaccine for the virus. They can do one thing and one thing only. They can order the fake news and their operatives and their MSM corrupt allies and spinsters and activists and other hypocrite allies to falsely claim that the Covid is ""spiking"" and blame him for doing a terrible job in handling it. They can pretend as though if they were in charge nobody would have died. He acted sooner than all of them despite their criticism yet they say he killed two hundred thousand plus Americans. He acted while they were shamelessly trying to impeach him for no good reason. Any one else in his position would have been totally distracted  They the democrats would have let die millions. Cuomo was one who really caused the death of innocent elderly New Yorkers. Do not pay attention to these false claims of ""spikes"". This too is propaganda and misinformation and political warfare. None of my family or friends or their friends or their families have had any ""NEW"" Covid virus spike or sudden increase. Many others tell me the same thing. Check it out for yourselves.

The Democrats multi-trillion dollar spending spree is the largest tax increase in our nation's history and comes at a time when Kansans are already facing skyrocketing inflation and a stagnant economy.  Here are 5 of the most outrageous policies hidden in this bill:  1 Props up the Green New Deal with $630 billion at the expense of small businesses. 2 Imposes $2.1 trillion in tax increases on American families and job creators. 3 Funds abortions by ignoring bipartisan Hyde Amendment protections. 4 Impedes and bans domestic energy and mineral production increasing our dependencies on resources supplied by OPEC Russia and China. 5 Includes provisions that promote amnesty for more than 8 million illegal immigrants.

Everyday I seem to be learning and hearing new phrases here is the latest: mind Olympics. What is that? It is said that in the last 6 months we have had to try and process the affairs of humanity faster that we have ever had to do it before. Think about it for a minute. Covid-19 shutdown of the economy opening and closing numerous times social upheavals fires storms elections stimulus non-stimulus.. I think that you get it now. The human mind is constantly going from happy to sad anger to peace move of stay. The rate of information and opinion from social media and other sources can be at times overwhelming. BUT! There is hope. The Lord tells us that I will keep you in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on me because they trust in me. Isa. 26:3. Daily we have a choice to keep our mind on the Lord or to focus using mind Olympics on the things of this earth that will soon disappear. Just the thought of mind peace is refreshing to say the least. So the end of this post asks the question what are you going to do today? I choose peace this is Gods perfect will for you.

"LOW WAGE EMPLOYMENT AND THE HEALTH PANDEMIC  Recently I was appalled while listening to a financial podcast during which two separate guests complained that businesses were having a hard time hiring help mostly in low wage industries as workers were being paid too much to stay at home. The implication being that the average national unemployment benefit of roughly $620 weekly which includes both state and federal benefits enabled workers to forsake life risking low wage employment--which it does.  One of the interviewees: nice enough guy was from Myrtle Beach Florida. His complaint was that restaurants and motels which dominate this resort community could not find sufficient help to meet the demand of visiting resort-goers. The class arrogance of this statement gave me one of those ""ugh"" capitalism moments.  Most people are not born on a plot of land which grants them title to a lifetime of sustenance. They are dependent on a system which dictates poverty and low wages at one end of the system so those on the other end of the system may prosper. Now we find ourselves in the midst of a global health pandemic and it is not enough that some peoples' lives are banished to hardship and despair but now they are also expected to risk their lives and the lives of family and others in order for others to enjoy a game of gulf indulgent meals and luxurious motels.  Meanwhile according to a Wall Street Journal analysis: ""[m]edian pay for the chief executives of more than 300 of the biggest U.S. public companies reached $13.7 million last year up from $12.8 million for the same companies a year earlier"". Many workers engineers marketing types and so forth continue to work from the safety of their homes which is a good thing all precautions should be taken in order to maximize the health and safety of everyone.  None of this should surprise us as the whole capitalist order is built on the idea that one's person's material extravagance is more important than another's material needs and apparently also more important than workers' health needs. But this particular story laid bare the corrupt foundation of the capitalist order.  There is no effort here to question the moral basis of those who engage in this unneeded consumption. It is likely that most of the participants actually believe they are doing a good thing such as providing a job strengthening the economy or more likely have not thought deeply about the issue. But we can certainly question the capitalist ideology which justifies this behavior. Capitalism is a bankrupt moral ideology which lifts indulgent consumption over the health and life of its workers. It sacrifices workers' lives in war in unhealthy consumption and now to the extravagant consumption desires of the upper economic classes: all in an effort to feed its profit machine while maintaining lives of comfort and wellbeing for the administrators of the system. It is all very structural all must participate even the well-off it is inherent to the competitive structure of the capitalist machine. It stems from the false notion that the path to happiness lies along the path of unneeded consumption even though this unneeded consumption imposes hardship on others.  Workers have the voting power to change this system. They often however are too overwhelmed by survival to meaningfully engage in the process. They are spoon fed patriotism and nationalism and are left to believe that this is the best their lives can be. Too often workers fail to see the enemy in their lives: a bankrupt ideology whose life span has outlived any useful purpose it may have served if it ever served any useful purpose at all.",political,Facebook

Senate candidates usually dont spend much time talking about preschool.  *But we do.*  Thats because making early childhood education a higher priority holds so much potential to tackle so many problems at once.  It's the intersection of every possibility and when we miss it its the starting point for a lot of challenges.  For kids this brings together issues like literacy and emotional development and social development and the achievement gap and eventual quality of life.  For families this is about their kids but its also about their finances.  The average preschool in North Carolina costs over $9000 a year.  For comparison tuition at UNC-Chapel Hill is $7000 a year.  That means putting two kids through preschool in North Carolina is the same as putting two kids through college.  But with preschool were asking parents to do that at the beginning of their careers when theyre at their lowest earning point and before theyve had time to save.  And for the rest of us early childhood education is about breaking the generational cycle of poverty spending less on incarceration having a workforce thats stronger and an economy thats more competitive - but its also about living up to our belief as Americans that everyone should get a fair shot no matter the circumstances of their birth.  So what are we going to do about it?  Well if these kids could advocate for themselves we wouldnt be having this conversation because we would have been doing the platinum edition of early childhood education a long time ago.  But they cant advocate for themselves so we have to do it. We have to choose to make them a higher priority instead of going another ten or twenty years pretending like were already doing enough.  This issue always gets pushed to the back.  This campaign is going to pull it to the front.  In an incredibly divisive time this can be an issue that unites us all *and* accomplishes a generational achievement on behalf of our children and their children and their children.  Expanding access to preschool and pre-k is absolutely essential and its supported by 75% of voters.  We know the right thing to do here its just about making a decision to finally do it.  - Jeff,political,Facebook
"My name is Drew King a life-long resident of Illinois husband father of two dogs and a proud member of the Palatine community and I am running for the Illinois State House of Representatives.  When we look at our State we need to say that there needs to be a lot more up in the way in which its managed. It's time we get to taking care of our neighbors rebuilding the economy education reform and overhaul our public pension system.  Due to the pandemic it seems that every day we see our friends and neighbors struggling to find the money to afford food and pay their rent and mortgages. As a means of combating this I would push companies to halt layoffs by putting workers on part-time schedules with partial Unemployment Benefits. Id also request that the Federal Government provide better federal funding for these Unemployment Insurance programs during economic dilemmas like ours now.  Also affordable education is a must so that students can attend colleges and universities without the burden of graduating with an enormous amount of debt therefore I will work with Local Banks on providing little-to-no-interest Student Loans. If I had the opportunities for Work-Study and low-interest loans I would not have graduated with over $50000 in Student Loan debt which took close to 20 years to pay off. The importance of providing the next generation of students an achievable education cannot be emphasized enough and having a mother-in-law that taught for 30 years has only solidified my stance on this.  Just as I will focus on the Economy and making Education Affordable I will concentrate on Womens Rights and Healthcare for all. My plan would be to host health fairs at least twice a year in which one concentrates on Womens Health providing free breast cancer screenings and a second where I will work with local Healthcare providers to offer free drive-up STI Testing drives for those 14- to 21-years old.  As a pragmatic and fiscally responsible businessman I value cause and effects over details and circumstances and am pro-economic growth and pro-innovation.  As a political moderate a main focus that I have is a focus on helping the disenfranchised feel empowered to make strong confident decisions to be successful in life.  It is this importance of social equality that I bring to my day-to-day life by helping others hold themselves accountable and responsible in the areas in life which can be controlled through their abilities and talents and work on identifying areas out of their control and find methods to take back that control. This includes opposing political changes which would result in a significant shift of society strongly to either the left or the right.  Having worked since the age of 16 to support both my family and myself I have not given up on the working class unlike opponents on both sides of the political aisle due to their lengthy tenures in office that have led them down the path to represent the professional class.  To this day I value hard work determination and take pride in what Ive helped others to accomplish as well as what I have been able to accomplish.  I support Unions. All of the money that unions spend on the candidates that they endorse comes from the pockets of working people; it is precious. For Unions every dollar that is donated to politicians is a dollar that is not spent on organizing new union members therefore I will only seek endorsements from Unions and not accept campaign donations from these extraordinary hard workers.  I embrace policies that help people and are popular with the Democratic base but more importantly the broader public. Some obvious places to start include expanding Social Security increasing infrastructure spending across the country and lowering prescription drug prices.  When I say I'll embrace policies that means trumpeting them in headlines not hiding them away in the ""Policy"" section of my campaign's website burying them underneath cutesy unnecessary jabs at Republicans or relegating them to one paragraph of a 20-minute stump speech.  I have a commitment to pursue the interests of my potential constituents by having fiscally sustainable policies across a range of issues such as: - unemployment and the economy - health care reform - affordable education reform - property taxes - expanded voting rights - domestic violence - pension reform and - funds for our District  I will advocate for these in a bipartisan consensus rather than conflict with political opponents. I will act as a check and balance on legislation that I feel is too far to the right or too far to the left on the political spectrum.  After 10 years in office and just winning reelection there are a number of people who strongly feel that Tom Morrison the current IL State Representative representing the 54th District is out of touch and just as many feel his party the GOP is out of touch.  Mr. Morrison has proven that: - he is not an effective leader - is someone who does not listen to his constituents rather putting his own interests and beliefs before the interests and beliefs of those he is in office to represent and most importantly - has only co-sponsored (not sponsored) five Key bills in The House where some passed and others never made it past the Rules Committee (I feel he has not provided any benefit to this District or the State other than towing the Republican line in saying ""No"" when he's expected to).",political,Facebook

"When I was teaching students in my classroom and their parents said ""Once a Rigano's Raider always a Rigano's Raider."" I wouldn't have it any other way.  After 31 years as a professional educator with 24 of those years in Beavercreek and 18 years as a business owner I know about operating a budget building relationships organizing people and the important role schools play in a child's life.  The great experiences I have shared with over 1000 students in my career families business partners and wonderful community members led to my decision to retire from teaching and run for a seat on the Beavercreek Board of Education.  I believe that a Board of Education must build relationships with everyone who has a stake in the school district: Students and their parents; Employees of the school district and; Taxpayers who don't have students in our schools.  You might ask: ""Why is it important to engage people who don't have kids in the public schools?"" The answer is in an article entitled ""Perspectives"" written by Michael Goar executive director of Generation Next ""As the Schools Go So Goes the City"" he states. The article points out that ""Quality public schools improve the local economy and attract business. Schools educate the local labor force and increase the areas quality of life by attracting skilled workers. Educated individuals enjoy a higher standard of living and increased social capital.""  We must engage all of our stakeholders by utilizing new and improved communication strategies. Just like in the classroom students will participate if they understand the relevance of a project.  The top priority for any school district is the safety and well-being of students and staff and to provide them with the resources they need to offer students the best education possible.",political,Facebook

Hi there and thank you for visiting my page!  I was born and raised in Otego graduating from Unatego High School in 2016.  I attended Hamilton college in Clinton NY and majored in Economics before returning home in March 2020 when the virus struck.  While in college I interned at the treasurers office for 3 summers and two winters - including during the pandemic.  Currently I am a financial aid assistant at SUNY Oneonta where I have been for the past 8 months.  I am running because I want to leave this world better than I found it.  I look around at Otego and Laurens and I genuinely worry about what the next 10-15 years hold.  At least in my lifetime I have watched rural communities be left behind.  My goal is to challenge everyone on the board to act now.  Time is of the essence and I want to ask difficult questions that dont have easy answers.  I want to make the case that our rural communities need more investment.  I want to create a more sustainable economy that doesnt rely on baseball college and retail to employ so many of our residents.  I want to change the course of our countys history.  I genuinely worry that if the current representative stays in office Otego and Laurens will miss out on opportunities.  Now more than ever we must act.,political,Facebook

Cuomo to let them open to 50 percent capacity and let weddings sweet 16s ceremonies and other activities that were put on hold during the COVID pandemic to take place.  Catering facilities have been brought to the brink of bankruptcy with no cash flow since March and living on loans; they must be allowed to open at 50 percent capacity said the events organizer Riverhead Councilwoman Jodi Giglio. They make up a large portion of our economy and secondary businesses including invitations bakeries bridal and tuxedo shops hotels DJs florists photographers and videographers live music and transportation businesses supporting the industry are suffering also. The trickling down effect of these restrictions on the industry is immense. Restrictions decimated the summer tourism season when they should have been allowed to operate safely. Gov. Cuomo must lift the arbitrary 50-person restriction and let them open to 50 percent capacity the councilwoman added.  Regardless of the size of the facility the governor capped these businesses at no more than 50 guests said Giglio a candidate for the state assembly. Facilities with the capacity for 300 500 and 700 guests are being forced to operate as if they were all the same size. They are going bankrupt and need to feed their families. We need the governor to let them safely serve their customers put their employees back to work and pay their bills.  According to Assemblyman Joe DeStefano the weddings and other events that catering halls count on to stay in business were cancelled at a rapid rate as the states economy was shut down. Caterers were put out of business for months and now are being told that they can only have up to 50 guests. This doesnt make sense for the majority of facilities that can safely host many more people than that.  Caterers have been targeted by state authorities for being a few people over the limit and some have had their licenses suspended or revoked said Assemblyman Anthony Palumbo who called on the governor to at least make the allowed occupancy at least 50 percent of capacity. This would allow for ample social distancing for a society that is now well accustomed to the need to wear masks and practice good hygiene. Palumbo who is running for the retiring Kenneth LaValles state senate seat added: Many businesses have proven they can operate safely and the catering halls are no exception. Why is it then that they need such tight restrictions?  Enough is enough said an owner whose facility can hold up to 500 people but is restricted to just 50. The state came down hard on an East End hall that had plenty of room to safely accommodate the 94 guests that showed up. They weren't going to turn them away because they had plenty of room to safely host them. Shutting them down and revoking their license in light of the economic hardship they are facing is just not right. Facing penalties of $10000 per violation and paying lawyers fees when the PPP loans ran out three months ago is unaffordable and impractical during these difficult times for our industry.  These businesses are scared to death said Giglio who is running for the assembly on a pro-business platform. They fear going bankrupt and are afraid to say anything for fear of the state cracking down on them. They have enlisted their elected officials on the local level in their fight to get back in business.  The caterers have filed a class action lawsuit seeking permission to fully reopen. We know more about safety precautions than we ever did and at this point the restrictions seem arbitrary and punitive said Giglio We need to focus more on the local economy and getting back to normal and less on exercises in power from the state. These restrictions are unconstitutional and are destroying business owners ability to make a living. Businesses should be allowed to reopen at 50 percent and let their patrons decide on their level of safety.  The caterers have a website at We fully understand the seriousness and gravity of the current pandemic the caterers' state. Private Events are the lifeblood of New York and an engine of prosperity for the City and State. Without private and public events our cultural political economic and physical landscapes have been dramatically altered. While the procedures and protocols for safety are essential to resuming business it is our utmost PRIORITY to ensure that our employees clients and guests have sufficient confidence in our industry so we can reopen and safely host private events. We are committed to returning employees to the events industry safely while complying with the protocols and mandates implemented by the City and State Governments as it pertains to gatherings.,political,Facebook
"Election 2020 By PAUL DAQUILANTE Of the News-Register  ""... Green endorsed Bledsoe for the treasurers job which he maintains should be a full-time position given the complexity of managing the countys portfolio.  If Paulette were running as a stand-alone could she do the job? Yes Green said. But do I think Kris can do a better job? The answer is also yes.  He added I have no problem with Paulette. But Ive watched both of them in operation and when it comes to performance and engage- ment its a no-brainer.  Bledsoe who has a degree in economics from the Uni- versity of Washington said whoever is elected must understand the bond market.  I have the training to enable you to think clearly and logically about events that are happening in the economy she said. Bledsoe said there is no question she is the best- qualified candidate and it goes beyond her education professional experiences and a desire to hold office. I believe we all have an obligation to give back to the community she said. What that means is different for everyone.",political,Facebook
And so we have passed through the second winter of our discontent to rip off Shakespeare. The virus has ripped through the country with a vengeance over half a million dead that didnt need to die if only the government that was had told us the truth and given us the guidance and help that we needed in the beginning. Millions have lost their livelihoods businesses have shuttered their doors for good the economy is shot to shit and there are people who think that the new governments go big or go home relief package is. A waste of time and money because it will bail out the average citizen raise hundreds of thousands of families out of poverty make sure that there is enough life saving vaccines against this virus that has so devastated this country is available to everyone that wants it will save as many small businesses as possible and they are worried that its all on the taxpayers dime.  Who do they think paid for those tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy in 2017? You know the 1.7 trillion in tax cuts that mostly went to the top ten percent. Oh sure there were some minor (and I do mean very minor) tax savings for those of us on the bottom but those expired last year and this year. What? You didnt notice? Oh trust me you will when you file your taxes.  I keep hearing about all of this Democratic pork that went into the American Rescue Plan. Could someone point it out to me? Please? Pretty please?  Of course this also means that Joseph R. Biden IS actually President of the United States. There is no going back. (Thank God!) And I dont foresee a return to office of the last guy. In fact I think hes going to have a different gig altogether. And its not going to be a good one. But thats neither here nor there. He (Biden) would like both sides of the aisle to work together. Not with Mitch McConnell in charge of the Right side. Which is sad. If both sides worked together just imagine what could be accomplished! Up until the 90s and the rise of Newt Gingrich thats the way it worked and we accomplished great things! And now we can barely keep our heads above water. I hope that makes Republicans happy. Because as a citizen of this country it pisses me off.  We are also marking a few anniversaries  one year since the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor (to name a few). We as a nation need to sit up and take notice of these deaths and the deaths of so many other black and brown citizens at the hands of our police officers. While we were angered at the deaths of the police officers at the attempted coup on January 6th and the screaming that Blue Lives Matter we MUST acknowledge that our black and brown brothers and sisters are just as precious to us and to our country as our police. We MUST acknowledge that they have the right to stand up for themselves and we MUST support them in any way possible.  True story  As a middle-aged white woman I am more afraid of white men than I am of black or brown men. I am more likely to hold tighter onto my purse in a crowd of whites than I am in a mixed crowd. I used to work the shooter shift in a convivence store and I was more afraid of the whites that came in than I was of the gang bangers because I knew that the black and brown community had my back.  So there you have it.  We have to find ways to work together.,political,Facebook
PASS Parents and Friends  (Dan here.)  This weekend our three high schools will graduate 456 amazing young adults. As the father of one such graduate I could go on and on about how proud we are of them how much they achieved in difficult circumstances etc. but before I do that maybe I should say something we probably ought to say more here. Id like to thank the community that has paid for my daughters education. Some have done so willingly and some reluctantly but everyone who has owned a home or property in the county in the last 13 years contributed and I am grateful.  I know that for some people in some years paying local taxes is not painless and I know that to some extent local spending for education competes with local spending for public safety social services parks and rec and other important things. For most of the 13 years my daughter has been a student the people of this community have chosen to make education a priority because most people understand how important it is. So I think I speak for a lot of parents of graduating seniors when I thank this community for the sacrifices it has made to prepare these 456 people for life as an adult.  Ill show my gratitude by supporting the education of your kids and their kids and the kids who will someday become your mayors and county officials; your deputies and teachers; your doctors and lawyers; your clergy and perhaps the nurses aide who attends you in the retirement home in the last years of your life. Thats how it works. It may be a clich but investment in education is investment in the future.  To the Class of 2021 this community is so proud of all youve achieved particularly given the obstacles you have faced. The pandemic cost you the spring of your junior year and part of the fall of your senior year before a gradual return to something approaching normal. But with remote hybrid and in-person learning truncated sports seasons improvised art programs etc. you have managed to have something almost resembling a normal senior year culminating in graduation this weekend; you should be proud of yourselves.  Some of you will leave us for college; some will use junior college as a pathway to university or a career. Some of you will enter trades (perhaps because of training you received at Triplett) and some will take other jobs either here or elsewhere. Many of you  probably most of you  will go away for a time but we hope some of you will come back and it falls to us to create an economy worth coming back to. Wherever your life takes you I hope you remember where you came from and share some pride in --- and gratitude toward  the community that supported your education.  Dan,political,Facebook
"A toastAnna raised a crystal glass of 2029 Dom Prignon to the fruit of our reps!  Our reps! replied Annas colleagues gathered around a table of fine linens and sumptuous food. All of them drained their glasses except one.  Whats the matter Ivy? Anna asked with a nod to the nanochip in Ivys wrist. Not drinking? Youre still a few craft cocktails shy of damaging your impeccable rep.  Im sorry said Ivy. I dont mean to be a downer but isnt anyone else concerned?  Struthio lifted his head from his plate. About what? he croaked through a mouthful of foie gras and sweet wine.  About tonights election said Parsons. Much ado about nothing if you ask me. Our people arent going anywhere.  Anna twisted her mouth. Parsons werent you the one last week whining whether or not to hedge your bets against a new government? Parsons cast his eyes down to an empty glass. Anyway Anna rolled on nobody but an ignorant fool would vote for them. We will not lose.  If that did happen said Schaden and I am confident that it will not then at least millions of others will be worse off than me.  A server responded to a signal from Parsonss empty glass and filled it to the brim. Anna recognized the waitress. Mary? she said.  Mary looked just long enough to place Annas face from her school days. She recalled how Anna had always been part of an in-crowd. Yes Maam she answered and discreetly faced away.  Anna tilted her head to try and catch Marys eyes.  Its the digital golden age for goodness sake said Parsons. It holds those draft-dodging dishonest degenerates accountable for undermining the order of things.  And punishes those who refuse to comply with administrative rulings added Struthio.  Its an adaptive and continuously improving system which keeps us safe and facilitates a healthy market economy Anna proclaimed with divided attention.  It exposed the academic fraud at my last job said Ivy emboldened by the others.  All eyes were on the only chipped-one at the table who had not paid a compliment to The System. Schaden sensed the scrutiny and leaned in for all the beacons to hear And uh . . . an innovative means to advance the rule of law? The others smiled and Schaden relaxed back into his meal.  Anna watched Mary rush between the tables in dutiful response to the torrent of signals from the tableware. You know her? said Ivy.  Years ago in school and only in passing said Anna. A radical of the worst sort. Thats what the posts said.  Well said Ivy look at the two of you now. You are the supervisor  the most coveted position in the High Ministry  while she she just is.  Anna returned a self-satisfied smile. Yes I am.  After several minutes of appropriate conversation Anna bid farewell to the others. On her way out her dental nanochip settled her proper share of the bill signaled a car and opened all the doors. Two steps to the curb into a pristine self-driving car and Anna was whisked off.  The unshared sans souci ride to her apartment took rep-restricted lanes past cars stuck in heavy city traffic avoided busy intersections and followed exclusive detours around construction work. Annas premium music played in the background while the video screen displayed election returns from her personalized newsfeed. It had been a close race but Annas candidate was sure to win once all of the district reports were tallied. The car swiftly arrived at the guarded entrance to Annas building and she settled in for another blissful nights sleep.  * * *  Anna woke to the crackle of static from her virtual assistant. Not my music channel she wondered and feeling far too refreshed for a workday morning a glance at the clock confirmed she had overslept. She hopped into the shower and luxuriated beneath the steaming spray as she adjusted her schedule: First she spoke to the beacons a message to the techs regarding the failure of my virtual assistant; Second contact Parsons about What the fu . . . uh . . . uh! Anna recoiled from the stream of water which had gone icy cold. S-scratch that last item. Report a problem with the hot water.  Anna bound down the steps of her apartment building and entered the waiting car. Inside she found a man asleep beneath a crumpled business jacket. There must be some mistake she thought but there were no other cars. Then it occurred to her that the alarm malfunction cold shower and now this rideshare were all the result of a dead nanochip. Add dentist visit for a capacitor check.  The car ride was bumpy the floor sticky. It reeked of sweat and stale beer and dissonant music accompanied pornographic displays elicited by the businessmans signal. Anna wrinkled her nose at the lump snoring beside her and fantasized about ripping out his nanochip. The car jerked to a stop behind an endless row of cars. Anna sat helpless as the cars in the rep-restricted lane  her lane  whizzed past.  The hellish ride ended at the curb on the side of the street opposite the High Ministry. An arrival tone aroused the businessman who cursed his way out of the car grumbling they cant do this to me and then he disappeared into what Anna regarded as the lowest of the ministries the Bureau of Hospitality Services. She waited for the car to swing around to her side of the road until she recalled the problem with her nanochip; reluctantly she got out there and walked across the street.  Anna nearly broke her nose on the glass doors. Shi-oot! Her predicament drew condescending looks from the others whose functioning nanochips opened doors ahead of them. Darn capacitors she said loud enough to excuse her to no one in particular. Perhaps if she got close enough to the door scanner even a weak response from her nanochip might work. Anna stepped aside to press her face against the glass and snarled her tooth right up to the receiver. Anna! Schadens voice cried out from behind. Anna turned  red.  The doors hissed open at Schadens approach. Can you believe it! he said. He actually lost! And the new ministers wasted no time running their moral algorithms against our lifetime data. It may be the fastest reputation recalculation ever. My rep-score dipped a bit but then my position at the Ministry is only mid-level. Schaden took a breath and Anna anxiously eyed the open doors. What had happened began to dawn on Anna.  Honestly said Schaden. I am surprised to see you here. Not that Im not happy for you but I took you for a true if were right they must be wrong loyalist. Schaden cupped a hand against his mouth. Like me he whispered you must have behaved a bit uh independent outside the office.  Anna nodded in false agreement.  After you Schaden gestured toward the open doors. Anna could have entered and temporarily avoided embarrassment but the inevitable security escort back out of the building would be far more shameful.  Thank you no Schaden said Anna. I think Ill take a short walk first.  Schaden shrugged and passed through the doors which closed behind him. Anna brooded over a stark realization. She was roused from sleep by her virtual assistant but not with her premium channel. The shower turned on but the hot water was rationed. A car had waited but it brought her to . . . Anna forced herself to look across the street at the lowly Bureau.  Her nanochip had not died Anna was loath to accept it was she that had lost her life to a system of reward and punishment based on the conceit of changing norms which now decided she would no longer be liked followed tagged checked or viewed.  The doors swooshed open behind Anna. Turning in a fleeting moment of hope she watched that radical of the worst sort Mary stride past to begin her new position in the High Ministry.  ****  ""We the Liked"" by John Elgan",political,Facebook
Our state parks alone (not including Acadia National Park) bring in more than $100 million to Maine's economy. Maine only conserves 20% of its land while other New England states conserve much more. Maine's entire economy is based on our environment. Investing in the environment is a return that keeps on giving. We're leaving a lot of money at the state border by failing to keep pace with our neighbor states on conservation. Research shows there is untapped potential in our environment in Maine: hundreds of millions of additional dollars could flow into Maine's economy -- and in areas that need it the most in our poorest counties -- if we increased conservation with public access.

"A CONSPIRACY THEORY D This is part of a series I have been writing on the subject there is much more I am still writing and will post some links in the comments Democrat or Republican we all need to open our our eyes.  Let's try this again. I am afraid to say what is in mind  not really afraid to say it but I fear where we are and where we are going and the future unless we stop and come to our senses quick looks scary.  We have an old tradition in this countrywhen we want to bring freedom and democracy to a foreign land we do one of two things we invade the country topple the regime and find some sellouts to replace the local government or we send arms to some disgruntled faction or two or three to start a civil war let their people destroy the country and we help whoever is the biggest traitor that will sell out the country to us.  The fact is that in a civil war there are no winning sides whoever comes up on top ( a civil war can last generations even) has to make a deal with an outsider or some super rich entity (ies) to maintain power and to establish controls. The super rich are not affected by the war itself in most inst6they may just go outside the war area ( even overseas) and come back later to assume power or control rebuilding effort and thus profit. In modern times the foriegn investment is stopped jobs and industries are lost poverty and misery spreads in all directions and for all sides.  If an entity or a power wanted to destroy the United States of course starting a civil war here would be the best way to destroy the nation its power and economy also. Let us assume that their is a ""cabal"" that is bent on destroying the country and taking control to destroy democracy and and set up autocratic regime todaybwould a good day since we are ready and willing to do it to ourselves. And how convenient if that power was to control parts of the government and the political apparatus already.  The two sides in the country today left and the right are willing to do it the right apparently thinks they have more guns so they will have the upper hand as most of the police and much of the military has already been brainwashed by their side and will be willing to kill for their purpose. They have been convinced that they are on the right side of history and they are sure to win the power. Of course the powers that be  the ones that are aiming to destroy democracy and and ruin the country have already a leader in place to do their bidding to call his followers to arms and to do the dirty work of encouraging civil strife.  More to follow  M. N. R.  12 OCTOBER 2020  CRISIS  An incident or an occasion that causes and brings about a lasting change in a person or even a society. That change once again depends upon the knowledge and the reasoning ability of the person or the society as a whole. The reasoning ability here depends upon education and also upon upbringing nature and nurture as they say. The same instant that will cause one to get motivated and work hard and get an education or such to get ahead could cause another to rob a store join a gang become a hooker or even join a church.  M. N. R.  12 OCTOBER 2020  VICTIMS  Once one has reached majority and claims maturity all choices are deliberate and all consequences always predicted.  If a baby is molested or a child is abused they have no control over the situation but when a person of age abuses alcohol or drugs drives drunk robs or kills drops out of school and has babies they can't afford they are not victims they know what they are doing and should be held responsible.  M. N. R.  That the democracy and the country itself is facing ruin regardless of who wins on the 3rd of November while both sides bicker about the supreme court nomination or the COVID-19 crisis we have bigger issues that need immediate attention. But we have been deliberately mislead. The plan is being worked by both sides to keep the population occupied with trash. I had warned about the militia plans and the infiltration of police and the military. I have written about the BLM and their misguided focus on the police brutality only. If there is a conspiracy it is about keeping the population confused and at each other's throat instead of solving problems. I wrote back in February how COVID-19 will impact everything we know about life from work to education and food  no one is talking about the new realities not in a major way and the public still has no idea what the new world will look like in a couple of years.  While a low level civil war or at least unrest is a real possibility regardless of who wins #republican side is not even trying to promote calm and peace. We will all pay for it. If Trump wins and igive him an 80% chance his followers may go to ""weapons free"" anyway.  Is it the conspiracy of the elite to start a civil war and destroy the democracy and install an autocratic regime. If I were betting I'd say that this the plan. A conspiracy right in your face and you are a willing participant. Only you lose is by winning. I am by no means done here do come back there is a lot more to this  M. N.

"My name is Drew King and I am running as a Democrat for the Illinois State House of Representatives. As a life-long resident of Illinois husband father of two dogs and proud member of the Palatine community I look forward to serving my constituents.  My upbringing in Illinois consisted of a one-income working family with a stay-at-home mom where my parents instilled ethics morals and values in me.  I grew up with my mother taking care of my sister and me while my father worked hard to provide us everything he could. We lived paycheck-to-paycheck and that made it hard at times. I remember the sound of bill collectors calling our home at all hours and I saw my family's vehicles be repossessed. No matter how hard things were my parents felt it was important for their children to receive a good education and instill values of morals and ethics which I still hold true to this day.  I also learned how fragile financial security is and that things need to change and I am confident in saying that that we need a lot more of ""up"" in Illinois and it's time for a change.  What do I mean by up?  It means that instead of looking down at how our State is being run we need to look up - we need to look forward to what can be achieved and make the necessary changes to work together Democrats and Republicans alike to have a more prosperous State.  At 16 years of age I began to work part time jobs to help my parents make ends meet. This showed me the importance of working together as a family toward a common goal. I am the first person in my family to not only go to college but graduate.  Later in life I became a self-taught businessman working in Information Technology with Teams both in the States and Internationally in the UK and India. Throughout my career I have never given up on the working class. To this day I value hard work determination and take pride in what Ive helped others to accomplish as well as what I have been able to accomplish myself.  Today we find ourselves in turbulent financial times during which many people have had to take pay cuts been furloughed or even worse lost their jobs. There needs to be a stronger focus on helping our neighbors put food on their table and be able to afford to pay their rent or mortgage.  As CDC Guidelines are relaxing there are still working-class families that have not been able to afford to get back to work even with Federal Government funds due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Rising childcare costs healthcare costs and low wages make it difficult.  I support programs that will bring more jobs  for example having more infrastructure projects in the greater Palatine Arlington Heights Prospect Heights and Rolling Meadows areas. The biggest way for job creation is through job training and job retainment programs which increase the availability of jobs and address changes in the knowledge required for the evolving workforce.  In our District we need to move towards vocational training which is already on an upswing. School District 211 for example has an award-winning nationally recognized program for vocational education but we need to do more. We need to make community colleges free for those 16+ that have graduated from High School. Harper College currently offers programs to ensure that education is accessible and affordable so that people can improve their education and job skills but we need to do more.  I will focus on the Economy and making Education affordable and I will also concentrate on Womens Rights and affordable Healthcare in the State but most importantly this District.  I plan to host health fairs twice a year where one will concentrate on Womens Health with speakers from local Healthcare providers and a second where I will work with local organizations to offer free drive-up STI testing drives for those 14- to 28-year-olds. Affordable and accessible healthcare is important to me.  A focus that I have is on helping the marginalized feel empowered to make strong confident decisions to be successful in life.  It is this importance of social equality to where I bring my life experience towards helping others hold themselves accountable and responsible in the areas in life which can be controlled through their own abilities and talents and work on identifying areas out of their control to try and find methods to take back that control.  As a political moderate I would oppose political changes which would result in a significant shift of society strongly to either the left or the right.  I also understand how the LGBTQ African American Asian American Hispanic-American and other marginalized communities feel disenfranchised and vulnerable because these groups are statistically less likely to be in full-time employment and much more likely to face barriers in accessing employment have less opportunities for employment or have to leave a job due to discrimination.  To that end a big focus on my campaign and my hope for our area in general is improving racial relations. There has been a lot of tension particularly in the last year or so during the pandemic revolving around race.  From George Floyds death to anti-Asian comments regarding the origins of the pandemic the crisis at our Southern Border and more I believe it is in our collective best interests to better improve these relations in this district Illinois and across the country.  There is still work to be had so that these marginalized groups of people have the basic rights of everyone around them.  I support Unions. This area of the State is known for being Union-friendly because we know the stability a Union provides for wages and benefits that help bring people out of poverty.  I will advocate for policies that benefit our District and State in a bipartisan consensus rather than having conflict with political opponents acting as a check and balance on legislation that I feel is too far to the right or too far to the left on the political spectrum.  If elected the day I arrive in Springfield I will collaborate with freshmen and incumbent Representatives to propose legislation to build policy proposals into law.  Thank you and I would be humbled to receive your vote!  #District54 #KingForIL54 #BDrewKing #Democrat",political,Facebook
Its Labor Day weekend! Before we celebrate let us remember the significance of the holiday: the American Labor Movement. Workers are the unsung heroes that drive our economy and progress starts from the bottom up. When we invest in our workers we invest in our families and neighbors and our economy. The main reason America has reasonable labor standards such as minimum wage five-day workweeks child labor laws etc. is because labor unions have fought for them throughout history and right down to the present day. We need leaders who will prioritize workers when considering legislation. Make sure you thank a worker today and I wish everyone a safe and happy Labor Day weekend!,political,Facebook

"A lot of noise during a campaign season but the facts cannot be changed despite that noise.  We have the lowest tax rate we have ever had. We have the first ever ""no new revenue"" tax rate. We have had the biggest 4 year high paying job and business property tax base growth in our history. We have become the safest city our size over 100000 in the State. We have achieved and maintained the highest bond rating we have ever had. We have achieved and maintained the highest Government Transparency 5 Star Award. We have brought the AT&T Byron Nelson and NCAA Division II Football Championship to McKinney for the next 5 years fostering more tourism and bringing an international spotlight to our City. We have turned the airport from requiring city subsidy to being profitable. We have been named a Cultural Arts District and Music Friendly City by The Governor fostering more tourism.  I am proud to be endorsed by some of the strongest most influential conservative republicans including Sherriff Terry Box Paul and Judy Pogue Judy Gay Richard Dobson Robb Temple and so many others. And I am equally proud to be endorsed by some of the strongest Democrats in our community. It is not about party but about community. I also extremely proud to be endorsed by the Police Association Fire Association Realtor Association McKinney Team and the Home Builder Association. The things we have achieved over the past 4 years speak louder than all the rhetoric and hyperbole.  Thank you Rainey Rogers   Rick Franklin and Angela Richardson-Woods for serving with me. We have together achieved some of our greatest years in this City and all during a pandemic social unrest and a crashed economy.

Investing in Nixa's future!  We all may have other things on our minds as we head into fall (back-to-school Friday night football or an upcoming election) but there is nothing like a good annual budget conversation to get our focus back to the critical issues in our community. Over the last 10 years City Council has worked hard to put Nixa in a solid financial position. Our careful planning helped the municipal government be able to navigate the financial challenges presented by the pandemic and to be ready to grow as we move forward. One of the key elements of our plan has been an over 80% reduction in the City's debt since 2011 - from $23.3 million in 2011 to only $4 million at the end of 2020. City Council has also invested in growing our local economy. Without raising Nixas sales tax rate at all in the last decade Nixa has seen a 65% increase in our general sales tax revenue over these same 10 years which proves stronger total sales by businesses located inside our city limits. In fact our local businesses have shown collective sales growth each year since 2010 including a 14% increase in 2020 and 12% increase so far in 2021. The biggest ticket items this tax revenue pays for are police and streets. These good numbers dont even take into account the addition of the local Use Tax approved by Nixa voters in 2018. The Use Tax was not a new tax nor an increase to the Sales Tax. Rather the Use Tax extended the same city sales tax rate (1.5%) so that it now also applies to purchases made from the giant online stores just as it always has for brick-and-mortar stores here in town. This finally put local businesses on a level playing field as they compete against those giant online stores which used to have an unfair price advantage because they didnt have to charge local sales tax (despite the fact their delivery trucks use our city streets and our police had to investigate if packages were stolen from porches). Now as the pandemics financial repercussions have cut key revenue streams (such as the interest we earn on money in the bank) thanks to that 2018 vote the Use Tax revenue has balanced out those losses. Despite the rapid growth of our citys population (over 4200 new residents since 2010) our slow-but-steady revenue growth and restraint in spending have allowed us to keep up with the increased costs needed to make sure the city doesnt sacrifice the quality of our public services as we stretch to serve more people than ever. We didnt just keep up we also made investments to improve existing services and fully staff the Nixa Police Department. On top of that we even saved some money for future park improvements as well as economic development projects aimed at helping local businesses succeed so they can bring more good jobs to Nixa. Along with the funding provided by the American Rescue Plan for local governments Nixa has never been in a better position financially. This year I will work with Council to utilize these resources to invest in Nixa's future. Some projects under consideration include major park upgrades funding regional water and wastewater infrastructure projects allowing for continual improvement of our police department and investing in technology and automation - all of which will reinforce Nixas reputation as one of the most innovative cities in Missouri. If you are interested in learning more about these plans or want to be part of the City's budget process I hope to see you at a council meeting this fall.,political,Facebook

Hi everyone  Below are my priorities as a Folsom City Council member.  1. A balanced budget is my top priority as a Folsom City Council member. The City of Folsoms 2019-2020 budget began strong but with the COVID19 pandemic the economy turned downwards with the stay at home orders and the closure of non-essential businesses. These economic effects have resulted in a $5.8 million deficit in the actual budget. The City of Folsom elected to use $5.5 million from the $17 million reserve fund to balance the budget. I promise to ensure that all future budgets are balanced and essential services are funded.  2. Public Safety Departments are my second priority as a Folsom City Council member. I will ensure that the Folsom City Police and Fire Department resources are supported and funded.  3. Small Businesses are my third priority as a Folsom City Council member. The COVID19 pandemic has devastated small businesses in the City of Folsom. Restaurants bars salons barbershops and personal care businesses have been hit the hardest forcing a lot of non-essential businesses to close permanently. I will support all small business and try to find solutions to assist these businesses during the COVID19 pandemic.  There are a lot more issues to address in the City of Folsom but these are my top three priorities. I plan on developing solutions for all issues in the City of Folsom by collaborating with subject matter experts the city manager department leaders city council members and citizens of Folsom.  Thank you for your support  Justin Sanders Folsom City Council Candidate,political,Facebook
"MIGRANTS AND CAPITALISM  I read yet another report of the conditions facing migrants in confinement centers in the U.S. and throughout Europe. There is no reason to repeat the conditions as most of you are aware of the situation. I am struck however by the self-obsession of the residents of the various nation's and the anger these residents display towards the migrants.  Not only does this reflect a complete disregard or lack of knowledge of the historical circumstances which have created the migrant's plight it also reflects the narcissistic disease inherent to the capitalist model. Capitalism is built on the assumption that the world is best advanced when individuals act solely in their material self-interest. Not only does this assumption violate most religious traditions it violates common sense as well. But with this justification a certain moral halo surrounds the self-interested economic actor who not only advances his or her own position but also that of their families and by default the rest of the world--so the theory goes. Armed with this moral certainty the capitalist participant condemns and reviles the migrant whose plight is the result of the capitalist spirit of self-seeking endeavor as the migrant's presence may disturb their self-interested efforts.  There is no empathy: there is no time for this or for consideration of the historical events which have created the current conditions there is only time to produce and consume preferably more of the latter than the former. This self-centeredness results in individuals which elevate the worship of excessive consumption over the welfare of fellow human beings. This justifies hatred violence and dehumanization to be directed towards the migrant.  It all becomes structural as many industries evolve which cater to excessive consumption e.g. excessive restaurant and leisure excessive industrial capacity in luxury and excessive clothing excessive home sizes excessive gadgets and so forth. These industries become integral to the national economies; incomes become dependent on these industries and industries become dependent on the incomes. In order to stay afloat or prosper the private firm bombards us with the consumption gospel which enables the firm adequate sales which further enables the payment of ownership profits debt service overhead and wages and which further promotes the materialistic value system. Excessive consumption is necessary to support the unneeded industry which provides employment and income under the private sector arrangement.  It all reinforces itself to the point where the promotion of luxury and excessive consumption becomes necessary in order to protect the survival of the private sector firm and by extension the supporting financial industry employment and the broader national economy. So while some members of society gorge themselves on oversized steaks and lobster deemed morally acceptable in the maximum consumption model and also necessary in order to protect the economic structure migrants suffer and others remain mired in homelessness and hunger. Luxury and excessive consumption become more important than the struggles of migrant families or the homeless in Austin Detroit the West Coast tech cities and elsewhere.  The moral justification which stems from the obviously misguided belief that self-interested economic behavior ""lifts all ships"" is further flawed by the unstated assumption that maximum consumption equals maximum wellbeing. Never mind that maximum consumption a foundational goal of the capitalist model takes no account of distributional issues i.e. 10% percent of the population could consume near everything produced but this would be deemed a good thing so long as the overall consumption was greater than if consumption had been more evenly distributed.  But setting this objection aside the capitalist model is further flawed by the unspoken assumption that maximum consumption equals maximum well-being. It does not. If it did then the U.S. which brazenly displays gobs of frivolous consumption among the middle classes and upwards ought to be a happy place. But it is not a happy place. The Right and the Left are at each other's throats; people are homeless getting sick in order to support unneeded consumption shooting at each other and suffer from a host of other National ills.  Why? Because we are self-obsessed: there is no concern for others there is no empathy only an empty soul-sapping desire to consume and in the process it is the migrant the poor the homeless and the hungry who are consumed. We can never consume enough and to get more if we have to trample on others it's fine it's all been morally justified in the immoral model of capitalism.",political,Facebook

I work to deliver for you and our district. On education: During the pandemic I supported funding 100% of the per-student formula which is the states contribution to local schools regardless of virtual or in-person instruction. And in the last session I also supported adding $763 million to public education which was the largest K-12 investment in Indiana history. Also 94% of Indiana teachers received an average raise of $2160 per teacher in 2019.  On quality-of-life issues: I supported doubling the penalties for those irritating robocalls you get. So while my opponent has her campaign text you on your cellphone I have always done the hard work since 2015. On jobs. The economy. COVID-19. Education. Healthcare. Energy. Life. And constitutional issues. For District 62 and the great Hoosier state.  Vote on or before Nov. 3.  Thanks Jeff.,political,Facebook
While Socialism is generally considered to be the antithesis of Conservatism there is a case to be made by Paternalistic Conservatives for a socialistic economy. Socialism advocates for the welfare and prosperity of all human beings through control of the means of production by the labor force and the abolition of the free-market economy with its boom and bust cycle. While the free-market economy has led to great advances in human progress it has left many millions of people both in the United States and the rest of the world destitute by allowing a few to control the flow of capital and deprive the many of the full fruits of their labor. Its boom and bust cycle leaves millions exposed to hardship when the market collapses. By abolishing the free market and democratizing ownership of the means of production and by implementing controls on prices and production Socialism eliminates the risk factor inherent to free-market economies and ensures that all laborers can enjoy the fruits of their labor. Paternalistic Conservatives especially those who adhere to the teachings of Jesus Christ should consider Socialism as a necessary replacement for our Capitalist economy. This page advocates for a new form of socialism which allows for private ownership of property and more direct labor ownership of production and services rather than en-masse nationalization of production. For example this pages plan for electric utilities is not to form a single national system owned wholly by the government but rather to break up private electric utilities into regional user-owned cooperatives. Franklin Delano Roosevelts Rural Electrification Act set the precedent for this in this country; the legacy of the REA remains in the form of numerous regional electric cooperatives across the United States. However the majority of electric utilities in this country remain in private hands and this page advocates for these private utilities to be turned into user-owned cooperatives. On the front of agriculture this page advocates for all farms to be in the hands of family farmers rather than the more typical Socialist collective farms. This page also advocates for the breakup of corporate-owned farms and for them to be handed over to individual owners. State-controlled cooperatives would collect the majority of agricultural goods in order to be distributed domestically or to be sold or distributed abroad; members of the cooperative would then be reimbursed according to the amount which they produced. Farmers would also have the option to sell up to 25 percent of their production directly to retailers subject to variation based on the type of agricultural good. We advocate for private control of most retail with workers having fair representation on the boards of all companies in the field; in addition retailers would be subject to state-issued price controls and sales guidelines. More details on the economic plan this page advocates for will be discussed further in later posts. Finally this page advocates for socially conservative values such as an emphasis on the traditional nuclear family abolition of abortion discouragement of sexual immorality temperance nullification of homosexual civil unions banning of obscenity and freedom of speech thought religion and the press. This page also advocates for full equality of all citizens regardless of sex ethnicity sexual orientation religion or political affiliation. In addition we advocate for mandatory ownership of firearms by all households for defense against enemies both foreign and domestic. This page also advocates for the replacement of democracy with a paternalistic dictatorship of the proletariat subject to a restrictive constitution and the American Bill of Rights of 1791. In conclusion we believe that Socialism is fully compatible with Conservatism and with Christianity as well as with American founding ideals and we hope to encourage the establishment of a Socialist system in the United States of America.,political,Facebook
Im afraid.3 years flying Combat in Southeast Asia.no fear.3 years of jumping out of aircraft with the Rangers.no fear.now I am afraid very afraid.

Our generation the Boomers were born out of World War II where our parents fought against Naziism and Imperialism we survived the Cold War against Communism and we fight Terrorism.  The Choice: The Known where we were before January 2020. The Unknown where we will be if we reject the Known and choose the Alternative.  The next few years are critical to recovery of our economy.

GREENS IN THE LEGISLATURE I promote impeccable environmental stewardship as the imperative to stimulate our state economy. As a member of a House Green Independent minority caucus I would offer a unique perspective and political disposition that is not born from the competing left-right liberal-conservative Democratic-Republican duality that plays to fear in order to maintain majority control of government by one of two parties. Legislative rules allow certain privileges to minority party caucuses and in this sense as a member of another caucus I would have opportunity to influence budget decisions and special sessions in a manner that a usual Democrat or Republican could not. My focus is to represent my collective constituency the best I can regardless of the labels of liberalism or conservatism.,political,Facebook
The United States has become a centrally planned economy-  For many decades the United States has been an industrial based free market economy outperforming every nation in that arena.  Now the United States has become a financialized economy (currency that has been created out of thin air and funneled to banks and Wall Street corporations by the Federal Reserve) and not into the real economy.  So our economy in essence if not in fact is now run and operated by the Federal Reserve and the commercial banking system-an oligarchic comradeship that buys political favors in exchange for campaign funding and propping itself up with near zero interest loans no matter how insolvent and too big to fail.  Americans have to wake up to the transfer of wealth that is happening right under our noses. Less than one percent own 87% of the stock market and the amount of money that is being funneled into the markets is astronomical and this doesn't even include the Federal Reserve purchases of mortgage backed securities totaling billions of dollars per month.  Our economy has been financialized. It no longer relies on production. It relies on speculation and stock purchases along with propping up real estate prices that benefit the banks.  The people lose the financial oligarchy wins. In many ways the American people have been bamboozled.,political,Facebook

My name is Jill Gumble and I'm asking for your vote in becoming the city council representative for the North West district.  I moved to Hutchinson in 1996 and married Mitch Gumble in 1997. We have 3 grown children and 4 grandchildren. In 1997 I began my real estate career with Astle Realty now known as Plaza Astle Realty Inc. and worked for 15 years with Realty Executives 4Results. In 2000 my husband and I started a local retail furniture and appliance store and we are still in business today. In 2002 we purchased our first rental property and currently own numerous quality affordable rentals throughout Hutchinson.  I have served with the following organizations and boards: I was an Ambassador with the Chamber of Commerce I served on the Board of Directors for the Hutchinson Board of Realtors I was involved in the development of the City of Hutchinson Landlord/Tenant handbook and I'm currently the President of the Central Kansas Landlords Association.  While my background is heavy in housing and real estate I also fully understand the financial challenges a new business faces when considering opening their doors. The cost of a new mortgage insurance inventory and labor can become overwhelming. But when faced with Hutchinson's restrictive building codes and requirements high property taxes and the additional expense of the Storm Water Utility fees ....the obstacles become burdensome and less cost effective. The numerous vacant commercial properties in our town are a direct reflection of the obstacles being too much for a new business to budget and justify. Our city MUST become more welcoming and supportive of any individual or company wanting to invest their money into our community.  My main focus is to partner with The Chamber of Commerce to bring in new business create new jobs to creates new sources of revenue for our city. Additionally we must continue to make allowances for a strong and viable infrastructure. Core services must be protected and funded FIRST when establishing our city's budget. This includes making sure our first responders have the supplies and resources they need to work safely and effectively.  I've invested my money and efforts into the city of Hutchinson. And I believe in Hutchinson's abilities to become a stronger community. It's time to make Hutchinson strong again. And with a stronger economy we will build a stronger community.  I thank you for your consideration and would greatly appreciate your support along with your vote in November.,political,Facebook
THE 'CLOWN' IN THE WHITE HOUSE  The 'clown' in the White House has brokered two Middle East Peace Accords something that 70+ years of political intervention by countless previous administrations and endless wars failed to produce.  The 'clown' in the White House is the first president since Eisenhower who has NOT engaged us in a foreign war.

The clown in the White House significantly improved the veterans' care by the VA which had been either ignored or ineffective under previous administrations.  The 'clown' in the White House has had the greatest impact on the economy in the last 40 years by bringing jobs back to the U.S. and lowering unemployment for the female black and latino populations of ANY other president. Ever.  The clown in the White House has exposed the deep widespread and long-standing corruption in the FBI the CIA the NSA and the Republican and Democratic parties.  The clown in the White House turned NATO around and had them start paying their dues.  The clown in the White House turned our relationship to the Chinese around brought hundreds of business back to the U.S. and revived the economy. Hello!  The clown in the White House has replaced the NAFTA disaster with a more equitable USMCA although he was told it could not be done.  The clown in the White House has accomplished the life-time appoints of two Supreme Court Justices and close to 300 Federal Judges.  The clown in the White House lowered your taxes and caused your stock market to move to record levels over 100 times which positively impacted the retirements of tens of millions of citizens.

The clown in the White House WORKS FOR FREE and has lost well over 2 billion dollars of his own money in serving.  He has done ALL OF THIS AND MUCH MORE in the face of relentless undermining and opposition from people who are threatened because they know they are going to be exposed as the criminals that they are if he is re-elected.  I get it you don't like him. How special of you! He is serving you and ALL the American people. What are you doing -- besides denying his accomplishments calling him names and supporting self-centered power-hungry corrupt politicians?  Author unknown. Copied and Pasted,political,Facebook
"Here is a preview of a questionaire I sent back to the Fertile Journal today should run in the next week or so!  1. Why did you choose to run for County Commissioner?  I have been thinking about entering public office when I was going through my military retirement process. When I ran into some issues with zoning that kind of galvanized me to run at the county commissioner level. When I went to the commission to ask questions as to why they needed as much room as a setback as they were requiring they really could not answer me and were trying to kick the responsibility to a lower committee. As the Commissioners they are the ones who approve the zoning regulations that just did not set well with me that they did not even offer to get back with me for a more detailed answer it was like I was an interruption of their work and not the purpose of it. I did not feel they really listened to my concerns and in my mind they refused to take responsibility for ordinances they were responsible as a body for approving so I figured if I did not like the way it was going then I could either just sit back and complain or I could run and try to fix them. I decided to run!  2. What comments can you make about COVID-19 and/or handling of it on the county level?  I feel that the county as a whole has done relatively well with what they had. Truth is the state did not give them the freedom to really have the impact they could have. The one aspect I would like to see improved on is reaching out to the smaller cities like Fertile to see if they could help then with the Cares funding and grant process to small businesses in those cities. The smaller cities just do not have the training or resources to fully be able to take advantage of some of these programs and I feel that the county is only as strong as these smaller towns so it would be in the county's best interest to assist them if possible with CARES funding.  3. What do you foresee as the top three issues (other then COVID-19) confronting Polk County?  Of course from question one you can see I believe zoning and permitting is a potential issue. I manage a northern Mn homesteading group on a poupular social media site and I have seen permit issues come up more then once with people discouraging new homesteaders from considering Polk County due to permitting requirements. My personal experience with that office has been good they try to work with me but they are only enforcing the rules on the books so the question is are we over regulating? My next potential issue I see is sort of related to COVID and there is the short fall in road and bridge funding we will likely experience this year. Without as much travelling and gas usage we are expecting a shortfall in state road funds. This leaves us with two options cut projects or raise local sales taxes or wheelage changes. I do not see the raising of wheelage fees or taxes as an option with the hardship already created by COVID meaning we will have to be good stewards of the road money we do have when selecting funding priorities. The last issue I think we face is growing Polk County. Our small businesses have taken a beating this last year but at the same time we have also identified some needs that can be filled (such as local livestock processors so we are not dependent on the big companies for our food security). Our schools are shrinking as each graduating class is smaller than the previous classes our population has shrunk in Polk county each of the last 4 years and we can not continue on this path. We need to focus on growth!  4. How should the county board handle them?  I think we need to relook at our zoning and permit policies to ensure we can balance the needs of the overall public while not trampling on the people rights to use their property as they see fit. If we are going to restrict our people's ability to use their own property it needs to be for a legitimate need of the public. On the funding issue we need to be up front with the public to manage expectations and figure out if there is somewhere else within the county budget where the money can be reallocated from as roads are probably the one thing no one complains about the country spending money on! The last issue is not an easy fix it will mean doing a better job of marketing polk county it may mean working with the University of Mn- Crookston's Veden Center for Rural Economic Development to develop a plan to strengthen our local economy it could mean developing a tax plan that encourages companies to move to Polk County and to keep some of our recent UMC graduates in this area because they see the chances to grow.  5. If elected what would you like to see the board accomplish in the comming year/years?  I think this question is very closely related to question 4 however I do have one thing in mind. I would like to see every dollar we spend at the county level really looked at to determine if there is a more pressing need for that dollar. Our tax dollars are limited we need to ensure they are being spent in the way that will best support our county and its citizens. No one likes to pay taxes but what we really hate is to see our tax dollars wasted! We want to get the most bang for our buck and for the most part if we are we do not have major issues with paying our taxes. I feel with my finance and budget background this is an area I am very strong in.  6. What do you most want voters to know about you as a commissioner candidate?  With me I feel what you see is what you get. I try to bring in a common sense approach to issues. If you listened to me speak at the candidate forum this week you probably noticed I was not the most polished with my public speaking but there was no doubt I spoke with passion as these are all topics that are important to me. I do not do lip service I strongly believe that the hard right is better than the easy wrong every time. From my years as an Non-Commissioned Officer in the army that was probably one of my favorite bullet points I ever received on my evaluations because I feel it speaks directly to my character.  7. Any additional Information/comments?  After 20 years in the military I still feel that desire to serve to be a part of something bigger than myself of being a leader that can make things better for others. As a veteran I am often told ""Thank you for your Service"" it is a sentiment I am grateful for but I often wonder if they know they are thanking me for something that I really did not have a choice about it was sort of ingrained in me from a child that I wanted to serve my country I see this opportunity to be county commissioner a chance to continue my service. While I am not originally from here (I am originally from SW Louisiana put it this way New Orleans is NORTH of where I grew up!) my wife the former Terri Weber grew up between Fertile and Crookston and we do spend a lot of time in Fertile as I am a frequent customer at TDS Feed and Grain and go to Church there. We have three children Christopher who is a Senior at UND studying Mechanical Engineering Alexis is graduated from the University of Mn-Twin cities in with a Liberal Arts degree and Jamee who is a senior at Crookston High school. When we retired we moved to a 8 acer homestead off of State Hwy 9 in Beltrami and started a small livestock farm on 40 acres we got from her parents. We currently raise belted galloway cattle (Oreo cows!) swine Kinder goats and Poultry and practice sustainable farming techniques. Besides my experaince working with finance and Budget in the Army I also bring a BA in Human Resources  a Masters in International Relations (Conflict Resolution concentration) to the table along with currently studying Animal Science at UMC. I hope this has at least shown you a little of my vision of the future and that you will consider me when you vote this year. Thank you very much.",political,Facebook
As most of you know I have decided to run a traditionally funded campaign. If I'm going to represent you in Augusta I want it to be a result of hard work not because the state provided the funds and it didn't cost me anything. It would be easy to collect a bunch of $5 donations and have your tax dollars (clean election funds) kick in the rest. I am not condemning people who choose to use these funds but personally I believe the money could be better used especially in times such as these. In order for us to pull through the economic devastation caused by our state government's response to this pandemic there will have to be cuts and I believe politicians should lead by example. Our elderly veterans and disabled must be off limits to cuts of any kind. There are help wanted signs every where you go and many business owners I have talked to are desperate for help. If we can safely connect unemployed people with these businesses we can get our economy generating the tax revenues our state needs badly. I believe our economy can be better than before if we get the government out of the way of hard working Maine people. With your support I want to take my business experience to Augusta and fight to make this happen. One of the best ways you can show your support is by allowing me to put a sign in your yard. I also have a limited supply of T-shirts for anyone in my district. E-mail me @ mcarmichaelforme@gmail.com or message me on this page and I will get one to you! God Bless,political,Facebook
Hello my name is Kevin Mosher. I am asking for your vote as I run for my second term on the Sitka Assembly. During my first campaign I promised to work to decrease the cost of local government to foster sound fiscal management of city resources and to help Sitka businesses grow by supporting our maritime industries fostering year-round tourism and leveraging Sitkas historical and cultural resources. Three years ago none of us could have predicted the impact that the pandemic would have on our local economy and government. While COVID-19 created enormous fiscal challenges for residents businesses and the City I feel that my work on the Assembly put us in a better position to respond and recover from the pandemic than we were when I started. I advocated for new leadership in City Hall and emphasized the importance of experience in management and budgeting. We made reductions to the City budget. And we hired a lobbyist in D.C. after many years without a voice in our nations capital. The most important thing Ive learned in my first term is the value of teamwork. I have good relationships and open lines of communication with all of my fellow Assembly members and our town administrator. We are pushing hard to get projects completed that could increase City revenue which in turn will help residents. If re-elected I will continue to advocate for fiscal responsibility and economic growth positively collaboratively as a member of a team!,political,Facebook
"I had posted this on my blog on blogspot back in 2012 it is still valid and probably more appropriate who didn't see this coming. We s ho would have known. tombstone001  IT IS NOT HOW I SAY YOU SHOULD LIVE IT IS NOT HOW I WANT YOU TO LIVE BUT THIS THE WAY YOU WILL LIVE  Saturday June 23 2012  OUR PROBLEMS  06/23/2012  OUR PROBLEMS  No doubt our anything goes mind set along with the feel good psychology and NOT the least our feel good faiths and religions have directly contributed to our down fall and short comings as persons families and the nations.  We have failed to see our faults and failed see our down fall. We failed to heed any warnings. No doubt those who knew the political the psychological and the religious people that should have been warning us of our disastrous choices only found it to their personal benefit to let us go astray to use us for their own personal benefit or worse to divide us among groups to further their personal agendas.  If we just focused on ourselves and fixed our own ""personal"" lives instead of trying to be ""liked"" and being ""approved of"" by someone else where we could really be?  Sadly few are willing to give up power and privilege without using force without being confronted with force. As what happened with the Arab spring is the same as what is happening in the US and Europe. The opposition to the ruling classes is fractured mostly directionless and without any credible leadership. With such the ruling classes with their grips on power is not shaken. As I have been saying"" before you start a revolution you better know what you will do when you get it"". Masses in Egypt have no better clue about what they will do if granted power than either the ""TEA party or the OWS. They just know they don't like what is happening and want change but what change and how will it solve their problems? Religious fundamentalist are just as lost as are the socialist and the TEA Party. Che was screwed up as everyone else is today. To sustain power you must be willing to use it also. The Communist have done that and so have the Fascists the kings and others.  As we keep referring to history for guidance we tend to lose sight of this basic simple fact that the humanity the technology the economy the politics even the world itself has changed from even just as far back as fifty years ago. Looking at the world today thru a prism of the past is only confusing and misleading us as we face the challenges and the hurdles that were never known to us a mere few years ago. It is time for us not to back up but to understand the world as it exists today so we can face the ""NEW PARADIGM"".  Whoever said ""I think therefore I am'"" was talking about thinking at a logical and conscience level thus to prove their awareness of self and existence. Most people are not ""THINKING"" at that level yet.  We have shown many animals to be able to ""think"" does that mean that we can prove they are "" aware"" of their existence also I must suppose not that their thinking must be at the ""id"" level only as is with most humanity. As it is with the gorillas the dolphins and someone being shot at or hungry.  We the "" Western Whites"" ( I am not white but reflecting on the majority mindset) also give ourselves too much credit for our thinking ability. In truth we live at the imbecile level mostly along with the starving masses of Africa the terrorists of Islam and the drug lord everywhere! A dog salivating a dolphin jumping out of water a terrorist bombing a crowd of worshippers a drug lord ordering a hit a Kardashian releasing a sex tape are they all ""thinking"" therefore they ""ARE""?  And how is any of it different than say Obama ordering murders by drones or say Rumsfeld and Blair lying about WMDs? Or say Romney laying off thousands to make extra money. We give our thinking ability too much credit without ever using it. Most of us exist at an animal level only never growing out of our id phase. People in starving countries continue to breed as do the unemployed and those in the West living on assistance.  The so called liberals and the greens who claim to care for the planet and the conservatives who claim to love everyone and care for the people keep using resources that ""need"" be shared by "" all"". You can say you think therefore you are but I respectfully disagree. Most people are not capable of thinking.  While we watch the ""Kardshians""' "" The Real Housewives""  ""Teen Mom"" ""Tots in Tiaras"" and similar fare for entertainment should we also wonder sometimes how much entertainment our own lives are providing those that watch us and we are not even getting paid.  Listening to the same stuff day in and day out and regurgitating it does not make you more intelligent and knowledgeable it proves you an ignorant and a dumb. Learn to study for yourself and to THINK!  LIFE IS A GAME OF CONNECT THE DOTS IF YOU DON'T CONNECT ALL THE DOTS OR DON'T CONNECT THEM IN THE RIGHT ORDER YOU NEVER GET THE PICTURE  Posted by The Prophet at 11:46 PM  No comments:",political,Facebook
