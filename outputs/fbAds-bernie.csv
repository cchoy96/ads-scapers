If you put all the pieces together here's what you get. The DNC rigs the Democratic Primary Election against Bernie Sanders so Hilliary can win the nomination. Obama's administration starts to request surveillance on Trump his family his transition team and anyone associated with him. Donna Brazil gives Hilliary the questions to a debate. The DNC pays Christopher Steele to come up with a smear dossier about Trump. The mainstream media releases a taped conversation about Trump talking about grabbing women parts. After all this Trump still wins the General Election. Obama orders an investigation into Russia meddling in our elections. Obama changes Executive Order 12333 to allow more agencies to have access to surveillance data. The Democratic Party comes up with a scandal that Trump Colluded with Russia to win the election with no evidence or proof. This wild claim is backed up by the mainstream media. Obama hold overs start unmasking Trump's transition team and staff members then release the classified information to the mainstream media. Why? Because the DNC and the Obama administration colluded with the intelligence community to thwart Trump's campaign efforts to get him elected president. All this Russia collusion is an attempt to cover up the fact that the Obama administration the intelligence community the DNC along with the mainstream media used our nations surveillance as a political tool to try to get Hilliary elected President. This makes Watergate look like a kindergarten play. Let that sink in.......,political,Facebook

This week Bernie Sanders said that terrorists and rapists should be allowed to vote in our elections. The left thinks the prisoners should be choosing our presidents.  Jim Hood is with them. Last week he admitted his support for letting felons vote. He said that I think that the votes are there to actually restore peoples right to vote. He called it important. He told his supporters: Those of you who know somebody that has been charged with a felony encourage them to go register.  What do you think? Should terrorists be able to vote? And do you agree with Jim Hoods effort to register more felons and restore their voting rights?,political,Facebook
Fidel Castro was an enemy of John F. Kennedy. There are many who believe Castro had a hand in JFKs assassination and even if he didn't he had a plan for it you can be sure. JFK invaded Cuba to try to remove Castro. And Bernie Sanders has the audacity to stand up and defend the good that Castro did. Bernie its disgusting get off the stage.,political,Facebook
A Split Democratic Party and a Quiet Plea  Division within the Democratic party is at an all time high. Those under the age of 45 have a drastically different set of core values and aspirations than those over 45. The age split on votes in every state shows a clear difference in their preferred candidate.  The older Democrats desperately want to focus on Beating Trump and are trying to push Biden forward as the presidential nominee. They view him as a sure ticket due to the popularity of the previous administration and the unpopularity of the current one.  The younger generations want to use this tumultuous and inept presidency as an opportunity to nominate the only candidate promising radical change- Bernie Sanders. They are drawn to his honesty consistency and fearless nature. They view him as a refreshing change of pace from the calculated and propped-up existence that typically characterizes politicians in the US.  Where we agree:  The Trump presidency is criminal and a problem for America no matter how you package it. You can cherry-pick positives if you want but it doesnt change that fact.  We need to restore dignity to our Nation and implement positive change.  Older Generation truths that the youth do not agree with:  Trump and his administration are the cause of this hardship  Much of the youth believe that the entire modern political system is to be blamed. Money in politics has buried the voice of a vast majority. Neither side has done a great job of representing the interests of your average person. This is likely a contributing factor to the perpetuation of the youth dont vote adage and reality. If you do not believe your government is capable of doing anything for you you dont find reason to vote. Dont let them fall further into this sense of powerlessness.  The totality of a mans career is of little importance relative to what he will do or is capable of doing  The young dont have the luxury of ignoring red flags in a politicians career. Im sure Biden today is a much more kind empathetic and honorable man than he was when he was advocating for cuts of social programs. I would bet everything in my bank account that he is. Even still knowing that he has done so undermines much of the trust one could have that he will truly fight for the least among us. Bernies record enables a level of trust that isnt possible with Biden.  The common argument against Bernie lies in his capacity to get things done. This line of thinking falls apart with one glance at Trump. If a man who had little/no experience in politics and limited critical thinking skills could force through sweeping legislature at the rate he does: why couldnt Bernie do something similar with the ideals of the 99% being his guiding principles? Sure he wasnt a wizard in the Senate- but thats the Senate. Gridlock is its natural state. Legislation that doesnt result in a payday for monetary interests rarely sees any traction. A president however doesnt have to be a middle of the aisle type guy to be effective: in fact it can be argued that being that guy only leads to watered down half-measures that accomplish very little of what it originally sought to.  Biden is more electable than Bernie Bernie could never win etc.  The number of voters over 45 turning out for the primary is impressive. I am glad you are all exercising your rights as you always have. You understand the importance of making your voice heard with action. This should not however give you the power to (once again) ignore the cries of those who need radical change to simply live. Medical debt student debt climate crisis. We are chained in every aspect of our lives and cannot live. America is supposed to be a land of freedom yet the youth are screaming: We are not free.  Biden is not Obama. Obama was the automatic win due to the overwhelming black vote (of all ages and demographics). The only way it was even close with Obama was in the primary (and here we are again). Democrats almost stopped Obama more than anyone else. This time you are attempting to nominate a candidate with a core voting-base that shares a lot of demographic crossover with Trump. Its not the same game.  A plea from me a painfully average member of the 99%:  Consider Bernie as the candidate to unite behind.  I know it can feel like you dont need to listen to the loud and angry/sad/rude people on the internet (or in person) telling you how bad things are and all of the things they need. Things you may not have been given in your youth. Especially when it feels like they dont vote and arent helping you win an election. No one likes losing. This last election cycle has made us especially afraid of losing. But theres more at stake here than just a presidency: for the youth its our entire outlook and hopes for life and our government. We are loud every chance we get because its the only way we feel our voice will be heard. We are scared. We want to be able to ask for more from the people that are supposed to represent our desires as citizens. We want to be proud to be Americans not because of vague nostalgia (MAGA) but because of what we can create together in the modern era. We need radical change and together we can get it done. When you have someone who is truly fighting for the 99% like Bernie is he will get things done and he will win the general. Trust in inspire and lift up your fellow man rather than try to entice the republican base with compromise. Biden will retain some of the youth and may even win the general but you will kneecap the party going forward.  Please...listen to the youth. Give us a voice in this primary and we will be the frontlines of the movement to secure this general because you listened and heard us. Downplay and ignore our concerns and we return to our rooms- focusing on getting that next paycheck to make sure were okay come next week. If were in this together behind Bernie we will not lose. Please stand with the youth and cast your vote for Bernie.  Thank you for reading this. It means a lot more to me than I could ever really communicate. I wish you and your family the best in these difficult times. Stay safe happy and healthy if at all possible. Were in this together.  Thank you again.

"SPOKE BEFORE THE DAVIDSON COUNTY MEN'S CLUB IN LEXINGTON AND WOULD WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK BEFORE YOUR GROUP  Today (Saturday March 7) I had the opportunity to speak before the Davidson County Republican Men's Club in Lexington North Carolina. I spoke about Socialism's advances in America. It's alarming - very alarming.  Dr. Paul Kengor an author and professor of political science at Grove City College in Pennsylvania someone who has written often about Socialism and Communism says: ""Socialism is in Marxist theory the final transitory step to Communism."" He's right.  I don't intend to take it up at length here but let me just say I think most conservatives and patriots don't expect Bernie Sanders to become the next President of the United States. But the fact that a Democratic Socialist (which is essentially no different a title than the way Vladimir Lenin referred to himself in the early years of the Communist Party) can become a prominent contender for the Presidency not once but twice should have us shaking in our boots.  THE THREAT TO LIBERTY IS MORE URGENT THAN MOST PEOPLE UNDERSTAND  I believe we need to be talking about this subject and exposing the evils of this system - a system of government that will bankrupt us morally and materially. Because I believe everything about socialism is anti-Christian as a minister of the Gospel of Christ I would welcome the opportunity to speak to both political groups and churches about it.  Please private message me if you have an interest in arranging a speaking engagement. Email me at: office@christianactionleague.org  I am so humbled by every opportunity to share with others the hope we have in Christ. I am so thankful that we need not stumble our way through the darkness of life. Traditional Christian teaching with the Holy Scriptures as our infallible guide will provide more than enough light to lead us to personal happiness and political prosperity.  -Dr. Mark H.

God Bless America - Charlie's Soapbox 2/7/2020  The phrase God Bless America is the title of one of the most durable songs in our history and is a part of the lyrics in an unknown number of compositions by American composers in all genres of music.  It is used as the closing remarks by public speakers of all stripes including presidents and lesser politicians.  It is one of the most frequently used complementary closes on personal letters spoken from pulpits openings of sports events and a part of the prayers of millions.  The point is God has blessed America and in my opinion more so than any nation in modern times.  This land bordered by the worlds two major oceans is a microcosm of practically every blessing God has granted to any other nation on earth.  We have the mountains the rivers lakes and forests plains and deserts metropolises and village cold regions hot regions temperature regions fertile agricultural areas swamps thousands of miles of seacoast and the most diverse population on earth.  Rich heritage and culture carried over from countries of origin from the colorful French flavored language and freewheeling lifestyle of the South Louisiana Cajuns to the Midwestern enclaves of the Scandinavians who settled Minnesota and Wisconsin. Little Italy China Town Cherokee Hamtramck where the colorful culture of the ethnic groups who settled there is still observed with festivals and fairs and the food drink and accents still reflect the flavor of the old country.  Beneath our soil and under our oceans there are vast deposits of gold silver copper minerals and diverse chemicals with petroleum reserves to last a century.  America leads the world in so many technological and industrial categories medicine space exploration food production and transportation with a standing army that is second to none the envy of the planet.  Land of the free home of the brave the American Dream the American way the land that has welcomed pilgrims from around the world for over two hundred years.  Yes God has blessed America but greed and lust for power threaten to do something the most formidable military powers and the most contagious political philosophies have not been able to do.  To take down the USA or to change it into a vast pasture full of sheep who have given over control of their lives to a godless totalitarian central government which makes cradle to grave decisions for every man woman and child. A one size fits all bureaucratic nightmare that would dictate every facet of life from who does and who does not get perks and benefits to the number of children each family is allowed to have.  You see this is all about globalism or one-world government and as long as there is a nation that claims to be exceptional and refuses to surrender its sovereignty values the rights of the individual and proclaims its independence to the point of fighting for it there can never be a one-world government.  And since the USA is the most powerful nation on earth as long as we cling to our God and our guns - pun intended - it just aint gonna happen.  So how do you handle an intractable conundrum like America?  Well you do it in increments.  First and foremost you find a way of proselytizing the most vulnerable among us the children.  You form huge influential political organizations like the National Education Association identify some powerful politicians who think their re-election is more important than what our children are being taught make sure their campaign coffers are never empty and proceed to tailor the curriculum to nudge the students in the direction you want them to go.  Then you fill the institutions of higher learning with Marxist professors who subtly convince their young charges that America is not really what it claims to be that it has stolen everything it has and has marginalized and depressed minorities and that its time for America to be cut down to size and the way to do that is to level the playing field to take away from those who have accumulated some degree of wealth by stealing it from those poor unfortunate souls who never had a chance under this unfair form of governance.  Its called socialism and it means that everybody no matter your skills education race creed or work ethic will have the same opportunities with free college free healthcare free childcare a shorter workweek guaranteed lifetime salary and lucrative retirement benefits.  There will also be realignments in the climate change policy we will eliminate fossil fuels and begin a program to convert to all renewable energy sources.  And it will all be paid for by the greedy rich.  Now lets get back to reality  Well first of all if every cent Jeff Bezos Bill Gates Warren Buffet and all the other multi-billionaires was not only taxed but confiscated it would not keep this socialist Shangri-La afloat for six months.  So then after all the rich have been taxed a VAT of 20% added and the government is in debt to the tune of four hundred trillion dollars or so no more credit is available and the American dollar is worth a little less than a dried corn shuck prices of food have gone through the roof and that nasty old gasoline the government promised to get rid of is selling for twenty-five dollars a gallon when you can find it.  And when you find out that tomorrow the government is sending people to put you and your family out in the street because you cant pay the seven hundred thousand dollars you owe on your house and the factory you worked for moved to Guatemala two years ago and your unemployment check has shrunk to two hundred dollars a month and you cant find another job what do you do.  And you think Ill get my guns out and  No you wont because the government which is moving to Brussels confiscated your guns five years ago.  Get the drift? the ship has sailed and youre not on it but dont feel bad because nobody else is on it either except for the people who talked you into this mess to start with and theyre on top of the world penthouses private jets the whole enchilada.  Okay maybe theres a tad of hyperbole and a grain of exaggeration in my prattle but the rock-solid fact remains...  SOCIALISM DOES NOT WORK!  IT NEVER HAS IT NEVER WILL!  Not Karl Marxs version not Fidel Castros version not Bernie Sanders version not the insane version Alexandria Cookie Ocasio-Cortez is pushing not Elizabeth Warrens Pollyanna ramblings that will probably include free pedicures before its over nobody no how no way has ever been successful at socialism.  Check the casualty list.  Start with Venezuela.  What do you think?  Pray for our troops our police and the peace of Jerusalem.  God Bless America  Charlie Daniels,political,Facebook
"TRUMP WANTS WAR!!!! The industrial war machine and the need for oil--something that must end for our survival--will continue to feed the rich as we watch our country slip away from our fingers and we continue to become more like surfs (one step up from a slave) we do all the work and give it all back--we aren't living! We need to take back ""OUR"" Country and defeat the greed! Why the hell must our kids die for the greed of the rich? What do we have to do with war? Iran was following the rules but the rich want more! What happened to the Republican Party? They've lost their f'n minds! Take the rights away from a woman? I thought they wanted to keep government out of our lives? Girl if you don't wanna a kid you don't wanna a kid! You know what these rich people don't realize is that it would make a hard life even harder--mental health age finances--and who pays for it? We do with Medicaid and subsidized housing! Now Biden he's beholden to the rich big donors so far-Left policies will probably not happen like Medicare for all--single payer (remember Biden is Obama's boy--got'a keep the ACA running!) and the fight against fossil fuels at a rate that would save us all. We need a Democrat that want's to invest in ""The People"" and not continue putting up with the greed that has overwhelmed our Government officials. Saying all this I must say I like Bernie more and more. One thing I see about him is that he has great depth very empathetic to needs of the people and how we must defeat the greed--strong policies that will increase our wellness both financially and physically and rebuilding our lives by rebuilding our land. I ask you this: Should we continue to feed the suffering of millions of people including our own on issues that that only benefit the wealthy? War is hell! Or focus on the wellbeing of our homes and our lives? Truly Bernie has a plan that will return our Country to ""us"" and defeat the same thing that destroyed Rome! Stop the greed--Vote for Bernie!

A new poll just out has Ron DeSantis leading Andrew Gillum 48-45% This is a very close race. You can make an impact right now by sharing this post.  5 facts to chew on.....  1) Gillum raised property taxes while Mayor. Do you want your property taxes to go up?  2) Gillum has called for 1 Billion Dollars in new spending and said he would tax Florida businesses to get the money. Do you want Florida jobs to go away?  3) Crime under Andrew Gillum has run rampant in Tallahassee. The murder rate has gone up 52%. Is this the record you want a Governor to have?  4) Gillum signed a manifesto that was against the police force and called for abolishing our prisons. Do you support our men in blue?  5) Gillum is not a moderate Democrat. He is out of the far-left mold of Bernie Sanders and would be the most socialist Governor Florida has ever had. Wherever you are on the political spectrum likely Gillum is to your left.  Ron DeSantis is an Iraq War Veteran. He cares about our environment and was endorsed by the Everglades Trust. He is a father and a husband. He will keep taxes low and continue building our economy in Florida.  Find out more here:,political,Facebook

"WARREN AND SANDERS  Generally I try to avoid politics on this Page but prefer rather to discuss issues of ideology and economics. But I have been thinking about Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.  I would think the capitalist class might find Elizabeth Warren an attractive candidate. She has helped the capitalist class salvage their ideological framework by describing herself as: ""capitalist to my bones"". A Warren presidency would allow the capitalist class to cling-on to their ideological framework while scapegoating the cracks in the system as something other than the inevitable consequence of the system itself. When a system is premised on self-interest rather than global communal interest the inevitable consequence is what we have today. Elizabeth Warren would manage the system in a manner which would cost the capitalist some money but they will at least be able to keep the system and the pillars of belief which maintain its existence.  Bernie Sanders on the other hand whose policies would probably not much differ from the policies of Elizabeth Warren embraces the label ""socialist"". This implies a different value system from the value system of capitalism. Socialism's larger emphasis on the role of communal enterprise inherently undermines individual profit opportunity--at least in the short run. A Bernie Sanders win would seemingly provoke a transformation of American self-perception: an important ingredient on the path to a more equitable world.  I find both candidates to be attractive as an interim step towards a more equitable world. Both candidates from my perspective are somewhat of a compromise but the key is to maintain fidelity to your ideals: express your ideals but recognize that compromise in the political realm might be necessary in order to achieve peaceful transformation.",political,Facebook
"The Democrats meaning Comey Mueller Schiff and Rosenstein and all the CNN host have lied for two years no they are not sorry.  They have new lies. Their job is to mislead the American public that will believe them. It's all they have. Listen to them.  Now they say ""the White House must release the full Mueller Report"" as if the classified redactions are secrets Trump won't release.  Democrats keep calling wolf and only the weak minded believe them.  Even Bernie is demanding transparency. I say... Ok let's get to the bottom of what evidence Mueller had to start with. Thing is there are many ignorant Democrats out there they believe the lies as truth. CNN knows this.  It is the greatest scam in America's history and like Watergate Hillary Rodham Clinton is involved.  Trump stood against the corruption and the conspiracy theorists stood against him. Many Democrats hate the police they call them snitchers or pigs. They hate rules and only join with the liberals for free stuff and drugs. It's the facts jack.

SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE PACKAGE: OH MY  Looks like the MMTers (Modern Monetary Theory people) are losing this round. The social infrastructure package which started off as a $6 trillion Bernie Sanders ambition then shrunk to a $3.5 trillion package is now lingering around $1.75 trillion or so. Various financial analysts think this a big deal but it is not. $1.75 trillion spread over 10 years is a measly $175 billion annually less than one quarter of the U.S. annual military budget. Apparently the powers-that-be believe that a powerful fighting force will gain a greater return on investment than a well-educated civilized people.  Maybe the Democrats could revert to the Sander's $6 trillion package spread it over 100 years and make everyone happy. The progressives could claim victory because they will have gotten a $6 trillion package. The Party's conservative wing could claim victory because they limited the additional spending to $60 billion annually. Even the Republicans would be thrilled because they could point to the $6 trillion number and call the Democrats spendthrifts.  This has got to blow the MMTers away. The Modern Monetary Theory people understand the vast charade which is going on. All the concern about federal debt is nonsense investment in people and physical infrastructure is what will advance the Nation. Debt financed federal deficits is a policy choice it is an accounting convention of which we choose to abide.  As a sovereign nation with its own free floating currency the sovereign the U.S. in our case can create all the money it needs without taxation or borrowing taxation and borrowing are necessary however to prevent inflation in the goods services and asset markets (actually borrowing is never necessary but has other practical applications). With this in mind the U.S. can invest the necessary funds for a strong future nation restrained only by the inflationary impact of such investment. There will be a lag between the investment and the eventual supply of goods and services adequate to meet the additional money created through the investment. This is where the inflation comes in.  If you are worried about the current U.S. debt a large chuck of it $5.5 trillion or so sits on the Federal Reserve's (FEDs) balance sheet and it can be purchased by a platinum coin created by the Treasury Department's U.S. Mint or held in perpetuity by the FED where it is cost free to the U.S. taxpayer or simply extinguished through an Act of Congress in combination with the creation of a new FED intangible asset account to prevent the hit to the FED's balance sheet--a hit which would otherwise eventually pass to the U.S. taxpayer.  Higher government investment will need to crowd out private investment not for lack of investable funds which are virtually infinite but in order to prevent inflation due to excessive investment demand. This of course is why the social infrastructure package is resisted it would be an enlargement of government at the expense of the private sector but I would argue for the benefit of the people and the Nation at large.  The Nation does not need more private sector investment which churns out $15 an hour jobs alongside a growing class of billionaires and millionaires: Elon Musk--$306.5 billion Jeff Bezos--$192.9 billion Warren Buffett--$104.7 billion . . . . The Nation needs investment in human capital which will create good paying jobs and to better distribute corporate gains among the poor and lower middle income groups whose dire straits are the result of an over reliance on the private sector.,political,Facebook

Either our borders mark America as exceptional or they dont matter at all. We need to respect that a border means something.  Nancy Pelosi Chuck Schumer and the rest of the Left try to paint border security in an evil immoral light. Last time I checked protecting our country was not immoral  in fact its just the opposite. Border security keeps us safe and ensures that the rest of the world respects both our boundaries and the rule of law.  And thats not all. The cost would be less than 1/10th of one percent of the budget and the Left is blowing this dramatically out of proportion. Heres some perspective: we wasted $800 billion on a failed stimulus package under President Obama. Bernie Sanders wants us to foot the bill for a $47 billion A YEAR free college program. President Obama authorized $150 billion to Iran. The list goes on an on: failed government programs vacant federal buildings we are still paying for foreign aid to our enemies and more. If we can spend hundreds of billions to try and ensure the health of big banks surely we can spend the smallest fraction of that to ensure our nations health.  Our government is supposed to protect our borders and our people. Thats why Im taking a stand with President Trump to fight for border security.,political,Facebook

Hello again citizens of Reno!  I am coming to you again looking for discussion. I am certain that you the voting public are exhausted from the constant back and forth of the political season. I know this mayoral race has been especially tense. Lord knows I have not pulled any punches when it comes to demanding accountability from this mayor.  I have however refrained from making personal attacks. It just isn't my style.  In political campaigning there are a number of ways that candidates try and gain votes. My campaign has consisted of openly stating exactly what my opponent is doing and why. That includes her activities in the office as well as in her campaign. She and her supporters might have you believe that to be some sort of negative campaign. It isn't. Demanding accountability and demonstrating myself to be the stronger candidate is NOT a negative campaign.  You know what is negative though?  When a candidate and her supporters attempt to rewrite your character. It is even worse when they become obsessed and unhinged with trying to control the narrative. It is a sad and true statement of our political climate that people are so emotionally attached to their party that they will refuse reason and fact to keep pushing their party or candidates narrative. Often times they don't care who they hurt. Both sides have people that engage in this assassination of others. Then when it's all over we have to figure out how to citizens coexisting again. It takes longer and longer to heal from the hate slung in the process. It is a sickness that crosses party lines.  I want to take a minute to address this if you're open to hearing me out.  The 2016 presidential election was a particularly painful one for America. The campaigns of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders were divisive for American citizens. Each campaign tapped into some part of people that resonated at a deep level. So deep in fact that a communication desperately needed amongst citizens is still not rebuilt. It is demonstrated on social media daily. It has become more about winning than about finding the truths and compromises that are best for all of us.  That is what war looks like folks and it's ugly.  Well I'm not interested in a politics war in my backyard. I love this city. I love the people of this city. White black Hispanic gay lesbian straight short tall male and female. It is my goal to represent you all fairly and equally. It is also my goal to represent you responsibly. We have a debt crisis and a housing crisis that won't be solved by finger pointing at people's characters.  In my life I have supported some very far right and some very far left people and ideas politically speaking. Have a look at the RGJ debate if you want to see some examples of what I mean. In the end I am a staunch fiscal conservative and a flexible social moderate. - I believe in the arts and I believe we should have open fire stations first. - I believe in flying the LGBT flag and I believe we should all together honor the nation that gives our diverse citizenry the freedom to be open about who they are first. - I believe in new ideas and I believe before we just try them we should consider the citizens of #RenoFirst.  What am I saying?  * I am saying that I will not be letting up on my campaign to highlight to citizens the irresponsible decisions that our current mayor has made. * I am saying that I will not be letting up on my message that this mayor puts special interest groups and lobbyist friends first. * I am saying that I will not be letting up that we are at a dangerous crossroad for the direction of our city. * I am saying that I will not be letting up on holding the mayor accountable for the fact that there have been more steps backward than forward during her tenure as mayor.  I can say those things without attacking who she is as a human being. Attacking me as a human being is all she and her supporters have. They won't acknowledge that I too am a good human being. Why do these individuals want to control what citizens think so desperately?  In closing I ask citizens regardless of who you support to stop the personal attacks. Especially you rogue trolls. Every unwarranted personal attack is a demonstration of your own ignorance. I don't care which party or candidate you support. A nice man is being accused of being a racist by a rogue troll. Meanwhile his wife is a woman of color. That is ignorant and hurtful. It is the epitome of ignorant and hurtful. (See his message in the comments) Can you imagine being viciously attacked this way just because you support fiscal conservatism? It's ok for people to support responsible spending.  Let's stick to the issues. I ask this of my supporters especially. If we don't engage the personal attacks and stick to the issues instead then we've already won. The truth is out there. The facts are out there. You can see facts and truth in the debate video posted on the Reno Gazette Journal's FB page.  #RenoFirst #EddieLorton #RememberReason #ShareIfYouAgree #HelpSpreadTruth,political,Facebook

"SAVE ""THE MAC""  While it should be shocking a defense of Mac Dale Park is needed in actuality it comes as no surprise. Nothing in our county remains sacrosanct not even an institution such as The Mac. If there could ever be such a categorical designation for a building facility landmark etc. in our county Mac Dale Park should be the title of the category and the question for admittance should be Has such a place reached Mac Dale Park status? For our county Mac Dale Park is the Holy Grail of all things good wholesome and innocent its overall aesthetic appearance certainly a throw-back to a different time (mirroring the general appearance of the county) though unmatched by any facility no matter how great or expensive in charm nostalgia and history. While The Mac doesnt catch the eye its steady and constant presence in the life of our community makes it irreplaceable.  Transcending generational racial and geo-political divides within our county for some fifty years like no other place while The Mac even on its best day certainly does not have the visual appeal or the new-age amenities of larger facilities it makes up for it in its unique character and its ability to arouse an allegiance to a sense of place! It is our Sandlot--the greatest little Sandlot Ive ever known or ever want to know. With a near certainty if one grew up in Lawrence County at any point over the past fifty years regardless of race regardless of what part of the county one may have lived no matter if you were a Golden Bear a Red Devil or a Lion and even if you didnt play baseball but certainly if you did almost invariably you spent quite a bit of time at The Mac learning to become Cougars!  The Mac has played a pivotal role in our liveswhether you were a kid chasing baseball immorality whether you were a parent cheering Johnny on and living vicariously through him or a grandparent doing the same or for so many being able to watch your own child and eventually grandchild play in your footsteps on that hallowed little ground. For many of us Mac Dale played and continues to play an enormous role in our lives and she is doing the same for the current generation as we speak that she did for us all those many years ago. Like the game of baseball itself Mac Dale is far more than baseball fields: it is a Cathedral to the memories of our earliest hopes and dreams our triumphs and heart-break individual accomplishments and collective unity a place where many of us learned early crucial life-lessons that helped shape who we are today and bind us to this place we know as home. The Macs very origins and its history tell an incredible story of selfless-love-of-community by a quintessential Lawrence County family a story that should to be told and retold for generations to come by parents and grandparents while making memories of being at The Mac with their own children/grandchildren a story that is the key to all of the best things in our communityselflessly volunteering.  For those of us who are baseball purists when the old Yankee Stadium was closed in 2008 and soon thereafter torn down and replaced with essentially a replica of the old stadium it was a lot like losing a member of the family. Even as a seventeen-year-old on my visits it was not lost on me where I was; I recall the emotions were somewhat akin to a religious experience. Although quite young at the time I was able to grasp the awesome history of that legendary place. Over its nearly 100-year-history virtually all of the most legendary baseball players in the history of the game played on that field. While the powers-that-be raved how the new multi-billion-dollar Yankee Stadium would have all the flashy-up-to-date amenities and all the other junk that comes along with it what they could not replicate was the ties to history. I can tell my kids all about the old Yankee Stadium I can tell them all about my four-game adventure there in 1998 in which I watched arguably the greatest Yankee team of all time with the likes of Derek Jeter Andy Petite Bernie Williams Paul ONeal David Cone Roger Clemons Mariano Rivera and so many others I can show them documentaries and even take them to Cooperstown but NOTHING will rival watching a game at old Yankee Stadium. America lost a gem that day.  The parallels between old Yankee Stadium and The Mac are striking and serve as a warning to us now: Lawrence County should avoid this same fate! For Lawrence County The Mac is our Yankee Stadium. Depending on your age the names of your Babe Ruths Lou Gehrigs Mickey Mantles Mariano Riveras and Derek Jeters are different. But you likely had someone in an older age group to whom you looked up and tried to emulate. For us former players as adults the pleasure of watching a game at The Mac even if our own kid isnt playing is unmatchedthere is something truly special about watching a little league game at The Mac. I have coached and umpired at fields around the state yet I get the most thrill from doing both at The Mac. While the use of the term legendary is shaded differently when describing The Mac (as opposed to that which is used to describe Yankee Stadium) it is no less legendary. NOTHING organically-Lawrence County rivals watching your son play baseball at The Mac just as you once did; NOTHING rivals watching your own Father watch and/or help coach your own son his grandson on the same field he once coached/ watched youthe same field your own grandfather once watched you! Playing at The Mac is a rite-of-passage a tip-of-the-hat to how weWEhave always done little league baseball in this county. Its understandable if one isnt from here or moved in here to be unable to grasp how truly special The Mac is or the importance of keeping it open. Yet their lack-of-understanding does not make it any less so.  While The Mac has fallen on hard times over the past decade or so due to being afflicted with a virus called being managed by the Town of Monticello as was the case with old Yankee Stadium in the late-70s there is merely a need for new management and resolve to overcome the years of neglect and to once again have her shine (the $15000 annually the current Mayor agreed should be cut from her salary would go a very long way to getting The Mac back into shape. There should be upwards of $30000 unspent due to this salary decrease ready to spend)! While The Mac will never be even on her best day the prettiest or fanciest facility and while she may not be capable of hosting a major tournament thats okay. The Mac is uniquely ours where we are only truly concerned with whether we Lawrence Countians may continue playing there.  Not one pitch of regular-season boys little-league baseball should ever be played in Lawrence County outside the confines of The MacEVER. I implore everyone who has ever had any ties to Lawrence County to melt the phone lines of Monticello City Hall (601-587-0045) making your displeasure known and to vehemently declare shutting down The Mac (other than for practice) is absolutely unacceptable.  With that said I personally stand ready to completely oversee the operations of Mac Dale under terms to be negotiated but that include NO COMPENSATION OF ANY KIND and I will strive to return the fields to the condition historically expected of The Mac by the old guard. Further I will make decisions in a manner that I believe would make that same old guard proud. Im capable of such because I learned directly from multiple members of that old guard as to how to do so. The Macs best days were before the Town of Monticello had anything whatsoever to do with her. In that regard at least as much as legally possible it is time to rewind time (and the Town can donate their store-bought pitchers mounds to the PD for target practice).  Please spread the word and help #SAVETHEMAC!  Remember kid there's heroes and there's legends. Heroes get remembered but legends never die; Follow your heart kid and you'll never go wrong BabeThe Sandlot 1993.  Note: References to the Town's management of The Mac allude ONLY TO the Mayor and Board of Aldermen budget and management decisions since the town took over The Mac. The references DO NOT refer to the current Parks Director (or whatever the title is now) nor the two others before that who can only do so much with what they are given and further constrained by what they are allowed to do. As a former Town employee myself I am hypersensitive to being a scapegoat for management failure.",political,Facebook

"BEN & JERRY'S ULTIMATE LOWLIVES OR MISGUIDED FOOLS  Rabbi Yakov Saacks The Chai Center Dix Hills NY AUTHOR OF KABBALAH OF LIFE   Last week Ben & Jerrys Ice Cream made the following announcement.  We believe it is inconsistent with our values for Ben & Jerrys Ice Cream to be sold in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT). We also hear and recognize the concerns shared with us by our fans and trusted partners.  ANTI-SEMITIC? The question that I have been asked multiple times throughout the week --- is this anti- Semitism? Dont they have a right to free speech? This is an opinion etc. After all they have very strong values and do not like to see injustice. Period.  Mmmmm...  RUSSIA I think we need to clear this one up right away. Ben & Jerrys happily sells their full ice cream products in Russia which the last time I checked (today) Russia continues to illegally occupy Ukraine's Autonomous Republic of Crimea (26 081 km) the city of Sevastopol (864 km) certain areas of Donetsk and Luhansk regions (16799 km)  in total 43744 km or 72% of the territory of Ukraine. I have not heard anything about a boycott -- have you? Not a word of protest. So Ben & Jerrys picks and chooses their battles of injustice. I wonder if this has anything to do with the amount of people buying their product instead of justice.  UNITED ARAB EMIRATES Moving on to United Arab Emirates. Admittedly as far as women are concerned they have come a long way. However when it comes to LGBT causes which are very important to activists like Ben Cohen & Jerry Greenfield they are not allowed. In fact it is illegal in the UAE to be gay. I wonder if their flavor of ice cream called ""Hubby Hubby"" in celebration of the legalization of same-sex marriage in the company's home state of Vermont which features the image of two men in tuxedos getting married beneath a rainbow on the container is being sold there. The bottom line is that you hear crickets from these two Jewish progressives. Nothing!  ISRAEL When it comes to Israel all of a sudden Ben & Jerrys rear their progressive head out of the sandbox and proclaim no more.  This is anti-Semitism at its apex. When you single out one group from many and attempt to denigrate them by a boycott or any other means negatively then this is racist. If the one group happens to be Jews/Israelis then this is anti-Semitism. There is no way around this argument.  My question therefore is; what is it with these Jews from Vermont? Where is their sense of fairness? Why the self-hate?  NOT ALONE Ben & Jerrys is not alone. Air BNB tried this shtick as well only to recant a couple of months later after lawsuits started to come in. There are a handful of other obscure companies that still boycott Israel such as DNB ASA Cactus SA and FreedomCall Ltd. I say they will come around. Even Pepsi which used to boycott Israel ended up purchasing SodaStream a very successful Israeli company much to the chagrin of the BDS movement I might add.  HYPOCRISY I wish to highlight the hypocrisy of not only companies but also of famous individuals who boycott Israel. I once again maintain that although they say it is about justice righteousness and fairness I say nonsense this is about anti-Semitism.  There are so many far-left thinkers who debase Israel time and time again from their comfy armchairs in their ivory towers. Fools such as mathematician David Klein former Green Party Presidential nominee Jill Stein or my favorite Sarah Schulman a novelist and playwright and co-founder of the New York City activist organization called The Lesbian Avengers.  SARAHS COMPLETE SHAM Is Sarah Schulman bothered that homosexuality and any kind of LGBT activity is illegal in Gaza? ""Section 152 of the Penal Code in Gaza criminalizes male consensual same-sex sexual activity and makes it punishable by up to 10 years imprisonment."" (I wonder if there is a penal code for shooting off rockets on innocent civilians.) Then In 2019 the Palestinian Authority (i.e. West Bank) police banned the activities of queer and feminist rights organization Al Qaws and requested that residents report 'suspicious' activities. In addition there is absolutely no law against harassing someone who is gay in these places.  Yet Sarah is silent when it comes to harassment of gays and instead boycotts Israel. Insane immoral and despicable. I bet you Sarah the hypocrite Schulman does not know that gay Palestinians frequently seek refuge in Israel fearing for their lives especially fearing death from members of their own families. According to lawyer Shaul Gannon from the Israeli LGBT organization The Aguda  Israel's LGBT Task Force around 2000 Palestinian homosexuals live in Tel Aviv at any one time.  CONCLUSION People like Ben & Jerry Bernie Sanders and Sarah Schulman are perfidious and disloyal at best and traitors to the Jewish people. They have neither moral code nor a sense of justice. They are simply bad people who cloak themselves in a cause that hurts others on the pretense that they are doing something good.  Lastly in the same infamous and immoral press release issued by Ben & Jerrys they claimed that Although Ben & Jerrys will no longer be sold in the OPT we will stay in Israel through a different arrangement. We will share an update on this as soon as were ready.  I say get out of Israel. There are plenty of great ice cream companies in Israel for the Israelis to buy and sell. We will do fine on our own without your stupid names like Yes Pecan or I Dough I Dough. They say that Ben Cohen has severe anosmia the inability to smell. I think that in addition to this challenge he has the inability to think.  I believe that until the parent company Unilever steps up to the plate I agree with the Town of Hempstead under the initiative of Bruce Blakeman to stop doing business with the entire company until they set this straight. As for me Ben & Jerrys Ice Cream is done forever and ever.  Please feel free to share.",political,Facebook

She is level-headed intelligent thoughtful upright and speaks the truth. -Jane Morlan  I've known Theresa professionally since our law school days 1976-1980. She was a brilliant student and very hard working traveling several hours each evening to attend night school at Lewis & Clark Law School while raising a large family with her husband. We worked together successfully on joint legal projects for many years. I have followed her progress on the Lake Oswego City Counsel and know she will be the type of mayor our city needs to bring housing transportation and services to a broader community of people who may have been under served in the past.

A servant leader is one who whose allegiance is to the People. They are not in it for themselves the power the influence or the prestige. A servant leader is Tenacious. They know that the job will be tough. They know what they were sent to do  and they are fierce in their pursuit of those initiatives which will benefit the people they serve. A servant leader is Honest. They say what they mean and they mean what they say. They have integrity and demonstrate it through their words and deeds. A servant leader is Ethical. Their word is their bond. They seek fairness and equity in all matters. They advocate for Justice  social racial economic and environmental. A servant leader is Resolute. They investigate matters fully drawing on expertise and seeking wide council and then make independent decisions. A servant leader is Experienced. They learn from all their varied life lessons and apply those learnings in novel situations. They use their experience to leverage positive outcomes for those whom they serve  the People. A servant leader is Sincere. They are genuine and speak clearly and plainly to everyone. They dont change their story depending on the audience. They hold true to their values.

I've been watching the comments about Tulsi dropping out but it doesn't change my fundamental message: Our politicians have not served us well and it's time to change that.  Trump was elected because people want a change and the Democratic party offered up Hillary Clinton. I am not critical of Hillary I voted for her and against a mainstream republican candidate I am certain she would have won.  But republican offered up to their base Donald Trump. The ultimate change in politicians.  We are living in a time of great peril and great opportunity. We have serious problems ahead of us and we need serious people in office. People who are not in serious debt to donors and haven't accumulated political baggage. People who care more about their constituents than themselves. People like and .  Even if you disagree with their ideas you have to agree that they are agents of positive change. Sen Sanders has effectively driven the Democratic Platform since he ran for President in 2018. Rep Ocasio-Cortez's influence is astonishing for a first term congressperson and has taken up the message and is running with it.  Hawaii stands at a crossroads - do we want to take a risk and drive what America and the World become next or are we going to elect another self-absorbed politician with a record of not accomplishing anything?

American Politics and Socialism - Charlie's Soapbox Rewind 1/18/19  *NOTE* Charlie will be back with a brand new soapbox on Monday in the meantime here's a timely rewind from 2017. - TeamCDB/BW  One has only to do a little research to see the ravages of socialism. The latest notable example being Venezuela and if youve paid any attention to the news the last couple of years youve watched an oil-rich nation slide into an abyss of deprivation and near starvation.  Socialism is the equivalent of giving away fish instead of fishhooks rewarding ambition and sloth equally taking over every aspect of public life and eventually true socialism morphs into totalitarianism.  It vehemently discourages individuality and assigns where you can live what kind of work you can do and sometimes even the number of children you can have.  One of the most brilliant and innovative optical surgeons on the planet resides in Nashville a man who has invented state of the art equipment and procedures and restoring the eyesight of people who had basically given up hope of ever seeing clearly again came to America many years ago.  His surgery techniques and innovative expertise have set the bar high and will continue to benefit mankind for generations to come.  He was born in China and was on his way to spending his life in an agricultural commune and only a unique set of circumstances - and the hand of God - prevented the world from being denied the healing talents of this brilliant individual.  How many worldclass scientists artists doctors physicists and mathematicians are hoeing beans in some provincial backcountry commune in China and other socialist nations talents the world will never know about the victims of a vindictive political system that fears letting the number of the best and the brightest grow beyond what they can control hand and foot.  The basic philosophy of socialism sounds innocent benevolent and making sure that everybody has the same shot free education government-run universal health care for all guaranteed employment at a good wage with somebody looking over your shoulder to supply every need cradle to grave.  Then the ugly truth begins to surface.  We find out that all this free stuff isnt free at all. It has to be paid for and since socialism encourages more and more entitlements and when people find out they can stay at home in their government subsidized apartment buy their food with government-subsidized food vouchers and make almost as much from their government-subsidized stipend as they could by getting up and going to work every morning why bother.  Which means that the tax base shrinks and shrinks and with the specter of not being re-elected hanging over their heads the pragmatic politicians raise the tax rate on those who are still working for a living and as you might imagine this can only work a few times before even the productive folks say to hell with it and join the masses who stay at home and watch soap operas all day.  Socialism is very much like a snake that begins swallowing its tail and swallows as far as it can and then just lies there and dies.  A microcosm of the results of socialism is taking place even now as working people in high tax states are moving out to low tax states in droves. Tennessee has no state income tax and one hundred people a day are moving into Nashville alone the economy is booming the skies over the city are full of construction cranes and industry continues to relocate in the state.  Its called capitalism the system that still creates great wealth for those with the idea for the better mousetrap encourages individuality rewards personal effort free markets and thrives on innovation and going the extra mile.  I have little doubt that Bernie Sanders or someone else of his political ilk will make a serious run at president in 2020 and as we saw in 2016 there is a younger demographic in this country who thinks that Bernies socialism is the answer.  If he and his element are able to build on that base and a socialist is elected the demise of America will begin in earnest.  Why do I say this?  Because a government-run postal service which once had a monopoly on moving practically all mail has been overtaken by public sector entities with no government assistance at all.  To imagine what government-run health care would be like take a look at the nightmare of the Veterans Administration.  The ultimate goal of socialism is complete control and the restrictions that would be put on manufacturing would drive them off shore further decimating the tax base and necessitating raising taxes time after time and you can imagine where that road leads.  Entitlements would grow exponentially prices would skyrocket the stock market would tank the interest payments alone on the national debt would take 100% of our GDP and Americas credit rating would go through the floor.  A desperate and dovish socialist government would start making serious cuts in the military and I dont even want to go down that road.  Then when dramatic entitlement cuts would - of dire necessity - begin it would take force to control the unrest and the totalitarian phase would begin.  False scenario?  I most sincerely hope so.  What do you think?  Pray for our troops our police and the peace of Jerusalem.  God Bless America  Charlie Daniels,political,Facebook

If you want to vote for Sanders because you think he can beat Trump and you agree with his ideology there is something else you need to consider. What would a Sanders presidency look like? Sanders does not have a whole slate of Socialists running for the Senate and the House. In order to get legislation through Congress you either need bipartisan support or a strong caucus of legislators that agree with your ideology. This means Bernie has zero percent chance of getting his revolutionary ideas through Congress. Most young Bernie supporters do not remember the Carter administration. Despite his party holding both houses President Carter had difficulty getting legislation through. In his case it was more about special interest control and intraparty vendettas rather than ideology but it is an example of what happens to a president who does not have a large group of allies in Congress. A Sanders presidency could very well end up the most ineffective administration in modern history.,political,Facebook

"Bernie let's be clear if Trump gets re-elected all the ""progress"" you say you have made to destroy America will vanish. You are right what was once thought to be very radical is now become more mainstream. But what you think is progress and mainstream is exactly the opposite. It is moving backwards and extreme and denying history and the misery of your socialistic ideas and wishes. Raising taxes stifles the economy and jobs. Taking away incentives of free enterprise and entrepreneurship from doers and creators will slow growth and economic prosperity. People have come here from socialist and communist countries by the millions  not the other way around ! Capitalism has always been a better system than socialism and communism except for power hungry charlatans and demagogues who are fools and want to fool the innocent the unaware and naive and indifferent and the careless. The USSR was a complete failure just like Cuba and North Korea and Venezuela. China only prospered after Mao when they adopted free enterprise and capitalism. They have become a global economic power because of this practice. Bernie you are at least a century out of date.

"This is a long post. Sorry. Even so it only tells a small fraction of the tale of ""What the Democrats stand for"". I had to give it a try.  I hear people complaining about the Democratic Party about how its message has been lost in the resist Trump furor and Americans in the middle - who as always are numerous - hear the loud Nos but dont know as was the case with the Republicans' endless ""No's"" during the Obama administration what alternative the Democrats stand for.  The Democrats have made some mistakes. Theyve played political games and manipulated elections. In the 2016 primary race they got caught doing it to Bernie Sanders in favor of Hillary Clinton. When Wikileaks made that public the Dems lost a whole lot of credibility with those folks in the middle. I admit I was shaken by it myself and Ive been a registered Democrat since I turned 18 a fairly long time ago.  Some in the party point their fingers at the Republicans and the alleged collusion with Russia to get Trump elected. They have every right to do so; from what weve learned it looks like the Wikileaks bombshell may well have been a part of that Russian interference. Still that doesnt excuse the Dems from their own machinations to make the choice for the people. In an election so focused on insiders vs. outsiders Bernie just might have had a better chance to win than Hillary did.  So okay. Political games are played on both sides. At least the Dems games - those that have come to light anyway - have had only American players.  That said theres still the question of What do the Democrats stand for?  Over our countrys history the political message of both parties has changed. After all as the Republicans are so quick to point out (almost as quickly as they invoke the name Reagan) theirs is the party Abraham Lincoln called his own. That seems ironic in light of current Republican policies.  Since the Great Depression however the Democrats have been the champions of the working people of America. Franklin Roosevelts New Deal policies brought our economy out of the worst financial crisis in our history. So far.  Workers unions forced corporate entities to share some of their wealth with the people who created that wealth and in the process created the Middle Class. The Democratic party was there with them supporting the right of every American to a living wage and safe working conditions. The laws creating the 40-hour work week and time-and-a-half for overtime (not to mention countless other advances) came directly from this relationship of government and workers.  The Republican Party uses its powers of persuasion to vilify those unions - using non-union workers jealousy to drive a wedge into the Middle Class and convince people that the unions are the problem rather than the solution - in order to take away the workers power to bargain with their bosses.  Programs that help to care for workers whove reached the end of their careers like Social Security - which Republicans insist on calling entitlements even though every worker pays into the system his or her entire working life - came from the Democratic Party. The program is in trouble only because of decisions made by politicians to use our money elsewhere.  Health care in America is so costly that many Americans die for want of insurance. The Obama administration went further toward helping to fix that problem than any other - passing the Affordable Care Act which allowed millions of people to acquire the means to care for their families illness and injuries. The Republicans rather than find ways to fix its problems so that even more Americans have insurance have relentlessly worked to repeal it or failing that to neglect its support so severely that it dies.  The Republican Party may have been the Party of Lincoln but the Democrats have been and continue to be the party of civil rights. What good is Emancipation without equality? Look around and show me even one Republican-backed program to assure that all American minorities share in the American Dream. If you find one that isnt a sham you have better eyesight than mine.  Education is a necessity in a democracy. People need to understand the challenges we face in order to be responsible citizens who have some chance of voting in their own best interest rather than those of the best liar. Public education is under siege higher education is becoming so expensive that the burden of debt is crushing those who aspire to become the assets America needs in the fast-changing world in which we must live and compete with other nations.  The air we breathe and the water we drink are getting dirtier at a faster pace than in decades thanks to the Republicans repeal of the many protections Democrats fought to make law. Environmental protection has been crippled so that corporations can increase their profits profits that dont trickle down to the average American. Trickle-down economics depends on the benevolence of those at the top. Look at the wealth-share charts from economists if you need more proof of the lack of benevolence at the top.  Democrats need to remember those things today. To speak out about taxing people according to what they take from the system. About the power of collective bargaining for all American workers about Medicaid for all about protecting the rights of the working-people the people of color the people of whatever gender or sexual orientation about helping every American to get a good education so that everyone can participate in the greatest form of government ever to arise on this planet.  Thats a short summary of what the Democrats stand for. Its a message we've been ""gently urging"" lately trying to maintain a polite environment that unfortunately doesn't exist in today's polarized politics. Our reluctance to fight for our morals makes us weak in the face of the onslaught from the Right.  Our message is the American people's message. It needs us to shout it at every newscast microphone on every street corner in every discussion in every home club and gathering. With the repeal of Net Neutrality I predict that grassroots efforts like the one that got Obama elected will be more difficult to pull off. That's another reason we need to take off the kid gloves.  Its the only way to counter the oppositions misinformation campaign. That and pointing out and debunking the lies they tell. So many of us see that sort of thing as taking the low road; but whats so low about fighting for truth justice and the American Way?",political,Facebook
DEMOCRATS ANNIHILATION of the ENGLISH LANGUAGE and STANDARD PROSEas DEMOCRAT Elizabeth Warren ISSUES her 163rd PUBLIC APOLOGY for INDIAN LIES  TODAY: At a Native American Presidential Forum in Iowa:  I know that I have made mistakes.

It is a great honor to partner with Indian Country.  ANALYSIS (for normal English speakers)  mistake [Used incorrectly here. A mistake would be to put a first name on an application where a last name is supposed to go and vice versa. Or to put the state in the blank where the city should go. However writing that you are an Indian when you are not and never have been is not a mistake any more than writing that your age is 37 when you are actually 54. But modern Democrats or Leftistsas Orwell forewarneduse language only as a means of political manipulation.]  sorry for harm I have caused [Yes to my campaign. Otherwise the apology would be direct like the old-fashioned apology: I am sorry for what I did and for the misrepresentations that I made that accrued to my advantage. I was wrong to take those advantagesand steal from those who actually are Indian.]  ...listened and...learned [Throwaway line. Standard political consultant speech-writing boilerplate.]  grateful for the many conversations we have had together... [About as empty and devoid of meaning as can be strung together. Filler. Attempting to imply it has something to do with owning up to wrongdoing but without actually admitting anythingthe conversations could have been about anything.]  partner with Indian Country. [She meant pander instead of partner  meaning Ill say or do anything if you give me a pass for lying about being Cherokee.

Figuratively speaking how can the Republican Party convince people to buy new Republican stock as a great future investment and not as volatile short-term liabilities? By reaching out to the new demographic voting groups today instead of few months before elections.  After Barack Obamas consecutive victories political pundits eagerly pointed out what the Republican Party should do in order to stay politically relevant. Arguably demographics and socio-economic trends werent particularly favorable: Apparently majority of women disliked us immigrants feared us and younger generations saw the GOP as an advocate for greedy business lead by rich old white men.  Although GOP primaries and the election night proved these assumptions inaccurate conservatives shouldnt repeat the mistakes of the Democratic Party who with the help of Hollywood doesnt want to look within the partys (corrupt) ideas. Then again this should not be surprising because according to liberal ideology lifes misfortunes are always someone elses fault. Nevertheless no matter how poor the democratic administrations policies have been our failure to reach out to growing demographic groups wont tip the scale in our favor in the long term.  Whereas younger voters found Obama charismatic because of his well-built brand our brand has become a ball and chain for new candidates even before they start campaigning. That being said can the GOP afford to lose the future Millennial voter base to toxic socialist utopian ideas created by a rich white old socialist Bernie Sanders? Absolutely not. Therefore the new playbook of GOP political strategy must be written with new rules and by authors outside the ivory towers of D.C.  What to do? Populism or not the era of Think Global Act Global is diminishing. New conservatism will emerge from local grass-root levels. People at local communities have been empowered by technological revolution to govern themselves with the freedom of choice in many areas of life. Governance however is still stuck in the era of industrial revolution with limited freedom to choose  la Milton Friedman.  Let us be humble in victory and courageous in new era governance.

Today we are in the throws of yet another election. First we must register to vote or confirm no matter where you live in the US that you are STILL a registered voter.  Next we must learn about the candidates that are running for President. We must be diligent or we will loose yet again. This is NOT the time to be careless or fickle. We MUST GET IT RIGHT!  Here are the five people still in the race - of those only three have a chance to win. So I have decided to focus on those three because WE MUST GET IT RIGHT!  First Senator Bernie Sanders from VT. He is for early childhood education (at no cost) universal single-payer healthcare (everyone should be able to have healthcare as a right not a privilege) and supports green new deal and climate change measures and knows that plenty of jobs for this initiative will be just around the corner. He also supports the unions. Some may not know that he supported SNCC (Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee during the 1960's). The only thing that might be noted as well is that he is against Reparations for our pain and suffering.  Next former Vice President Joe Biden. Although he served this country for almost half a century his record speaks for itself. However here are some low and high-points: A former US Senator '73 until 2009 he oversaw the case of Professor Anita Hill and now Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. He is also known for backing the war in IRAQ after 911 but not backing a surge of troops in 2007 to help end the war. On the other hand he did help pass the Violence Against Women Act. He also led the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act which put more money into prisons instead of into prevention. Something to think about right?:,political,Facebook

Campaign Update:  According to the Gravis poll released a week ago I am at 16% in a head to head to head match with the two major party candidates even though they have outspent us about 400 to 1 and the New Jersey print media have a virtual blackout of our campaign. See https://sabrinforsenate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SabrinPoll.pdf. Democracy in the Garden State apparently means covering only the two major party candidates who in effect get free coverage while our campaign is ignored. So much for keeping the public informed about the U.S. Senate race. In fact my campaign manager did not receive one phone call asking for a comment on the poll. Former congressman and presidential candidate Dr. Ron Paul sent a video message about my candidacy last week . If the hundreds of thousands (maybe millions) of New Jerseyans who want to see real change in DC based on our message of Peace Liberty Prosperity vote for me I will easily win in November. Voters especially like my universal credits for charitable donations. I was interviewed last Monday for Hot in Hunterdon podcast and on Tuesday I was interviewed for a new Internet show. As soon as the interviews are posted I will announce them. Last Wednesday Florence and I drove to DC where I signed the no tax pledge of Americans for Tax Reform. I made a three minute presentation and said at the end wouldn't it be wonderful next year that two New York Jews--Bernie and me--debate Socialism vs. Libertarianism-on the floor of the Senate and take it on the road throughout America. One DC journalist said to me afterwards he would pay to see me debate Bernie. On Thursday I was interviewed by Joe Piscopo on his morning show and offered to discuss the issues with Bob Hugin around the state as to who would be the best replacement for Bob Menendez. I asked Joe if he would arrange it and moderate the sessions with others and he said yes. Let's see what happens. August 24 Florence and I celebrated our 50th anniversary with a dinner at a local restaurant and at 8pm did a Facebook live event. You can see the video on the Murray Sabrin for Senate FB page. We asked all our FB friend to celebrate our amazing life together with a $50 (or more) donation to our campaign . I believe if we can raise $2 million by the middle of October the probability of defeating Bob Menendez is 99.99%. Over the weekend I campaigned at the Hunterdon County Fair where I met hundreds of folks from the county and other parts of the state. Tomorrow I will be a guest on Bill Spadea's 101.5 show at 9:05am. You can listen online at On Tuesday I will be speaking at the Long Hill Township Tea Party to unveil my new tax proposals 6:00 to 8:00 pm at 917 Valley Rd. Gillette NJ 07933. My proposals will generate jobs increase living standards and yes shrink the size of the federal government. Hope you can make it. Wednesday I will be in Trenton to tape a show with Stan Matthews that will air after Labor Day (TBA). I will be a guest on Julie Briggs' radio show this coming Sunday 11am 1250AM and online at Campaign rally on Sept. 15 at Rutgers. Your attendance will kick-off the sprint to November. What is the path to victory despite not having multimillions of dollars in our bank account and the MSM ignoring our campaign? A grassroots effort unlike any other. If 10000-20000 Sabrin supporters can get 50 to 100 voters to the polls on November 6 one million votes will be cast for me more than enough to win in a three way race. That is the basic arithmetic.

Obama knows this their people know it the media knows it the DNC and the democrats know it and so do the rest of the population.He won the primaries by default because the other candidates were totally unqualified and Bernie Sanders was too socialistic and to the left of even the leftist democrats. SoI am pretty sure that Obama and the democrats and company will surprise us all very soon with a "" big surprise"" a well planned thought out "" unexpected solution "" .

"The conventions contrast Last week August 17th. 2020 we had the Democrat national convention or the week of doom and gloom darkness and depression. We were told that everything in America needs to be corrected and that the country is racist and bad. We were told blame America first. Not one word of condemnation of riots and looting and burning and violence. Not one word to unify the country or to inspire the people ! The experts of racial divisive rhetoric and the demagogues were out in the open. The guy who has been in politics for 48 years and 8 years as Vice President and his gang who have failed us for decades were at it again including Barack Obama and Michelle Obama and Bernie and Pelosi and the rest of the mob. They had one message in common America is a bad country and racist and President Trump is even worse and everything is his fault for being in office for about 3 and one half years. A week of darkness ended pessimism ended.Thank God. Hey Joe what do you say ? ""If you vote for Biden ..................it's very plain you ain't sane"" !  Contrast that with the Republican national convention week of August 24th. 2020. America is unique a land of greatness and light and exceptionalism. America first. The police are needed and are there for your safety and protection despite some bad cops. Law and order versus violence and anarchy and destruction. The differences between the candidates and the parties they represent could not be any more obvious.The choice is so easy to make if you want to live in safety and freedom and have equal opportunity and equal justice. One man runs with polls the other with principle and conviction and vision.  A president that wants to keep america great and to keep people with jobs and dignity. A President that will protect the country from enemies and rival countries who want to see America decline like China and Iran. A President that is ending terrible trade deals where the American worker was tossed away like needless dirt. Clean the swamp and end the deep state Mr. President despite the fierce and corrupt opposition and their media allies. Stop the fascist socialist democrats because they are no longer democratic.  What a difference one man can make with another man ! What a difference between optimism and total pessimism.The dark versus light. I hate America versus I love America.  God bless you President Trump America needs you for the next four years.  God bless you and God bless America !",political,Facebook
"If Joe Biden is trying to pick up votes in the Midwest I am not sure why he'd tell anyone about his radical and dangerous environmental plan. At the risk of sounding dramatic--if enacted as drafted the plan would end life as we know it in northeast Indiana.  The plan would:  - Outlaw coal and natural gas - Ban oil and gas production on federal lands and offshore - Mandate zero-emission cars - Apply aggressive new building standards and codes - Create a new Environmental Justice department that would arrest people for polluting - Delete millions of jobs in the energy sector and many more in the industries that depend on it... in the middle of a pandemic  Your car your house even your diswasher won't be up to code in Joe Biden's America.

"[From the Bernie Sanders Campaign last week]  ""Bernie's message tonight will not be complicated:  Donald Trump must be defeated.  We cannot continue having a president who is undermining American democracy who is a pathological liar whose rejection of science in the midst of the horrific pandemic we are experiencing has resulted in the unnecessary loss of tens of thousands of lives and who still does not recognize the existential threat that climate change poses to our planet.  Donald Trump must be defeated.  We cannot continue having a president who is a racist a sexist a xenophobe a homophobe and a religious bigot someone who is intentionally trying to divide our people through fear and hatred.  Donald Trump must be defeated.  We cannot continue having a president who gives massive tax breaks to the richest people in the country and the largest corporations while he tries to throw 32 million people off of the health care that they have and wants to make huge cuts to Medicaid Medicare Social Security education and environmental protection...  In this unprecedented moment in American history we have two major tasks in front of us:  First we must do everything possible to defeat Donald Trump and elect Joe Biden as our next president.  Second the day after Biden is elected we must mobilize grassroots America to make certain that Biden a Democratic House and a Democratic Senate pass the most progressive agenda since FDR and the 1930s. We must create a government that works for all not just the 1% and powerful special interests.""",political,Facebook

Let's assume Biden wins the nomination which is the most likely outcome at this point because the people that brought us Hillary are also producing the Biden Show and so their will must reign but who does he pick as VP in order to actually win? Apart from lots of issues with the Hillary candidature the final nail was choosing Tim Kaine as VP. Who does Biden chose to have a better chance. My two choices are Warren or Castro. Warren for bringing progressives and the young along and Castro for bringing Hispanics who are more in favor of Bernie.,political,Facebook

Now it seems like they might settle for Warren but only if she assures them she'll play the kind of ball they like. If we push harder they threaten us with 4 more years of Trump.

"JUDGES: FERC FAILED ON PIPELINE APPROVAL Article in EnergyWire E&E News reporter Nina H. Farrah  Opponents of the Nexus natural gas pipeline are celebrating a partial win after a federal appeals court decision Friday that could have ripple effects for U.S. energy exports.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit is requiring the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to take another look at its rationale for justifying the approval of the pipeline which runs through Ohio and Michigan.  The natural gas pipeline had proved contentious for its use of eminent domain to facilitate its construction and raised broader questions about what counts as public use for justifying pipeline development.  ""It would have been nice for the court to make the decision to say it violates the statute and Constitution but we didn't think it would happen. From our perspective it's a great decision"" said Carolyn Elefant an attorney representing the city of Oberlin Ohio which was in the path of the pipeline.  The petitioners took issue with FERC's approval of the use of eminent domain to build a pipeline that was carrying a significant portion of gas for export to Canada.  They point out that while the Natural Gas Act allows the use of eminent domain for pipeline projects it does so for interstate projects not international pipelines. In this instance they argued the project which was certified as an interstate pipeline was justified in part on commitments from Canadian shippers.  The petitioners also argued the pipeline approval is a violation of the ""takings clause"" a provision of the Fifth Amendment that prevents taking private property for public use without ""just compensation.""  The arguments gained traction with the judges hearing the case.  ""[T]he Commission failed to adequately justify its determination that it is lawful to credit Nexus's contracts with foreign shippers serving foreign customers as evidence of market demand for the interstate pipeline"" wrote Judge Robert Wilkins an Obama appointee in the opinion.  The panel rejected a second line of argument against the pipeline in which petitioners maintained the pipeline was subscribed by shippers at only a 59% capacity.  James Coleman an associate professor of law at Southern Methodist University called Friday's opinion a ""huge decision.""  ""It's a big issue that is becoming bigger around the country. You can take land when you have public use but which public are you referring to? Does it refer to the domestic public or the broader public?"" he said.  Last week's decision doesn't answer that question but instructs FERC to reconsider its rationale for approving the Nexus pipeline.  ""It looks like the courts are saying there may be some roadblocks; is it appropriate to use eminent domain to support exports to Canada?"" he said.  Coleman noted that in the U.S.-Canada energy trade Canada had used its equivalent of eminent domain to send energy to the United States. Now with a natural gas boom in this country the United States is determining whether a similar approach is appropriate here.  The case also comes amid growing state opposition to the use of eminent domain as well as calls from presidential candidates like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) to halt energy exports he said.  This isn't just an issue for natural gas. The ruling could also have significant implications for how FERC goes forward with pipeline development to feed into U.S. LNG projects for export. Those projects have also used eminent domain to construct pipelines to feed to LNG facilities said Elefant.  She also said the judges' reference to the takings clause in the opinion was significant.  ""FERC receives a lot less deference if it has to explain findings under the Constitution"" Elefant said.  She expected that FERC could take anywhere from six to eight months to review the decision.  A spokesperson for Nexus Gas Transmission LLC an intervenor in the case said the company is reviewing the D.C. Circuit's decisions and determining next steps.  ""Nexus underwent more than three years of rigorous public and regulatory review and obtained all necessary authorizations and permits to construct and operate the pipeline and related facilities"" Adam Parker said in an email.  He noted that Friday's decision does not affect the operation of the pipeline.  Twitter: @niina_h_farah Email: nfarah@eenews.net",political,Facebook

So What Happens When All Jobs are done by Robots  Go to some McDonalds and you order from a kiosk not a person. This has been a misunderstood continuing process. This is not about lower paid immigrants or really off shoring as it originally was. It is about one sector of the nation imposing its will on the others. The constant drive for lower labor costs has left us on the doorstep of either complete societal change or vast swaths of the nation becoming destitute. It is the invasion of the job killing robots that we are now having to come to grips with. I believe that Andrew Yang is the first of the truly modern candidates. I am still for Progressives because they as in Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are better equipped to defeat the monster we face. But Andrew Yang is the first credible candidate to start yelling the warning The Robots are coming the Robots are coming! And they are coming for anyone that is of working age. This is not something that is a future event its here and has been here for a while. In Iowa alone 40000 jobs for human workers were replaced by robots from 2010-2018. And much the same nationwide. Only 1/3rd of our graduates finish college so as Yang says it we are a high school educated nation. And all of those jobs that are supposed to be there are not pounding something into something but using highly advanced technical equipment.  The trucking industry is spending billions to get rid of truck drivers. Self-driving trucks are right around the corner. Humans can be unpredictable and unreliable but they can also be creative and ingenious in solving problems. What we are now seeing is a total reorganization of society. Fewer and fewer jobs will be available. What the Cons and Supremacists are doing is using the situation to their advantage. To discount the value of humans into purely economic value. And then as a rationale to get rid of us. You can see it in so many things right now. They want to keep all of the resources make us cheap and easy to get rid of and of little to no value.  There is a restructuring of society coming. It cannot be stopped. But we can chose which way we go. The SocioCons and Supremacists want an authoritarian clamp down of society. That they are the only chance to survive. That their racism and greed are the only way for some to survive them. Foundationism is designed to keep democracy to keep humanity and to spread the ownership of society into the majority. That skin color and religion are not relevant in who does what or who gets what. That we are owners in our world our society with a balance of rights and responsibilities. What all of this mess we are going through now is about is who controls the restructuring and how it is shaped. This is the time to stand up for our humanity and our value. Or we will be silenced and those with money idiots like Donald Trump will make the rules period. RC Romine,political,Facebook

"Kamala Harris gave up. Why? She will survive to run another Presidential race  Persecuted by so-called Realists [often the bane of principled thought] that are only partially informed only focused on the present and the past with little to no analysis of moving into the future. They tend to be Black in the case of Kamala Harris and Jesse Jackson but now we have proof of right wing propaganda using social media to discourage support for Harris. We will come back to this social economic trait but I focus on the question How did we elect a person of color to the POTUS and how do we do it again?  Reparations criminal justice immigration and climate change were the issues of many Black voters not necessarily in that order. Faux Black organizations e.g. ADOS (American Descendants of Slaves) Blexit (black exit [from politics]) #FBA (Foundational Black Americans) Black voices for Trump and Walk away just to name a few false flag operations. How do you recognize these faux organizations? The poor attempts at using Black vernacular. Recently organizedleadership without previous civil rights or black issues advocacy experience. Some are outright fraudsothers are Blacks receiving monies from Trumpets and foreign donations through the NRA (caught receiving Russian money) that makes donations to many Republican and Democratic candidates. What? Did you think Blacks politicians and politics are impervious to greed? Sadly untrue and sadly mostly male.  If a Black person cannot be elected again in the next 15 years [2035 my date of a Color majority; official date 2045] with a white majority as the realist proposed do we wait another 15-25 years to try? A study of Kamala Harris run that started out as a top tier Presidential candidate with the best mix of governing and intellect on the stage but ended in a dried-up monetary base. Complaints: 1. A woman 2. A Black woman 3. A black candidate for POTUS (never again?) 4. A prosecutor Attorney General of California District Attorney  # 1 compliant she is a womana Black woman. The statement itself is misogynistic and considering the 2008-2016 administration an illogical assumption but very often in politics logic has nothing to do with choices. The greatest adversary of Hilary was the conservative to middle ground politics of the white womens vote. I say the greatest because they wanted equal access to the reins of power but would not put aside their differences to vote for a representative of women and she is not Black. So why would they vote for a Black Woman? They held on to their dislike of Hillarys demeanor particularly Hillarys Stand by my man attitude that distressed white and Black women across the nation. They wanted her to strike back possibly divorce or at least separate from POTUS Clinton. So as illogical as asinine as voting against Hillary. She was for the womens movement their hate of Hillary was stronger. A person of reasonable bearing and like experiences in their love life would not say in mixed company that Hillary lost white women and lost the election. Hillary lost to Trump by only 70k votes but 52% of white women voted against Hillary with a large portion of people not voting at all or voting for another Russian influenced candidate Jill Stein (The first 3rd party candidate to receive over 1 million votes since 1948). Is that likely to occur again? The odds are very low but not impossible. There is a visible attempt to break off a portion of the Dem party by another minority woman Tulsi Gabbard congressperson from Hawaii. She has attempted to run against the Dem party to form a center-right (Dem) party more anti-globalist pro-nationalist right than socially liberal. Gabbard is a person of color that has not suffered the same ridicule as Harris by the realist party (SIC). At the same time the Republican party is already split into the Good old Party versus the Neo-Neo-cons Trumpist party and the Good Ole Party is leaving the governing Trumpist party in spades. They want nothing to do with the approaching reckoning. The up and down of the tea party and the same will be the destiny of the Trumpistif not there will be violence. That is the nature of failing democraciesdemocracy to tyranny to dictatorship to reconstruction and/or revolution with new masters and old subjects.  A Black candidate cannot win since the Obama administrations white backlash.  Im voting for him. Hes Black... was said about Obama by Blacks. Encouraged after the Iowa performance more chimed in although a large Black consensus was not in place. There was more support from liberal whites than Blacks after Iowa. Black voters knew as much about Obama as they knew about Kamala Harris at this point. But no one said voting for Obama is a wasted vote as the misguided Black realists has suggested. They [white folks] will not vote for him. He was not considered a threat in Iowa. He started earlier than the other candidates and positioned himself as a candidate for all Americans which was appealing to midwestern predominantly white areas coming from a Black candidate with a broadly white family influence. Obama backed it up with a blistering ground tour of Iowa in an old style everyone problems matters theme. He won Iowa and people of color including Blacks took notice. Whites voted for him. They liked him. He has a chance! This is the socio-economic behavior that controls our moral temper when selecting our representative. We trust a Black candidate when hes chosen by the white media as electable as smart as clean as acceptable to the average middle-class American voter. Unfortunately thats not me and news flash its not you either. Its the middle-American voter. Middle Americans are not an active minority socially just politically. Iowa has no political value except that its over 90% white but considered a bellwether of early political trends. Why? The minority population in Iowa is less than 5% while minorities constitute 40+% of the American population. Iowa is the white privileged choice for President and the media hangs on its choice tracks the history of the Iowa choice in past elections as if in a time warp where nothing changes. Candidates change population demographics change so why Iowa? Consciously or subconsciously Iowa represents white wisdom and logic--that still rules no matter how baseless in demographic logic. With 60 plus days to go before Iowas caucus Kamala claimed defeat by money or lack of it. It was an underwhelming performance for Kamala Harris. Arguably the most brilliant candidate in the early Dem primary if not the most qualified. She was the Prime Minister (SIC) of the 5th largest economy in the world25-30 thousand people came out to her first campaign event. She thrashed Joe Biden in the first debate and was by far the most recognized in the debate at Tyler Perrys studio in Georgia. She has a personable presentation a quick mind and a calm demeanor under pressure. Everything a white candidate or Obama would need to be a winner in Iowa. She was an authority on Black criminal justice issues and one of three candidates [including Booker and Castro] that seemed interested enough in those issues to keep them out front. So why did she quit the race? She made mistakesshe did not own her actions as AG of California she tried to downplay them. She did not spend enough time on the Iowa small town circuit which would garner more media coverage. She did not command enough media coverage on cable channels when she was a top candidate. She changed positions to accommodate the atmosphere e.g. allowing people to keep their insurance when espousing Medicare for all. Most of all assuming people she trusted at the state level was adequate at the national level was a major mistake. All that west coast financial expertise did not translate to national fundraising ability and help came too late. Black people were never behind her preferring to throw their weight behind the least of two evils in the Dem primary after the lessons in 2016 that proved without Russia 77000 votes for Trump(70000 Blacks in Milwaukee Wisconsin alone did not vote) Losing Wi Mi and Pa elected Trump. If Blacks in Mi. and Wi et al had voted Trump would not be POTUS. It was that closenot the thrashing claimed by the dont believe what your lying eyes and ears are seeing and hearing POTUS Trump.  Attorney General of California District Attorney A prosecutor  Did Kamala Harris prosecute Blacks as a prosecuting attorney in Ca.; as a DA as a State Attorney General in the largest state and economy in America besides America itself? Yes. The 5th largest economy in the world is California with a $2.87 trillion economy. California loses money paying taxes to the United States treasury to the tune of $.19 per dollar receiving $.81 in returned monies for every dollar paid and that includes the cost of fighting fires. Trump has threatened funds for fighting fires and for improving insufficient water distribution to parts of a state with enough water to help Nevada. Reparations criminal justice immigration and climate change were the issues of many Black voters not necessarily in that order. Faux Black organizations e.g. ADOS (American Descendants of Slaves) Blexit (black exit [from politics]) #FBA (Foundational Black Americans) Black voices for Trump and Walk away just to name a few *false flag operations*. How do you recognize these faux organizations? The clumsy attempts at using Black vernacularrecently organizedleadership without previous civil rights or black issues advocacy experience. Some are outright fraudsothers are Blacks receiving monies from Trumpets and foreign donations through the NRA (caught receiving Russian money) that makes donations to many Republican and Democratic candidates. False flag operations tend to pose as black women. Black men are not seen as a large threat (sad). Black misogyny is very real among a large portion of Black males 50 yrs. of age and above Why support her if she only supports only black women? What? Did you think Blacks politicians and politics are impervious to misogyny and greed? Sadly untrue and sadly mostly Black male.  California s economy is larger than Russias. GDP: $2.998 trillion (2018) GDP growth: 4.3% (2018). The USAs growth is 2+%. The California economy at $2.87 trillion  bigger than most nations. The total GDP of the United States China Japan and Germany now only surpass Californias economic output. The ranking puts California at fifth in the world just ahead of the United Kingdom which is only $2.625 trillion. A person that manages and is accountable for the execution of Californias legal system is no light weight. Did she prosecute Black men and women? Yes that was her job and if found guilty she jailed them. But I hear no complaints about Amy Jean Klobuchar a very good prosecutor. In *privileged* language that means she had a high conviction rate. I have never heard a question on her actions as a prosecutor on the debate stage or the news media.  Hey Joe where you going with that gun in your hand? Im going out to shoot my Black supporters cause I caught them supporting liberal plans so I took my gun and shot em!  Jimi Hendrix 101st Airborne 1962  Joe Bidens authoring of a crime bill that required sentencing people to mandatory lengths of time imprisoned millions of Black and Latinx people. Biden proposed a bill and a constitutional amendment to make busing unconstitutional. Joe Biden that said I oppose busing. Its an *asinine* concept the utility of which has never been proven to me. Biden said Ive gotten to the point where I think our only recourse to eliminate busing may be a constitutional amendment. The new integration plans being offered are really just *quota systems* to assure a certain number of blacks Chicanos or *whatever* in each school. That to me is the most racist concept you can come up with Biden said. What it says is In order for *your child* with curly black hair brown eyes and dark skin to be able to learn anything he needs to sit next to *my* blond-haired blue-eyed son. Thats racist! Who the hell do we [they] think we are that the only way a black man or woman can learn is if they rub shoulders with my white child? This is the candidate for President of the USA. Biden never talked about separate but equal that often supplied Black children with books 5 years older than the latest texts publication. Schools without heat decent desks and lunchrooms. Underpaid but talented teachers that taught us well despite the system not because of the system. The initial uniforms that Cobb High had were old uniforms from Anniston High. They were thrilled. When it came to reparations for slavery Biden said I dont feel responsible for the sins of my father and grandfather he continued And Ill be damned if I feel responsible to pay for what happened 300 years ago. As if 300 years is that long a time period. Its approximately 5-6 generations only a long time if you were enslaved. In order to even the score we must now give the black man a head start or even hold the white man back to even the race. I dont buy that [affirmative action]. Biden said. His people were the enslavers and he does not care what atrocities they committed to allow him to be where he is today. Thats an acceptance of white privilege and its illegitimate place in America. This does not mean the *realist* has accepted white privilege thats not bad if one confronts that privilege at every turn. Most realist just has not read enough to reject its practitioners. They are the un-woke modern day slavers. Yes slavers because they bring others on board by the passion and zeal of their positions formed by media church and friends. This is enough to categorize Biden as a needs watching. I offer you my reasons above to argue He is the best of two evils. I will not vote for Biden in the primary. He is too dim witted and slow period. He is also a closet neo-con as demonstrated by his former actions for which no one has held him accountable. I will vote for him if he is the Democratic candidate for President of the United States or any winner of the Democratic primary.  Their rhetorical question would be Why did Obama select Joe Biden as his VP? Obama used Biden to win the middle white vote primarily the white womens vote and the suburbs that felt they had nothing to fear from this* articulate* *clean* *moderate* Black man raised by white people. They were correct. The Obama decision was brilliant. They could elect a Black manblacks have moved the nation towards a moralistic and judicial center from the tyrannical right which is the prevailing underlying status in American politics. They would have no fear of what the senator from Mississippi Trent Lott said on the night of Obamas win and there will be no reparations here. He assumed reparations would be a natural request from a Black President since white privilege has been a goal of every white lawmaker from the city mayor to the President of the United States. White privilege molded the present including the present civil rights law that was so easily deteriorated by the Roberts court. Remember the quote by the Supreme court The Black man has no rights that a white man has to respect. Dred Scott  Go get em Bernie!! Bernie Sanders would not vote for the civil rights bill saying I think the greater need is the vote for womens equality. The civil rights bill applies to everyone. Bernie needed an excuse not to vote for a potentially unpopular bill. He did not vote for a civil rights bill instead he voted for a bill that improved the status of many women in the USAmostly white women. White women increased their income and status in the business world. Black women not so much. Black women earn less than white women white women advanced to executive positions at a rate double that of Black women. Thanks B. Sanders. I have a wife that could have occupied a much higher position in Human Resources with more zeal for Civil rights than womens rights that proved to be another method of incrementalism rather than a genuine vehicle to equality for Black women. Thank you Bernie may I have another? Sure Im not in favor of reparations. But you are a Jew. Your people have been allowed more reparations than any other groupalive or not. Your people were the primary supporters of reparations for the Japanese interned during WWII. The Jews may have realized that this would be an issue in their future and its an issue in the future of my people. This country cannot say they are or were a civilized people if they do not want to pay for the abuse terrorism and free labor that provided this country with wealth that supported a powerful military that fostered a powerful political base worldwide and positioned this country as a world leader. We did that. But there was a cankerous sore in this country [covetous and avarice]. It remains festering and dividing and blaming others for its own faults. As philosophers pull and push seemly without purpose other than to be recognized as a philosopher (philosophers to become Kings or Kings to become philosophers. Plato)  To much democracy is not good for democracy. Was the essence of the founders that never wanted a democracy.  Democracy does not appear in the constitution or the Bill of Rights as a result. That was said by one of the founders. They never accepted that the people were smart enough to govern. George Washington said as much The Senate would comprise natural aristocrats chosen by state legislators rather than elected by the people. [now elected by the people]. And rather than directly electing the chief executive the people would vote for wise electorsthat is propertied *white men*who would ultimately choose a president of the highest character and most discerning judgment. The *electoral college* has failed the last 2 of 3 presidents. So how does it really work George? ""But when a new generation arises and the democracy falls into the hands of the grandchildren of its founders they have become so accustomed to freedom and equality that they no longer value them and begin to aim at pre-eminence (superiority); and it is chiefly those of ample fortune who fall into this error. As soon as they find a leader who is enterprising but is excluded from the houses of office by his penury [they will] institute the rule of violence; and now uniting their forces massacre banish and plunder until they degenerate again into perfect savages [they are at heart] and find once more another master and monarch."" Polybius; The Histories Of the Roman Republic 220-146 BC  The disorders and miseries which result gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the absolute power of an individual; and sooner or later the chief of some prevailing faction more able or *more fortunate* than his competitors turns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation on the ruins of public liberty. George Washington  This Washington quote concerning too much money versus the political process. The more fortunate in times of uncertainty are a dangerous catalyst that speeds up political unrest and soften the desire for a king a usurper that replaces individual liberties protected by the government with absolute tyranny. All governments that has followed this path has failed. Roman Greek and lately French all failed by a sole bearer of the cloak of power. It is the curse of absolute powerit corrupts absolutely. Ex-POTUS George Washington that resigned the Presidency saying that it was too powerful. He served 8 years. Washington also disliked Parties. He was an independent. the only independent POTUS in the countrys history.  The Senate would comprise natural aristocrats chosen by state legislators rather than elected by the people. [now elected by the people]. And rather than directly electing the chief executive the people would vote for wise electorsthat is propertied *white men*who would ultimately choose a president of the highest character and most discerning judgment.

June 25 2017  Donald Trump tweeted Hillary Clinton colluded with the Democratic Party in order to beat Crazy Bernie Sanders. Is she allowed to so collude? Unfair to Bernie!

Time magazine has confirmed the cover is fake.  266.  June 29 2017  Donald Trump attacked TV news host Mika Brzezinski on Twitter saying he had once seen her when she was badly bleeding from a face-lift.  267.  June 30 2017  MSNBC news anchors Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski alleged the White House tried to blackmail them with an article about their relationship in the National Enquirer. The newly engaged co-anchors claimed they had texts and phone records from Trump advisers threatening to publish the Enquirer article if the pair did not contact Trump directly. The president apparently sought an apology for the couples unfavorable news coverage. Trump is a long-time friend and ally of David Pecker the publisher of the National Enquirer and had leveraged the relationship before. The Enquirer then published a hit piece on Scarborough and Brzezinskis relationship.  268.  June 30 2017  For the position of senior adviser in the Office of Gender Equality and Womens Empowerment Donald Trump appointed an activist who led a campaign to restrict transgender access to bathrooms. Under the Obama Administration the Office of Gender Equality supported LGBT empowerment both domestically and abroad. Bethany Kozma the activist and new senior adviser has said in the past With Trump we now have a president who is focused on remedying the lawlessness of the previous administration.  269.  June 30 2017  Referring to the Houses passage of a second repeal-and-replace bill Donald Trump tweeted If Republican Senators are unable to pass what they are working on now they should immediately REPEAL and then REPLACE at a later date!

June 2017  Two anonymous White House officials told the New York Times that Donald Trump said Haitians all have AIDS and Nigerian immigrants wouldnt ever go back to their huts. Newly released immigration statistics which reported 15000 Haitian immigrants had entered the U.S. since he took office reportedly ignited President Trumps tirade. While the White House subsequently denied Trump had used the words AIDS and huts it did not deny the overall description of the meeting.  271.  June 2017  The Trump International Hotel in Washington D.C. received $270000 in payments from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for rooms catering and parking as part of a lobbying effort. This violates the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution which forbids government officials from accepting any present Emolument Office or Title of any kind whatever from any King Prince or foreign State. Donald Trump has retained an ownership interest in his businesses and thus could receive payments from foreign states. 239.

What I'm Looking For in a Democratic Nominee  Yesterday I discussed how I don't care (much) about electability when choosing my preferred Democratic candidate. So surely I care about their policy positions. After all I am a public policy professor.  Well a little bit. I suspect that the actual domestic policy outcomes range very little across the different candidates if they are elected. None of them will produce Medicare for All. All of them will expand health insurance coverage under the right conditions. All of them will opt back into the Paris accords. It will be similar across many areas. Foreign policy will vary more but not as much as people might think. All of them will help restore US reputation but it will take more than 4 years to do so for all of them. So while I like ones closer to my positions it's not a deal breaker if they vary from me a bit.  So what I care about is who would be an effective president. Here are my criteria.  Experience in government (so I'm not excited about Buttigieg Beto Yang or the inexperienced House candidates).  Someone who isn't so old that they are unlikely to be healthy for a second term (so I'm not excited about Bernie and Biden).  Preferably a woman (you can figure this one out).  Someone who seems very different than Trump (ok this is all of them).  Someone who has come out in favor of impeachment (so far just Warren and Harris)  Someone who clearly recognizes the existential (NOT NORMAL) nature of the threat of Trump and is ready to make it a centerpiece of the campaign (Biden had a great rollout on this Warren and Booker are also good here).  Then it gets to who seems savvy about policy and seems to care about both realistic possibilities and solving our big problems (inequality and climate change) while keeping what is special about this country (Warren and Inslee get points here).  Things I don't care about. 1. How they behaved 20 years ago. 2. Where they are raising their money.  Let's be clear I will vote for whomever gets the nomination and from July-November 2020 will probably write many many positive words about that person. I also don't vote until late in the primary season so when I do vote there will probably only be two or three people left rendering my preferences rather meaningless at the voting booth. But for now this is how I am looking at the 20 or so candidates.,political,Facebook
Businesses and the Bernie Sanders campaign do not exist for the benefit of employees  I put this post up almost three years ago without the Bernie Sanders reference but thought it a good time to show how human behavior even affects socialists such as Sanders who said that some campaign jobs just aren't worth $15 per hour.  Yeah thats right. Businesses do not exist for the benefit of the employees..they exist for the benefit of the owner. Businesses are not contemplated with the idea of seeing how many employees can be hired. Businesses are contemplated for the purpose of providing an income to the owner. Employees are an expense just like fuel utilities insurance equipment etc etc and nobody goes into business to see how much can be wasted on unneeded expenses.  Businesses are the personal property of the owner..not the government not the employees or omnipotent moral busy bodies. Also businesses have no legal moral ethical or compassionate obligation to pay a living wage whatever that means. Lastly and most important nobody no level of government no court of law can force someone to open or keep open a business. Treating businesses as the enemy while claiming to be a friend of the employee is an irreconcilable contradiction and this is the dilemma faced by those who want to use businesses as their benefactors by proxy.  Economics is very easy to understand because all you need to understand is human behavior. The more difficult something is made to do the less you will get of it. The more costly something is made to do the less you will get of it. It is illegal to fire an employee in France so what do you think the direct result of that has been? If employers are forced to provide innumerable benefits to full-time employees how long do you think they will remain full-time?  Operating a business requires a lot of time energy resources uncertainty and risk and believe it or not there does come a time when it just isnt worth it. Those who advocate for lavish employee benefits seem to think that the customers will just keep coming. Businesses not only compete against each other but must also compete against the customer desires to spend as little as possible which means keeping prices low. Businesses can't force customers to purchase their products. Customers can choose a different supplier or they can simply eliminate the product or service from the their budget. Economics like the United States Constitution is not as difficult a thing to understand as the eggheads want you to believe.,political,Facebook
Just earlier this year do you remember when the crisis at the border was not a crisis?  Julian Castro called the border crisis BS.  Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer accused President Trump of manufacturing a crisis.  Kamala Harris said it was a distraction from the real issues.  Bernie Sanders said Theres no crisis at the border.  Elizabeth Warren called the security issue and emergency at the border fake.  CNNs Jim Acosta tweeted I dont see anything resembling a national emergency situation.  The Washington Post called the crisis untethered from truth and reality.  And today they are saying:  CNN blares: A shocking image of a drowned man and his daughter underscores the crisis at the US-Mexico border.  Pelosi now calls the border situation child abuse and called it a crisis.  Warren says it is humanitarian crisis but it is still too much for her to show up and actually vote on emergency border funding.  Bernie now says the crisis on the southern border is serious.  The main stream media and Democrats are scrambling to rewrite their denials about the border crisis. Now they are using it against Republicans. But it is the Democrats who refuse to address the immigration problem - or what they will now admit is actually a problem.,political,Facebook
Michelle Obama today I skipped lunch and dinner because I knew you were going to deliver a taped message. I skipped eating because I knew I would throw up because of the phony false message I would hear from you. You are so full of it and there is so much of you ! Juan Williams thought you were his mother and The weasel of Fox Chris Wallace thought you were amazing and that you shred and cut President Trump to pieces. Personally it was obvious that you repeated the same divisive racial hatred you husband is an expert of. You make a great couple Your whole party is a party of hate and smears all in the name of love and equality.It was not praising America but more like demonizing the country and those who disagree with the party you represent. You were First Lady for eight years why is the country in such a bad state then ? Why is the country so rotten ? Could it be that rotten socialists and fascists running in the name of democrats have been in charge ? Your indictment of America was not surprising coming from you. You had 8 years of professional experience with dear Barack your husband and our ex President. Your cynicism and your skepticism were classic Obama talk ! Michelle when they go low we encourage burning and looting and rioting and destruction. When they go low we lie and cheat and plot and spread misinformation and propaganda. I was just waiting for your message to erase any doubts about Joe Biden having Alzheimers and dementia.I think you convinced the American people that it is them that have lost their cognitive abilities and not Joe Biden ! Michelle You and Cuomo and Bernie should form a new outdoor circus with John Kasich and the other participants to cheer up the population in these hard times of pandemic and shutdown. lighten up the Covid-19 air around us. Oh don't forget Kamala She will make a good laughing clown too ! Remember when democrats gather together Covid knows and does not spread so you don't need social distancing either. You need social distancing only when you need to go to vote. That is why you need vote by mail to save lives and be safe for the love you have for the people and your concern for their health !,political,Facebook
"Buttigieg: ""We could wake up two weeks from today the day after Super Tuesday and the only candidates left standing will be Bernie Sanders and Mike Bloomberg the two most polarizing figures on this stage.""

"In the 20th Century of American Politics people were fairly consistent in their stances. They either chose to vote for a Democrat or a Republican.  American Politics in the 21st Century however does not seem to be in line with all that. Within the very first two-decades we have begun to see some startling and exciting changes!!!  During the 2016 Presidential Races things began to look quite wonky. We had a lot of characters...  let's just say. And two of those people were Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump.  Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders seemed to accumulate a mass cult following. They picked the Democratic and Republican party voters up in droves. And these voters demonstrated fervor.  These were people with feeling and dedicated passion to say the least. Donald Trumps campaign rallies looked more like rock concerts and Bernie Sanders people chose to take up the slogan ""vote with your heart"" which meant although they knew that they would lose for their side they encouraged others to embrace the truth instead.  There was excitement fever and fury all mixed up in our elections over the people who had chosen to run. For the first time in a LONG time American's were seeing a different way and they were embracing it both from the left and from the right.  Although Trump and Sanders both sought the backing of the Democratic and Republican parties neither seemed to really embrace what they traditionally stood for. Bernie was talking more like a socialist than a true democrat and Trump chose the hit slogan of ""drain the swamp"" while acting pretty much unlike an actual presidential candidate. Or at least what we'd thought that term meant prior to the close of the 2016 races when he was actually elected.  ==> What? We all know it's true... you know that he actually IS ""Our President"" and that he _did_ get elected and that he's not exactly normal. all true. <==   Two years later as we move into the midterms after over a year of marches and protests of all sorts and from all sides over just about every _thing_; we are seeing an enormous amount of change in the way our political elections look. There are candidates showing up in unprecedented numbers in every race from all types if backgrounds and with many different endorsements from many different organizations. There are The Berniecrats The Green Party The Libretarian Party's Constitutionalist Candidates and so many more that even the chair of one of the larger progressive movements in Washington State laughs about the difficulty in keeping up!!!  I get it and I agree.  One thing is for sure though. Regardless of which way one leans either from the left or from the right they're all leaning towards the same thing.  Change.  Change from the traditional two party system. Change toward a more ""people's"" run government. Change toward a better more aligned future with what they want and regardless of what _that_ actually is they want it now and they want it without the previous more traditionally held government of the dynasty and/or big monied interests being involved.  From where I'm sitting I see that everyone is trying but what I don't see is any media speaking about ""a new political party"". They're still talking exclusively about the duopoly. And the problem isn't so much that as I think and I feel that they're right. There is no one standing out from the crowd. There is no winning third party. At least not yet. There will be I hope but there's no traction to make a prediction as to when.  I need to think about this but I think we all need to unite.  I think that my platform can do it. I think that if I reach out to the party leaders and got them to agree we could have them all in one spot. One place that would be organized. Which would be very helpful because __nothing__ is organized right now and we need it to be if we hope to ever beat out the RNC and DNC.  I am going to reach out to a few people tomorrow that I already know but if you can would you please tell me of any parties that you know of?  That would be helpful.  Thank you and  Your Founder Teresa Darden-Behr",political,Facebook

"""Gallows Humor: The Coronavirus Joke Collection""  How do you identify a person with the Coronavirus? Take off his mask.  In baseball the Houston Astros are actually pushing for crowd bans--so that they don't get jeered for their cheating.  On St. Patrick's Day the Irish are now encouraged to only fist bump not kiss the Blarney Stone.  What do you call the Coronavirus if it turns deadly?...The Coroner-virus.  An unexpected effect of the panic sadly has been deforestation. Millions of trees have been stripped of their leaves. Not from the virus--but by shoppers desperate to find an alternative to toilet paper....;)  Drive-through testing is expanding...Along with results you'll get a choice of Chicken McNuggets or a McFlurry.  The federal government is urging elderly employees who have higher rates of risk from the virus to telecommuteThats a nice way of telling Bernie Trump Biden Pelosi McConnell & Schumer to self-quarantine!  After objections from Beijung the Wuhan virus has been renamed to: The Kung Flu.  The panic over infection is so widespread that Harvey Weinstein instead of requesting a reduced sentence is now demanding life without parole in solitary confinement.  Instead of buying masks traders on Wall Street are buying parachutes. ;)  Stone Masons confined to work due to the virus face a Quarrytine.  Just to be safe about the virus I walked into my crowded bank today wearing a mask--and was arrested for robbery.  Arrested for DWI radio talker Alex Jones sees both the Coronavirus and Corona beer as part of the same conspiracy theory.  Due to the virus all presidential debates will not have a live audience but a laugh track.  If due to the virus a Red Light district like Amsterdam's shuts down do they change the red lights to green? And does that send the wrong message?...  At his press conference declaring a national emergency President Trump was asked to name his favorite band. Widespread Panic"" he replied.  He reached over to kiss her lips but she pushed him back stating: ""Please keep your social distance"".  Germany has shut its borders....And to bolster the health of the citizens in its capital Germany is also planning to build a Berlin wall...  There's been such a run on toiletries that convicts can no longer get the bars of soap to make the fake guns for prison breakouts....;)  In a compromise movie theaters will remain open for live audiences but only silent films will be shown...:)  Whats the best way to fight off the virus?...Ask your local D.A. to indict you then ask for Immunity.  Banks are warning that the Coronavirus can be transmitted through dollar bills that those afflicted have handledThe obvious solution to this is money laundering. ;)  Those downplaying the Coronavirus scare are simply washing their hands of it.  Unlike the NBA which quickly suspended its season the NHL tried to have it both ways by suspending and continuing its games at the same time--by putting them on ice...;)  Stone masons confined to work due to the virus face a Quarrytine.  Aging he-man Arnold Schwarzenegger caused a panic when he told a group of fans he was ""still viral"".  The NFL will continue informal workouts; however to cut down on contact it will switch to flag football...Yet today Colin Kaepernick strenuously objected to playing with flags.  Concerned Mexicans are switching from Corona to Dos Equis.  President Trump denies he is a germophobe. ""I actually like Chancellor Merkel"" he says.

I just voted NO on the Continuing Resolution.  One of the most important responsibilities of the House of Representatives is to adequately fund our federal government. Democrats have put that responsibility on the backburner focused all their energy on Bernie Sanders $3.5 trillion spending spree and once again found themselves forced to ram through a last-minute Continuing Resolution to prevent a government shutdown. To make matters even worse Democrats are using this legislation to raise the debt ceiling to pay for their out-of-control federal spending at a time when the United States is nearly $29 trillion in debt.  Our nation is already facing record-high inflation a stagnant economy a humanitarian crisis at our southern border and national security threats from our adversaries following the catastrophic withdrawal from Afghanistan.

Is he dangerous because he gives his salary away and works 24/7 for the American people ? Is he dangerous because he says America first ? Is he dangerous because he wants people to open their businesses and get their jobs back or because he wants the children to go back to school? You are a corrupt fool of a man and he will not play along with you and your party's crooked agenda. Is he dangerous because you are a dangerous socialist idiot and he will not let this country become socialist which is a tried and retried failed and lost form of government ! To you that makes him dangerous.?",political,Facebook
This afternoon I just voted NO on advancing over $4.5 trillion of government spending proposed by the Democrats.  The $3.5 trillion spending bill drafted by Bernie Sanders proposes $68 trillion in total spending over the next decadethe highest sustained federal spending level in American history. At a time when our national debt is approaching $29 trillion and rampant inflation is causing the price of consumer goods to soar Democrats continue to put their left-wing priorities ahead of hard-working Kansans. This legislation would impose a multi-trillion dollar tax hike on middle-class families including Kansas family farms small businesses and energy producers. As the crisis in Afghanistan rages on with no solutions from the administration in sight Democrats want to spend billions on electric vehicles and single-payer healthcare while slashing funding for our troops to the lowest levels in 80 years and providing no increased funding to secure our southern border.  The infrastructure bill is no better. This piece of legislation has a price tag of $1.2 trillion and only spends 6% on roads bridges and highways. Instead of reducing burdensome regulations this bill would make it more difficult for much-needed infrastructure projects in Kansas to move through the federal bureaucracy and red tape. Most importantly this bill is not paid for despite what Democrats want you to believe. According to the Congressional Budget Office roughly $400 billion of the bill is still not paid for. Our county is in desperate need of true infrastructure reform but this bill is not the answer.  The bottom line is that our country faces multiple crises from all angles but throwing more money at the problem will not lead to solutions. It's reckless irresponsible and a raw deal for Kansas taxpayers.,political,Facebook

A few things have come up recently in the news that I have not commented on so this post will be a compilation of several things. If you comment on this post please identify which item you are commenting on. 1. Bernie Sanders is entering the race for President. I am worried that the far swing to the right of the political spectrum will cause a far swing to the left in the next election. Socialism is a failed idea because it incentivises laziness. This is why we need a strong centrist party. 2. Reparations for descendants of slavery are being discussed. I think this is a bad idea for several reasons. First reparations to someone for a wrong that was perpetrated on their ancestors would only be appropriate if the wrong on the ancestor caused them to be worse off than if it was not perpetrated. The descendants of slaves would have been born in subsaharan Africa instead of the greatest nation on earth if their ancestors had not been brought to this country. Slavery was a horrible crime and the victims deserved to be comensated for their suffering. For those who say America should pay for that crime I say she did pay with the worst war in our nations history. The problem of African American poverty in this country is real and should be addressed. This can be done by policies that would encourage companies to develop in statistically poor areas without using race as a determing factor. The problem when race is used in any kind of affirmative action is that it always creates animosity from other races. Economic status should be the factor looked at for programs to help eliminate poverty and not race. 3. Support for Boycott Divestment and Sanctions on Israel is being termed as anti-semitic. I do not agree. If the reason to support the BDS movement is because Israel is a Jewish state then it would be anti-semitic. But if that support is to pressure the government of Israel to work towards solving the problems it has with the Paletinians and Arab world then it is a legitimate mechanism for people around the world to try to influence a government to end oppressive measures much the same way the Boycott movement against South Africa helped to end apartheid.,political,Facebook
Today is a dark dark day in America and we will look back on this day in horror.  Today the United States Senate failed to gather enough votes to move the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act through a procedural vote and on to the floor. What does that mean? It means that when faced with a choice - deliver life-saving medicine to infants who survive failed abortions and are born alive - the United States Senate failed to defend those newborns.  Senate Democrats made it clear to the nation - and the world - that in today's America the Democratic Party is the Party of Death.  All 6 Democratic senators running for president in 2020 - every single one of them - voted against legislation that simply requires physicians to deliver care to any infant that survives an attempted abortion and is delivered alive.  Elizabeth Warren.  Kamala Harris.  Bernie Sanders.  Cory Booker.  Kirsten Gillibrand.  Amy Klobuchar.  Again - all this legislation requires is delivering medical treatment to a living breathing newborn baby in America.  In 2019 in the middle of all the marvels of modern medicine that have average life expectancies soaring and life-threatening diseases declining it is perfectly acceptable in the eyes of the Democratic Party to watch newborn babies die on the table.  Disgusted is an understatement. There are no words to describe this horror.  Only 3 Democrats - THREE - found the moral strength to break with their despicable party and vote with Republicans in support of life.  Today we are calling on all pro-life Americans to join with Restoration PAC and make it clear that we will not let these abhorrent politicians ever forget the horrible choice they made today. Many of them are up for re-election in 2020 and we will do everything we can to make sure that 2020 is the year they lose.  If you agree with what we've laid out before you and will join us in this fight please consider making a contribution today.

Friends Family and Fellow Conservative  Texas District - 13 has been a Republican stronghold for decades producing countless conservative leaders who are dedicated to fighting for individual liberties. However I am deeply saddened to inform you that the conservative legacy of the Lone Star State and our area is in MAJOR peril. Holding on to our Republican stronghold in Texas District - 13 is crucial to our way of life.  Radical liberals like Bernie Sanders Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Elizabeth Warren have claimed to have the strongest grassroots support in the country but Im not buying it. They think the American people want their socialist policies of open borders free healthcare for illegals and the backwards Green New Deal. But theyre dead wrong.  The Left is pouring unending amounts of money into Texas in hopes they will reawaken the ultra-progressive movement that started during the 2018 midterms. We simply CANNOT afford to be complacent in 2020. Will you help us fight back against the far left with a campaign donation today?

Future Shock and Awe - Charlie's Soapbox 6/14/19  I cant bring myself to believe that there arent enough Americans alive who still remember the reality and abject failure of socialism and the wide path of human deprivation and suffering shattered societies and failing dictatorships all socialist governments eventually morph into to stave off the onslaught of socialist presidential candidates that inundate the democrat side of the upcoming election.  I know I do I remember the Iron Curtain the Berlin Wall the people who were shot and killed for nothing more than trying to escape the horrors a totalitarian regime always wreaks on its people the long lines of people in the Soviet Union just trying to procure the basic food and necessities for daily life.  I remember crossing Checkpoint Charlie shortly after the wall started coming down and crossing from a vibrant bustling fashionable West Germany into the colorless dismal streets of East Germany where the people wore worn out threadbare clothes and were suspicious of anyone who approached them a fearful haunted look in their eyes.  Oh theres plenty of information about the disastrous history of socialism. In fact you need to look no farther than Venezuela a country that should be thriving and was until Hugo Chavez brought his idiotic communist ideas and heavy-handed rule and now Venezuela is on the verge of starvation.  But be that as it may even with all the voluminous sources of information on the evils of socialism the current generation thanks to an inadequate and left-leaning educational system does not know about the Soviet Union Eastern Europe and all the other scars socialism has left on history and listen wide-eyed to the promises of a new American Shangri-La where everything is free and all of lifes gnarly problems can be laid at the footstep of an all-powerful nanny state government who would see to their every need from cradle to grave.  I dont believe that America will accept or elect a socialist candidate in this election cycle but if something isnt done about the education of the coming generations there will be a successful socialist candidate sometime in Americas future.  Oh I dont think it would be a crusty old pseudo-communist like Bernie Sanders or a shrill-voiced shrew-like Elizabeth Warren but some even-tempered unflappable young man or woman who does not resort to name calling and political histrionics but simply stays on message proclaiming the universal fairness of a system that makes sure everybody is treated equally.  A person who has been schooled and prepared for the task of selling the masses on the nobility of collectivism. A smooth even-tempered individual who will have all the answers at their fingertips a rebuff for every objection an explanation for every instance of failure the mechanics and mistakes that had turned every other socialist experiment into a disaster.  And this likable sophisticated urbane new face will become the darling of the media and dominate the airwaves the hero of the Hollywood airheads magazine covers and TV specials the wunderkind the hope of America adored by leftist governments around the world.  From each according to his ability to each according to his need  Sounds noble dont it? The words of Karl Marx in 1875 the supposed cornerstone of communism the idealistic phrase that brings it all together perfect fodder for the present-day canon of progressive governance a level playing field for all free college medical care open borders and the rich at last paying their fair share.  But behind all the high-flying phraseology and the inflated promises lies a world that actually differs little in philosophy from the plantation days when a hand full of the elite who wield the power live in splendor with different health care plans different benefit and retirement packages different pay scales and different privileges than the lumped-together one size fits all numbered but unnamed masses who live under their thumb.  God forbid that that day should come but the indications are strong that we are headed in that direction.  A socialist America.  Another deceived nation on the scrap heap of history.  What do you think?  Pray for our troops our police and the peace of Jerusalem  God Bless America  Charlie Daniels,political,Facebook
Student loans are a problem. The current crop of high school graduates are about to take on a crushing load of debt that they may never be able to pay back through no fault of their own. Recent graduates arent the only ones concerned with student loan debt.  Im 51. I borrowed around $75K for undergrad and law school combined. I graduated from law school in 1994. My current balance is just over $157K. Im not alone. Ms. Johnsons tweet and the comments below it are eye-opening:   School tuition has increased substantially since 1958 when student loans became a standard part of college financial aid; 1965 when the government got in the business of subsidizing student loans; and 1976 when they made them non-dischargeable in bankruptcy.  In January of 1976 the average mortgage interest rate in the US was 9.02% and student loan interest at 3.27% was a deal. I bought a house in 2018 and my interest rate is 4.75%. But my student loan interest rate is 8.5%.  Rep. Grothman recently introduced a bill H.R. 5899 to make student loans dischargeable in bankruptcy. But that means that our kids  and our current population of adults already working on paying back student loans  would have to voluntarily destroy their credit rating for a minimum of seven years in order to get out from under a problem that the government caused. Bankruptcy isnt a fair solution (although I grant you its better than none at all).  Elizabeth Warren has introduced legislation regarding debt forgiveness. Bernie Sanders has also introduced legislation regarding student loan forgiveness. Joe Biden has a plan to reduce student debt and forgive it after 20 years of payments.  If solving the student loan debt crisis without forcing people to destroy their credit rating is an issue of importance to Wisconsin voters it should be of importance to Wisconsins representatives. If you send me to Congress it will be.,political,Facebook

To my family friends team endorsers volunteers and supporters thank you so much for standing with me throughout our campaign.  I am so grateful honored and amazed by all we have built together. When I announced that I would run for Congress without taking a dollar from corporations or lobbyists political insiders thought I was crazy. Its never been done in this district. They said too few of working people care enough about politics to fuel a campaign of this scale and we wouldn't even raise $50k to get off the ground.  We proved them wrong. Our message was new bold and clear. We stood up to the biggest corporations and lobbyists in Hawaii to end systemic corruption save our planet and give working people a shot. We shattered the record of individual contributions--raising over $350k from 12500+ individual contributions averaging just $28!  Because of you we brought thousands of regular working people together and set an example of what politics could be--what our future WILL be. Our videos have been viewed over 12 million times on social media setting a national record. We changed American politics and shared our Native Hawaiian and plantation history with the world. On Election Day over 150 volunteers were out in the field at 4am canvassing and sign waving until polls closed at 6pm. No corporate machine couldve mobilized the excitement we have. You are all so incredible.  Campaigns end but movements dont. Barack Obama Brian Schatz and Bernie Sanders all lost their first Congressional races but they showed that through hard work integrity and truth we will get to where we need to be.  So we will not stop; the stakes are too high! We have to have healthcare livable jobs sustainable shorelines education without being strapped in debt dignified housing and a democracy free from corporate corruption.  There are other races organizing opportunities community actions and many fun meaningful ways to get involved. So join us and sign up for next steps as we #FightForAloha:  P.S. - to Khara Jabola-Carolus thank you for changing my life and showing me a new feminist politics of what's possible.  mahal na mahal kita kahit maputi na ang buhok ko.

One thing about American politics (well more than one thing but this I'm particularly grinds my gears) is how politicans when asked about their religion ALWAYS dance around the question or claim their Christians. Trump's done it Obama's done it even my favorite presidential candidate of 2016 Bernie Sanders has done it. It's okay to be an atheist or an agnostic. Will you lose votes if you admit it? Yeah probably. But I'd rather our country's leadership be true to themselves than lie for political gain. It's too bad politicans don't see it that way.,political,Facebook

My response to questions about ActBlue: Since the mailing of my postcard containing Representative Coles endorsement of my campaign I have been asked about another section of the card relating to the group ActBlue and why we care.  ActBlue is not an ordinary online donation processing company.  Act Blue is not PayPal for politics!  Try giving to a Republican candidate on ActBlue. You cant.  ActBlue is a far left wing liberal group out of Massachusetts that was set up for the sole purpose of not just getting Democrats elected but ensuring that they toe the liberal line when they get in office (i.e. that they act Democrat blue).  Google ActBlue Oklahoma candidate list. Youll find a link to this page:  This is a list of all the candidates and organizations in Oklahoma that ActBlue is supporting this election cycle. There are four pages worth of candidates and organizations ActBlue supports in Oklahoma. You wont find a single Republican on there.  What you will find are groups that you can donate to like Our Revolution the Bernie Sanders-led PAC.  Or how about NARAL Pro-Choice America  a radical PAC thats even more pro-abortion than Planned Parenthood.  But dont worry. ActBlue supports Planned Parenthood too.  Dont just take my word for it. Google theses groups and see what they are about and what they stand for. You wont like it.  Try giving to the National Right to Life Committee on ActBlue. You cant.  The story is the same on ActBlue pages for states across the country.  You will find that ActBlue supports candidates like Nancy Pelosi Elizabeth Warren Maxine Waters Bernie Sanders and any other far left wing liberal you can imagine. Try giving to their Republican opponents on ActBlue (aka PayPal according to Brandon Thompson). You cant.  By accepting ActBlues backing and support Brandon Thompson has aligned himself with the most far left wing elements of the Democrat Party. If Thompson is willing to do this in his campaign and then try to mislead you about it hell do the same as our Representative at the Capitol.  Anyone can send out fancy campaign cards with conservative talking points. But actions speak louder than words. And Brandon Thompsons actions speak clearly that at the Capitol he would - ActBlue!  Heres more background on ActBlue:  ActBlue is a non-profit SuperPAC that supports and gives money to primarily socialist liberals who could not raise much money. Its primary beneficiaries have been Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton after she Defeated Bernie.  ActBlue is a Massachusetts based SuperPAC and is funded by providing online credit card processing and charging the candidate just a little extra as well as giving the donor the option to tip ActBlue when donating. They have raised 2.9 billion dollars since being founded in 2004. Then they divert the profits thru the PAC to individuals who in my personal opinion do not posses Oklahoma values such as Bernie Sanders.  In summation ActBlue is a nonprofit SuperPAC founded by two east cost liberals in 2004. The SuperPAC provides expensive online processing to Democrats running for office all over our country. They then take the profits of the service and support campaigns of candidates that couldnt otherwise raise enough money to be competitive due to their socialist liberal political platform such as Bernie and Angus King.  As a side note my opponent being involved in the banking industry he is well aware that this is going on and how things really work.  Knowingly diverting one nickel of the money good people have given to him should disqualify him getting anyones support to be a legislator in Oklahoma.,political,Facebook
"The fake news MSM do not realize that the people have realized how fake they are. For years they delivered their fake news subtly and acted "" impartial"" and pretended to have no bias. however after the election of President Trump they could no longer hide their prejudices and their propaganda and misinformation . Trump's victory infuriated them and made them come out of the woodworks. They could no longer tolerate hiding their lack of objectivity and complete partisan ideology. They are without doubt bought and paid for by the democrat machinery of government and it has been so for decades. CNN MSNBC The Washington Post The New York Times  ABC NBCCBS and so many more are an arm of the corrupt democrat party.  For decades they tried to at least show a neutral front. No longer it's out in the open they know it and most people know it. the only ones who do not know this fact are ignorant lazy unaware idiots. The democrats all know this as a fact. They no longer try to hide it or can hide it. This latest fraud vote by mail so blatantly obvious intended to cheat the system and rig the elections. Their gamesmanship is totally in the open. They do not even hide it or pretend otherwise. The main reason is that they no longer are accountable to the voters. They have enough fools to vote for them and to keep them in office.  Those that still think that they are hiding it from the ""aware"" voter or citizen have their heads buried in the sand but their bare asses are up in the air naked and visible to all observers. They are so stupid and so corrupt that THEY don't realize this fact.  I am talking of the Rachel maddows the Juan Williams the Donna Braziles the Don Lemons the Anderson Coopers and the Chris Cuomos and the Chris Wallaces and the Jake Tappers and the wolf Blitzers and the Brian Stelters and the Dana Bashes Erin Burnetts Jim Acostas Gloria Borgers Fareed Zakarias Jeffery Toobins and so many many more.

They would be offended not to be mentioned in this list of journalist or hosts or news casters or news anchors or hosts or really FRAUDS which is the best word that describes them. Add to this list corrupt career politicians in power for decades. Pelosi Schumer Schiff Maxine Waters Jerry Nadler Joe Biden John Kerry The Clintons Bernie Sanders and again so many more including the new ones ""the squad"" Ilhan omar Rashida Tlaib AOC and Ayanna Pressley. I call them "" the gang of four"". The original gang of four where 4 advisers to Mao Zedong and controlled the power organs of the communist party of China through the later stages of the Cultural Revolution. Sound Familiar ?  They are all part of exposed and corrupt news organizations and part of the machinery of deceit and the failed democrat party.  Then we come to democrat run cities and states governors and mayors. Mayor De Blasio mayor Garcetti mayor Lori Lightfoot Jenny Durkan Ted WheelerJacob Frey London Breed. The governors include Andrew Cuomo Gavin Newsom J.B. Pritzker Gretchen Whitmer Ralph NorthamTim Walz and so many other failed democrat cities and states.

"I'm going to vote for Bernie Sanders again this year I'm in. This hasn't been an easy decision. I think mainly because I got so beat-up and bullied by sanctimonious establishment Democrats and foaming-at the-mouth fascist T-rumplicans last time that I wasn't sure I wanted to let anyone know. To quote my good trucker-folk-singer friend and this comes directly from the book of McAbee:  ""Voting for Bernie Sanders because: 1. He's the overwhelming choice of the generation of young adults who'll be most affected by the next 4 years and... 2. He is almost entirely public-funded with no corporate obligations. I don't necessarily like everything he stands for and I shouldn't. That's now how this works.""  Salient points to be sure but my motivation is less altruistic and more classically American if you know what I mean. During the Great Depression President Roosevelt lifted the spirits of Americans by providing guaranteed jobs for many people but specifically and in reference to my own selfish interests he also helped create the Federal Art Project of the Works Progress Commission which funded many tens of thousands of artworks across the country. I can see that not only is our country's infrastructure crumbling but so is our morale. Art is good for that among many other things it lifts our spirits to heights thankfully imaginable. Also I've longed for an opportunity to become more of an art entrepreneur and with health-care for profit as the norm I wouldn't dare jump all the way into doing that it's so expensive as to be prohibitive for daring ventures like art making. The American health care system was formerly public until President Ronald Reagan privatized it into the disquieting money making machine that it is today and that needs to change.  As my good gun-toting ATM-refilling friend's wife observed (a brave Annishanabe/Ojibwe librarian the dangerous type apparently if we are to believe one of the southern states) Bernie's oratory may be a bit gruff for these times. We expect our candidates to be perfect but they aren't gods they're human beings just like us. I paraphrased that bit from her take. Also for balance and clarity I believe she's still on the fence which is where I was a short while ago. It's good to have smart friends its as good to finally stake a stand. Come on and get some.  So this was inspired not only by my friends but also by an Edgar Allen Poe nightmare I just woke up from. That classic picture of his long-haired mug was chasing me around some expansive protoplasmic arena while I screamed until I shouted ""This ends now!"" True story paw-to-god-I-scat-you-not (<<<Dry Bar Comedy reference). Or maybe as Edgar would have it:  ""All That We See Or Seem Is But A Dream Within A Dream.""  Anyway kind reader if you care to comment be my guest. I don't believe I am able to moderate them at this time though my heart is very heavy right now. Just keep it civil and by civil I don't mean avoid vulgarities I mean attack the argument not each other's character. Or like they say in the movies if you don't like my music get the fuck outta' my cab.  This statement is dedicated to my friends working on the non-partisan Fair Maps Project. End gerrymandering now!

Never in history has there ever been so much desire by some citizens to destroy a freedom based constitutional republic. A republic with fredoom of speech religion & numerous other fredoms. The freedom to criticize the President the government officials at all levels & the government in general.The freedom to spit on the flag & to burn it & the freedom to not respect the national anthem in public. Such behavior or will to destroy the country does not exist in the worst totalitarian regimes in the world. Not in China not in Cuba not in Russia  not in Iran & not in Venezuela or North Korea.They do not exist in any other country in the world. Not in most of the Middle East Africa South America other parts of asia and even some of Europe. It is obvious now that excess liberty is poisonous and leads to chaos and erosion of the very liberties that allow that behavior in the first place. Many before us have warned us of this. Complaining & acting as victims is a product of democracy. Everyone is complaining and is disgruntled. They act like really spoiled children except they are vicious spoiled manipulative adults most of them with an agenda and most of them extremely ignorant of reality. Multi millionaire athletes complain actors and actresses complain major celebrities complain talk show hosts complain career politicians who have controlled everything for years complain mayors & governors complain. Now even The President & Vice president and some generals and tech billionaires complain. Greta Thunberg came from Sweden to america to complain. Ilhan Omar came from Somalia as a refugee to complain how bad it is here. Rashida Tlaib the daughter of Palestinian immigrants complains as a first generation American. Our two term first black President first generation American complained. Do peopel just come here to complain ? Why do you come would be a logical question would it not ? We already have the multitude of American born complainers like AOC and Pressley & Hillary & Bernie Sanders & Pelosi & BLM & Antifa & a whole bunch of other white & black complainers.Maxine Waters can complain like a million people just herself alone.Barbara Streisand & Jane Fonda always complained. The people who have every right to complain & to burn & destroy namely the homeless & the broken & destitute war veterans & the really poor & sick drug addicts never complain. CNN & MSNBC & all of the MSM are constantly complaining too including The Washington Post & The New York times. Twitter is a complaint & grievance airing machine. God almighty if this place is as bad & as racist & homophobic & xenophobic & as oppressive as these people complaining say so why do millions of people try to come here ?,political,Facebook

"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL'S MISLEADING ASSAULT ON SOCIALISM  The WSJ's Editorial Board  recently published a piece entitled: ""Defining Down Socialism"" (June 14). This misleading opinion piece accuses Bernie Sanders of misrepresenting his so-called socialist agenda through linking it to Franklin Delano Roosevelt's (FDR's) social programs; this in a supposed effort to make socialism palatable to the American people. The Editorial Board's own misrepresentations during this effort should not be left unchallenged.  The editorial distinguishes Bernie Sanders' proposals from ""FDRs social programs [which] were based on the principle of work in return for benefits"" which by implication suggest that socialist are looking for benefits without a corresponding work obligation. I know of no Socialist: Christian Marxist or otherwise and presumably Bernie Sanders in light of his proposal for a federal jobs guarantee who would seek social benefits without a corresponding social contribution in the form of a work effort. Quite the contrary is true. Socialism is a full employment system the opposite of what is apparently achievable in the capitalistic context--notwithstanding claims of full employment at the tail-end of the economic cycle. Arguably most U.S. Socialist merely seek a decent standard of living in return for their work effort.  Next the Journal accuses Bernie Sanders of sidestepping the assumed failures of socialist leaning and socialist states such as Venezuela and Cuba. We will never know the potential success these two nations may have achieved if left unencumbered by U.S. efforts to undermine these regimes. There is plenty of evidence to suggest that the U.S. through various proxies funnelled funds to both grow opposition groups to former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and to organize their cooperation in an effort to remove the socialist leaning President from power. This early during the Chavez Administration culminated in the 2002-2003 national general strike which led to Chavez's brief overthrow through a military coup: a coup which was undone when en masse Venezuela's impoverished indigenous population took to the streets to demand his return. Upon his return to power Chavez seeking to undercut the forces responsible for his ouster fired half of the employees at Venezuela's massive state owned oil firm PDVSA--the epicenter of much anti-Chavez dissent. As oil goes so goes Venezuela. The brain-drain associated with the purge undoubtedly greatly damaged the state owned firm and is partially responsible for the firm's current state of disarray. Admittedly the regime also failed to adequately re-invest in the giant oil firm. The point here however is that without U.S. intervention perhaps the lasting damage of Chavez's early traumatic years might not be with us today.  The WSJ piece in an effort to emphasize Venezuela's more recent economic struggles also fails to mention that under Chavez rates of poverty and illiteracy declined significantly while Venezuela's democratic participation rate increased when compared to Venezuela's previous neoliberal regime. Any follower of events in Venezuela undoubtedly understands the ongoing and recent U.S. efforts to undermine Maduro's economic regime.  In terms of Cuba the U.S. has imposed trade embargos against Cuba since 1960. It is a fairly weak argument from the U.S. perspective to claim that international trade which harnesses the power of comparative advantage is requisite to national prosperity and then to prohibit the Cuban nation from participation in this powerful mechanism followed by the proclamation apparently in agreement with WSJ's Editorial Board that the failure of the Cuban economy is related to its socialist structure rather than its inability to freely trade. The same offense has been leveled against Venezuela and a host of other socialist leaning nations against whom the U.S. has employed this technique.  An additional weak spot in the Journal's opinion piece relates to Bernie Sanders' endorsement of Medicare for All. The piece claimed that the Medicare for All Proposal would undoubtedly require a middle class tax increase. Perhaps this is true. But the argument ignores the very likely scenario that a tax increase if necessary would likely be significantly lower than the cost paid by middle-class people or their employers for current private healthcare coverage: cost which would be eliminated through the Medicare for All proposal. This result is significantly due to the high administrative expenses associated with the current U.S. private healthcare system: cost which when combined with other inefficiencies within the American system leads to U.S. healthcare cost which are near double the healthcare cost of those nations which provide universal care.  The Journal's straight news reporting despite its expected biases is among the best the Nation has to offer. Its Editorial's however are generally predictable; which is to be expected but blatant disregard of legitimate convincing and well known counter opinion even within the Journal's Opinion section from the Journal itself no less would hopefully fall below the Journal's otherwise fairly high although predictably biased standards. It serves merely to generate greater mistrust within the national dialogue and further hampers efforts to mediate opposing views.",political,Facebook

Why does socialism always fail?  Socialism is all the rage among leftists these days. Bernie Sanders is always talking about how he wants democratic socialism which I guess is the type of socialism in which you vote to steal someone elses property. Also you have heard how socialism always fails and the likes of Venezuela is trotted out with a video of persons digging in the back of a garbage truck looking for food. Why does socialism always fail? Its not as difficult to understand as you might think. You dont need an economics degree to understand economics. You dont need a degree of any kind actually. All you need is an understanding of human behavior.  Socialism is anti-freedom and always fails for two primary reasons. First is that it doesnt respect personal property in all its forms which destroys personal initiative. Personal property exists in many forms. This includes but is not limited to tangible financial intellectual and physical labor. Whatever it is that you call yours is your personal property. Put more specifically it destroys the desire to create wealth because If there are no guarantees that what you have created is yours to keep then whats the point?  Second it destroys personal responsibility. If you know the government is going to take care of you you will have absolutely no motivation to work to take care of yourself. Not being a burden to others is one of the most moral things you can do but just waiting on that check provided with someone elses blood sweat and tears is much easier.  Prosperity doesnt grow on trees nor does it spontaneously erupt from nothing. Prosperous societies are created with the free exchange of excess personal property that is created with personal initiative and responsibility and this improves the lives of everyone. Socialism fails because it halts the free trade of personal property because there is very little personal property to trade. When free trade stops prosperity stops. When everything belongs to everybody nobody is responsible for anything. A society prospers when every person possible is working tirelessly to improve their situation to the maximum degree possible which will in turn improve the situation of others. Its just that simple.,political,Facebook
"No words  That was my reaction in the first minutes after hearing about the murder of Jews in Pittsburgh. However after a few minutes the words came to me .... in droves.  Having 5 children with 2 brit Milah and 3 baby naming ceremonies it certainly wasn't hard to imagine the horror of this happening. However I AM NOT SURPRISED IN THE LEAST BIT. Antisemitism has been with us since the time of the Pharaohs. It was only a matter of time before we as a community experienced what other communities in our country have the horror of a movie theater being shot up the hate towards a Black Church the gunning down of a church filled with mostly white people praying.  Jews have been easy targets. This deranged person who railed about the all-powerful Jews bringing invaders in to kill ""our people"". A lunatic spewing holocaust conspiracy theories. The same people who perpetrated the biggest crime against humanity in history are the same ones that deny that it happened.  The irony of this is that these delusional racists usually go after the least powerful women children 80-year old's praying in a service Our services speak of peace love responsibility yet to this demented person who harbored such hate viewed them as part of his paranoid views of Jews and Judaism.  Now the hard part. A big part of my anger is the response by many to this senseless tragedy.  Pete Beinart: The Special Kind of hate that Drove Pittsburgh Shooter - And Trump.  Jane Eisner also of the forward ""What has Trump Done to Us America?  The Washington Post: How much responsibility does Trump bear for the synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh?  Then there are the many cable pundits guests and Democrat leaders who spoke of the ""environment of hate"" fomented by the President. How ironic that statement is since the Democrats have never accepted him as President and have been fomenting hatred since a minute after he won the election.  It is utter nonsense that Trump had anything to do with this on any level. This man was a pure unadulterated Nazi and a Trump hater.  Did any of you blame Obama for the shootings that occurred at the Jewish Community Center of Kansas City in 2014?  Did you see any of these people criticize Bernie Sanders when one his supporters shot up a baseball game of Republicans? Where was and is the criticism of Maxine Waters who said "" ""Let's make sure we show up wherever we have to show up. And if you see anybody from that Cabinet in a restaurant in a department store at a gasoline station you get out and you create a crowd. And you push back on them. And you tell them they're not welcome anymore anywhere.""  Where is the criticism of Hillary Clinton who recently said ""Democrats can't be civil right now""?  Where is the criticism of Eric Holder who said 'When they go low we kick them? That's what this new Democrat Party is about.'  All these statements are in context of violence against specific Republicans people wearing Making America great hats harassment of administration officials wherever they are in airports in restaurants.  There was NO criticism of these statements and actions by the Democratic leadership. In short they created an environment of hatred of violence and of harassment. Most importantly WHERE ARE THESE PARAGONS OF VIRTUE WHO HAVE VIRTUALLY SAID NOTHING ABOUT LOUIS FARRAKHAN'S CONTINUED SPEWING OF ANTISEMITISM?  UNLESS YOU ALL THINK THAT CALLING JEWS TERMITES IS NOT A PROBLEM.  It is disgusting for these people to use this tragedy for political purposes. There was plenty of anti-Semitic attacks mass shootings during the time of Obama did anyone blame him for creating the ""environment"" for this to happen? I would add that in my opinion Obama purposely fanned the flames of hatred during his many speeches against the 1 per-centers and corporate jet owners. What about Obama's use of local cases like Michael Brown in St Louis and others to suit his narrative about white hatred and police brutality? Gee where did all of those go since Trump became President?  Hate is Hate is Hate. Whenever you demonize any group whether it is Jews blacks the wealthy Muslims Republicans Trump they are dehumanized made into caricatures and they become targets especially for the mentally disturbed.  I know what some of you are thinking. President Trump is a racist didn't he say that there are good Nazis? NO HE DIDN'T IT IS A LIE TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT. ANYBODY WHO ACTUALLY TAKES THE TIME TO SEE THE NEWS CONFERENCE IN THE LOBBY OF TRUMP TOWER KNOWs WHAT HE WAS SAYING. He was responding to a flurry of questions. What about some context here? He criticized the Nazis then criticized Antifa who are violent anarchists. He CLEARLY was referring to there being good people on both sides of the CONFEDERATE STATUE ISSUE. He said ""where does this stop do we take down the Jefferson memorial because he had slaves?"" I personally have mixed feelings about the statues yes some should be removed because they were political statements about Jim Crow etc. however there are historical statues that should remain. Does that make me a Nazi? I DON'T THINK SO.  The President gave a clear unequivocal heart-felt statement about what happened in Pittsburgh about the scourge of Antisemitism and about the Jewish people. More importantly did ANY OF YOU ACTUALLY WATCH THE REACTION OF THE CROWD TO WHAT HE WAS SAYING? THEY WERE APPLAUDING WHAT HE WAS SAYING. SO MUCH FOR HIS BASE BEING ANTI SEMITIC. Pence's speech on the subject received the same applause.  The Forward and the left have been calling him an anti-Semite since he ran for President. That is the default answer to anyone that they disagree with. You are a racist and or an anti-Semite. It is nonsense. If you disagree with unfettered illegal immigration to our country YOU ARE A RACIST. If you want common sense answers to this problem that every President prior to Trump had to deal with YOU ARE A RACIST. Even though most of our ""courageous"" current leadership like Schumer Hillary Clinton Pelosi Feinstein all spoke out vociferously against ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.  Trumps immigration action calling for restricting refugees from certain Muslim countries was BASED ON A PLAN BY THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. Yes these were the countries that Obama felt were dangerous.  This President has done more for Jews and Israel than any of our ""friends"" like Roosevelt (who was an anti-Semite and did nothing to help the Jews. Roosevelt knew that Jews were being slaughtered in Germany). Even worse Roosevelt wanted to disperse the survivors after the war to different ends of the earth. Look it up it is true.  The ""first Jewish President"" as the New Yorker called Obama was the most hostile to Israel and I would argue to Jews ever. Yet the progressive Jewish community loved him. In case you didn't notice Progressive Jews ISRAEL IS MADE UP OF JEWS.  This President has done what no other President has he and his surrogate Nikki Haley spoke truth to power at the UN treated terrorists and terrorists' entities like they should be with disdain and publicly defended Israel. His actions speak louder than his words.  Now let's talk about his words. I don't defend everything that he does and says. Like many I often feel that his tweets are not Presidential however in his own ingenious way he communicates directly to his base without the filter of a very left leaning media.Really did he need to call Stormy a ""horse face"" ?  There is a rally today at the Jewish Center. It should be a cathartic feel good event for our community but the reality is that it will also be a time of bashing the President calling for gun control (which didn't stop the pipe bombs that the other demento sent) and ending up doing nothing for our community.  What we really need is to clamp down on social media like twitter Facebook. We need to profile and remove real threats to our community without disrupting real political speech. That includes shutting down sites like storm-front. We need to remove every page that espouses hatred antisemitism. Yes Anti-Israel hate speech should be removed as well without removing true criticism. We need our community leaders including Rabbis to stop being political and call out anti-Semitism wherever they say it even if it is from the progressive community and Democrats. We need to publicly shame and criticize places of business like the Haunted Hoochie a local haunted house that opens every Halloween. They host a swastika Saturday where anyone who wears a swastika gets in free. Where is the public condemnation from our leaders? In our OWN BACK YARD?  As long as there are human beings on earth you will have hate. Our community is not the vulnerable community of the 1930s. Wake up and get protection at every synagogue. We are not Europe there is no major influx of people who hate us at least not recently. Jews need to get their concealed carries train and protect themselves. Fight back zero tolerance for antisemitism in all forms including harassment of our children at Universities. That is how we win we live.  This is what Israel must live through every day. Free societies and its most vulnerable need to realize that we are all human beings and that we need to stick together. Hate is Hate is Hate on both sides.

Today my opponent sent out a mailer claiming that I oppose President Trump. The mailer contains a fake photo-shopped picture of me wearing an anti Trump shirt. Fact: I've never worn an anti Trump shirt. The actual picture was taken back in 2015 before Trump had even become President and I was wearing a Royals T-shirt. I was attending a Royals baseball game. I took a picture with my uncle who was wearing a Bernie Sander's t-shirt.  It's extremely disappointing that my opponent would stoop to these types of tactics and send out a mailer that contains a photo- shopped picture. I've run a positive civil campaign and have focused on my positions on the issues and a positive vision for our state.

If you are looking for a candidate with a backbone of steel who will take YOUR voice to congress and not lobbyists voice to you. Vote Micah Beckwith on May 5th.  1) If you are Pro-Life and outraged that 41 democratic senators value human life so little that they won't protect a child who is born during a botched abortion and you want someone who will FIGHT for the unborn vote Micah Beckwith.  2) If you are tired of your constitutional rights being trampled on by corrupt politicians and increased legislation whether it be your second amendment rights freedom of speech freedom of religion or any other right you have and you want someone who will fight to protect our God given rights as American citizens vote Micah Beckwith.  3) If you are tired of being bludgeoned to death by an increased tax burden whether rich middle class or poor and are terrified Bernie Sanders will come in and take all your hard earned money vote Micah Beckwith. He is THE candidate who believes in a smaller more fiscal government AND wants to decrease everyone's tax liability.  4) There are a million reasons to cast your vote SOLELY for Micah Beckwith but the one many of us care about most is keeping our freedom of religion protected.

Our statement on Bernie Sanders and Linda Sarsour:  Progressive values demand a commitment to working tirelessly to build a more equitable America. Progressives by definition seek to make progress in the fight against bigotry no matter what community is being targeted. As progressives we know that when any community is attacked we are all attacked. We know that in America today there is an incredible amount of work to do on this front and so many others.  And as progressives we are disheartened to say the least to see progressive Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders bringing Linda Sarsour one of the most divisive individuals on the American political sceneand that says a lot in today's environmentinto his campaign in an official capacity. Our country is broken and the Jewish community is one of many that is constantly attacked and exploited as a political weapon. Instead of recognizing the pervasiveness of this problem Sanders has elevated an individual who has done so much to alienate American Jews from our natural ideological home demonized the very vast majority of us who believe in our own liberation in the form of Zionism and proudly celebrated one of America's most notorious antisemitic figures Reverend Louis Farrakhan.  There are extraordinary activists from every corner of this great country who represent the full diversity of the progressive community. There are leaders who work to uniteto bridge the seemingly chasmic but nevertheless artificial divides between all of our marginalized groups. There are endless options for campaign surrogates who will make American Jews proud of our roots and our historic leadership in the progressive movement. Linda Sarsour is not one of them. Bernie Sanders should know better and must do better.  Zioness exists because our community needs real leaders who will not demand that we American Jews abandon our identities as Zionists in order to be safe and welcome in domestic movements for social racial economic and gender justice. We will not submit to a pernicious false choice applied only to our community: We will continue to be both unabashedly progressive and unapologetically Zionist with full conviction in our commitment to all parts of our authentic selves. And we will not stand silently in the face of antisemitism or anti-Zionism. Neither should anyone seeking to hold the office of the President of the United States.,political,Facebook
The Tall Hat Telegraph Top Ten Travel Advisory In A Time of Trumpet.  1) Traveling abroad as a US citizen have always been a bit dodgy. There was a time right after WWII that was pretty sweet and under Obama it was so-so. Now youre pretty much stuck w/ Cape Cod or one of those Alaskan cruises your granny went on last year.  2) If you insist on going abroad remember to make up a good cover story. Like youre checking out countries to live in until #45 is impeached or pretend to be a volunteer for the Bernie Sanders election campaign (a list of acceptable candidates is available upon request). The days of simply slapping a Canadian flag on your backpack are over eh!  3) If youre entering the US do not wear your national garb unless it involves a ten gallon hat & cowboy boots and/or a hoodie from a top 50 US jock college.  4) If you have a heavy foreign accent dont test the comprehension skills of the TSA. Use as few words as possible. Screeners look at virtually naked people all day and get testy when faced w/ ambiguity and things they dont know.  5) If you have 2 or more pieces of carry-on luggage you might get away with it if you A) serve in the armed forces of a G7 country B) show a lot of cleavage and wear bitching heels C) carry a screaming baby and mutter under your breath like youre about to blow. Be advised that crazy mommy is pretty much the only kind of crazy the TSA will remotely tolerate.  6) If youre Dutch youll get pulled aside and searched no exceptions! We all love Amsterdam but still feel resentful for all those years you enjoyed free pot way ahead of Alaska California Colorado Illinois Maine Massachusetts Michigan Nevada Oregon Vermont and Washington.  7) If you must wear your MAGA hat through security follow these easy steps: 1) dont talk to the other travelers and look down and look ashamed because you should be! 2) dont draw any more attention to yourself by raising your voice laughing or breathing loudly and chew with your ******* mouth closed! 3) dont eat anything out of the transit area unless its prepared by the #45 re-election campaign and even then....I just dont get how you expect to eat clean food ever again.  8) If you have extra long legs you might alleviate the discomfort in Economy class by injecting your thighs with Novocain prior to boarding. This way you also get to board first in the courtesy wheelchair.  9) Wearing a MAGA hat in a foreign country is literally showcasing your gullibility. Just remember to always laugh w/ people even when theyre laughing at you! And dont eat any of the local food and expect to pay five times the going price...oh wait you do that already!  10) And finally using your words or logic in the face of an unreasonable request by a TSA officer is like bringing a dictionary to a Trump rally just saying.,political,Facebook
"The Week in Trumpism  This weeK:  -- Trump met with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. Trump said he was very proud to hear the racist homophobic anti-indigenous Bolsonaro use the term ""fake news.""  -- A study came out showing that hate crimes increase in towns after a Trump rally is held there.  -- Laura Ingraham tweeted out a picture of an recently hired adjunct professor at NYU calling her a ""journo-terrorist.""  --Maxine Waters reports that she has gotten four death threats since Trump took office.  -- The Customs and Border Protection Bureau detained a 9 year old US citizen for 30 hours. The younger child provided inconsistent information during her inspection"" said a spokesperson.  This is all on Benedict Donald. None of this would have happened with Bernie Sanders Hillary Clinton or Marco Rubio as president. Trump's denigration of the truth his demagoguery on race and immigration (and his political opponents) and his lack of interest in improving the welfare of others are taking root and sprouting (admittedly on ground that was already fertile).  I've long maintained that while the policy impacts of Individual #1's presidency may be limited (and they mostly have been on the domestic front) the less tangible impacts were potentially huge. Rifts that had been welded shut have been opened. It may feel good to say that it is better to have them open but most of the people saying that are on the comfortable side of those rifts or don't remember our history when they were not rifts but chasms.

"Green New Steal - Charlie's Soapbox 4/12/19  I remember back when Haight-Ashbury was the mecca of the peace and love movement and much of the philosophy vernacular and rhetoric that was endlessly repeated around the country had their origins amongst the long-haired beaded and bearded flower children who hung out there and other counter culture hot spots in hippie-friendly San Francisco.  Some of them were sincere young people who were watching the only world they would ever have come apart at the seams and set out to do something about it demonstrating their disapproval by dropping out and turning on writing protest songs and supporting political candidates who were most closely aligned with their vision.  As I said some of them were sincere and held deep beliefs but some were violent revolutionaries some were hangers-on nut jobs like the Charles Manson cult and the majority were just along for the ride the loose sexual mores and ready availability of drugs.  Most of this latter group neither understood nor believed in the causes the faithful held so dear but to be a part of the crowd adopted the dress lingo and politics of those they considered to be hip.  So the hippie movement was probably something like 20 percent sincere idealism and 80 percent also-rans and even amongst the totally committed the pipe dreams got a little far out. I remember hearing a member of a famous rock band make the statement we can stop wars before they start.  In other words the hippie movement was long on idealistic aspirations and woefully short on realistic fulfillment.  I am a firm believer that all grandiose undertakings begin with a dream but even dreams must submit to the law of possible and impossible and preventing a monster like Adolph Hitler or some fever minded radical from going to war with a song and a smile is about as likely as Bernie Sanders winning the Masters.  I said all that to say all this.  We have presidential candidates and members of Congress who to use an analogy want to go to war armed with an out of tune guitar and badly-written unfinished song.  The very title Green New Deal strikes a chord in the hearts of all impressionable young people who have swallowed the lie that the planet will end in twelve years if it isnt implemented.  On the surface it sounds like the answer to all our ecological problems but lets take a look below the water where all the Leviathans of reality lurk.  First of all the theory of abolishing the internal combustion engine in ten to twelve years is tantamount to insanity even to do it in 50 years would be a monumental undertaking and the idea that all our planes civilian and military would be grounded would be music to the ears of our enemies theyd just wait ten years and destroy us.  We would be helpless no cars no trucks no trains not even missiles which have enteral combustion engines to shoot back with.  The cost as estimated by Forbes magazine:  Switching over to 100% renewables: $2 trillion over the next 10 years around $200000000 per year.  Smart power grid $400 billion over ten years.  Drawing down greenhouse gases $11 trillion over 10 years.  Upgrade every home to new energy efficiency $2.5 Trillion over 10 years.  Universal single payer healthcare system 1.4 trillion per year although some estimates have gone as high $3.2 trillion over 10 years for a Medicare for all plan.  So the minimum cost over ten years would be something like $2.5 trillion per year. The total 2018 budget was a little over $4 trillion so it would at the very least double the already in debt budget every year.  Proponents claim that raising taxes would counter the deficit but even with an unacceptably large tax increase it would not begin to cover the shortfall.  Another suggestion is that we print enough money to offset the lack of funds but as has been proven over and over the kind of money that would have to be printed would bring on the kind of hyperinflation no nation can handle.  So here we are with a gaggle of unrealistic politicians who will promise anything to get elected a constituency of young people naive enough to believe their promises and an unpredictable electorate that could jump either way.

An Alarming Thing - Charlie's Soapbox 2/22/19  There is a most alarming thing going on in America a slimy poisonous lie that must hide in the darkness of misconceptions the fog of deceit and misrepresentation to exist. It can never be exposed to the light of full disclosure and total truth or it would be suffocated by the knowledge of its history and catastrophic ramifications.  Due to the failure of our educational system a media that no longer leans to the left but has completely lost its footing and fully fallen head over heels in that direction our ignoring the old adage learn from history or be doomed to repeat it and the apostasy so prevalent in todays society millennium America and the old red contingency of our population have fallen for the big lie.  Bernie Sanders kick-started the new fascination with socialism in the 2016 election when he built his presidential hopes on openly embracing a system that has been destroying societies and governments for a century  Bernie promised free college health care for all free this free that with the government picking up the tab and providing the funds for this federal largesse by taxing the wealthy an old worn out liberal slogan that never covers the catastrophic short falls of cash and if seen through to its logical conclusion turns from tax to confiscate.  Bernie drew a lot of attention but he never had a chance at the nomination just another casualty of the Clinton political machine.  But Bernie is back well-funded and more determined than ever except now some of the new gaggle of Democrats who are dipping their toes in the waters make Bernie Sanders almost look like a staunch conservative by comparison.  The promises the current class of Democrat contenders are making are ridiculous and unkeepable.  The Green New Deal alone would bankrupt this nation do irreparable damage to foreign policy put America in an untenable security position wiping out whole segments of the economy in one fell swoop shrinking our military stifling commerce and reducing the dollar to a worthless piece of paper.  The first day that it was known for sure that it would be implemented the stock market would fall through the floor businesses would begin making preparations to move offshore and the super-rich would relocate taking their wealth with them.  Basically no matter what Bernie and his acolytes do with or without the Green New Deal they would not be able to raise enough revenue to create this Utopian Great Society and would blame it on outside forces and right-wing resistance and promise that next year they will do better.  But the truth of the matter is that they will never do any better they will never be able to provide free college health care for all monthly checks for 100% of the population cradle to grave everything for everybody.  Why?  Because it simply is not possible.  Look at it like this imagine that youre dealing with a stack of bricks. You start out with a broad base on the bottom and you start pulling bricks out of the solid foundation and placing them on the flimsy top of the pile.  What happens?  Its obvious you eventually pull one too many bricks out of the bottom the foundation becomes unstable and unbalanced and the whole thing comes crashing to the ground.  You simply cant have fewer and fewer people and industries carrying a monolithic entitlement class on their shoulders.  Dont take my word the information and history on the abject failure of socialism is well documented. Check it out for yourself you might want to start with Venezuela.  Most socialist nations eventually become dictatorships cruel dictatorships because hungry deprived people get angry and the only way to keep them in line is with fear and intimidation.  And have you heard even one socialist Democrat presidential candidate mention anything about God His divine guidance or even His slightest participation in their grandiose schemes?  No because a socialist government is supposed to have and be the answer to all things and cannot coexist with the freedom autonomy and sense of justice followers of Almighty God believe in religious faith must be stamped out and redirected toward the state.  Socialism is not about doing good for people it is about power about an all-pervasive government that controls every aspect of its citizens lives consigning them to a colorless mundane hand to mouth existence while the ruling class fly around in private jets and live in splendor. Thats the big lie about socialism it doesnt make everyone equal it just transfers money to those in control.  Socialism is basically baby communism and when it becomes full grown it is an evil godless human attempt at totalitarianism.  It has never created anything but misery  Defeat it America or it will defeat you.  Pray for our troops our police and the peace of Jerusalem  What do you think?  God bless America  Charlie Daniels,political,Facebook
Thank you Bernie Sanders! While you will never be president you have created a million people like yourself all over this country like myself.  This week's elections have proven there is a massive mandate for loud and aggressive leaders fighting for a single-payer healthcare system and a green new deal.  Recently I've been knocking doors and speaking to the voters. If I can get my name recognition up the question is whether our progressive agenda will win by single or double digits come August 4th.  But I can't do it without you. I'm only $375 away from buying my mailers. You don't have to be a millionaire to make a difference any amount will make a difference. Your gift of $10 $25 $50 $100 $250 $500 or however much you can afford will get us closer to our goal.

"Bernie Sanders has been the leading candidate since 2016. I have no doubt this will be his year. I'll take a candidate w/ 2 stents in his heart over a sitting President w/ 2 articles of Impeachment.  For anyone who says ""but the economy is doing well"" you can't take your $ with you. And most Americans are NOT better off financially or w/ respect to their health. Why is it so scary to say our nation should be defined by the quality of life we provide for ALL citizens?  Bernie's also the best on climate change. Any sane parent I've ever talked to wants to leave a habitable planet for their children by any means necessary.  Yes this is a holiday post.

I have been taught all my life to stand up to bullies. But I guess that's not how we are supposed to handle them these days. According to Bernie Sanders and the rest of the younger generation we are supposed to roll over lay on our backs and take our beating.  I get so tired of hearing protest racial inequality and income inequality. All you ever hear from the left is injustice. If elected Bernie what do you propose to do when Iraq comes to kill and destroy your Democratic Socialist country?  Talking only solves issues when both parties have a respect for one another. When one feels that he can take what he wants and get away with it negotiations are over.  One day our country will fall to Democratic Socialism at least in part. I hope I'm not around to see it but part of me would love to see the faces of the younger generation standing in food lines watching their children die while wait for medical care and looking on as their friends are imprisoned or killed because they said something against the government. Who is going to come to their rescue? Who will champion the cause of freedom? Who will raise their voice against a tyrannical government that has removed all the rights of the people?

Once upon a time there was a magical President named FDR.  FDR stood up to the banks and the creators of Hoovervilles.  He gave people hope.  He energized the Tennessee Valley.  He stood up to Nazis and almost finished them off...  He was a REAL Democrat.  FDR's attitude in the party died after 30 years; bought off by lobbyists and conmen.

Whats Really Happening  I watched 60 minutes last night and was struck by Anderson Coopers negative tone while interviewing Bernie Sanders. While there was some effort to balance the interview in its questioning and editing it seemed fairly or unfairly on my part meant to leave a negative impression. I was disappointed because 60 minutes usually presents a pretty balanced picture. But this is a lot more than just a single interview. This is a defense of the system. The economic system of the Cons. Bernie Sanders will do one thing for sure cost them money! The entire money extracting machine of the Cons economy has been going full blast with both Democratic and republican approval and participation for years. Both parties are complicit in the wealth extraction of America. It is only the progressives that have finally said enough!  From the owned and vested major networks like CBS to the lying beast of the Fox Propaganda Network and the insanity and outrage machine of the far right. And by the way no one ever calls it the far right anymore because they are all part of it. Everybody is there to protect their right to plunder the nation on behalf of the oligarchs. The absolute absurdity of so many things to the benefit of those same oligarchs is what Bernie Sanders seeks to end and what they seek to protect. A glowing positive interview may not have gone well with the bosses the minions of those oligarchs. I think after all of these years the Castro questions were the most obvious. Its really not funny how Donald Trump was treated and what they did to Bernie Sanders.  Perhaps Im paranoid but it just seems that everybody even 60 minutes is trying to give the trolls a sound bite. This is a battle to rescue the nation from the grips of the oligarchs their propaganda and wealth extraction machines. From paying at least 25% for the real death panels of the insurance companies. The restrictions of being in network co-pays and having to stay on your job to keep your insurance. For paying insurance companies for the same job a good computer system could do and to eliminate a major source of funding for the Cons and Supremacists. Yes we get screwed in every direction by the insurance companies and if you are on Medicare then you know how much better it is than the super expensive insurance! And its that way with so many things! Its not about taking away from the rich its about stopping being prey for the rich! RC Romine,political,Facebook

"Bernie Sanders ""Medicare for All"" Proposal: Damaging to the Economy?  A financial analyst recently suggested that Bernie Sanders ""Medicare for All"" proposal would cause the average tax rate on a family which earns $250000 a year to increase from 24% to 40%. The journalist who reported on this finding stated: That would obviously hurt the economy. Without consideration of the accuracy of the tax estimates let's examine the journalist's conclusions.  Essentially we are talking about a transfer of income from families which earn $250000 to families which earn significantly less than this amount. Nevermind that low wages make high wages possible and that market value earnings of $250000 do not equate to the social value of that activity; but let us move on to a consideration of the real impact of the above redistribution scheme.  Families which earn $250000 undoubtedly will save some of this income. This of course diminishes the sales of goods and services which has a negative impact on the economy. Contrariwise moderate to middle income families consume nearly all if not all of their income and and would continue spend nearly all of their income if this income were freed from the burden of health care premiums and other health care related expenses. This of course would be a boom to the economy.  The opponent of this argument will likely argue that savings however fuel investment and growth and that this is necessary for a healthy economy. This view demonstrates a complete misunderstanding of the money creation process. Commercial banks literally create new money when they make loans. As a result loans create deposits not the other way around. In the U.S. large banks must maintain a level of reserves which equal 10% of their deposits. This is considered a safe level of reserves necessary to facilitate clearing transactions between banks. Or stated differently because on any given day it is unlikely that people will withdraw or write checks which after the receipt of funds from checks written on other banks will likely exceed 10% of a bank's deposit base. If a bank runs short on reserves it borrows reserves from banks with excess reserves at an interest rate targeted by the Federal Reserve through its open market operations. This is called the federal funds rate and today the targeted rate is 2.5%. Customer savings are an alternative source of reserves. The interest rate on savings is less than the Fed Funds rate so that customer savings merely provide banks with a source of low cost reserves. Banks do not need savings in order to fund investments; they merely need an adequate level of reserves which back loans i.e. deposit expansion. The Federal Reserve can provide any level of reserves it deems appropriate for loan/deposit growth. Savings are not required to fund loan growth.  So how does the transfer of income from those who do not consume all of their earnings to those who do consume all of their earnings hurt the economy? The simple answer is: it doesn't. The expansion of consumable income among moderate and middle income people will improve economic activity not diminish it.",political,Facebook
A few days ago at a Bernie Sanders rally Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called the United States a fascist Nation. Where to begin? First of all fascism is a political agenda enforced by intimidation and violence. Secondly it is state run control of the economy. Neither of these are in harmony with the founding documents of our country. Our country is based on Liberty an individual freedom which we as Republicans are doing our best to preserve. The only ones to meet the definition of fascism according to AOC is her own Democratic Party who has Antifa a violent group as an extension of their party this is quite similar to Hitler's brown shirts. And AOC's lame Green New Deal is nothing but government takeover and enforcement of the primary engine of our economy which is oil. Her ideas are violent and dangerous and are only getting traction because of an ignorant populace.  My candidacy is aimed at pushing back against such horrid rhetoric and being a strong voice for Liberty and the Bill of Rights and carrying that message to all people. Particularly the Youth of America who has the term fascist thrown around so much that they don't even know what it means anymore. And most alarming of all is that our current cd9 Congressman Greg Stanton is silent in the face of AOC's despicable and illiterate comments which leads me to believe he either endorses it and agrees or is too afraid to stand up to this 27 year old. But Stanton has proven himself just a shill of the radical Progressive philosophy as he voted in the Judiciary Committee to pass the articles of impeachment to the house. Stanton said Trump must be removed immediately but now Nancy doesn't seem to think so. How interesting that's something that was so urgent now doesn't seem to matter to them at all.  As your Congressman I will represent all the voices in my district and I will never violate half my constituents. Impeachment is only for the most grave of circumstances and in this fake impeachment there's not even a crime.,political,Facebook
If Trump cheated to get elected & his cheat crossed over to illegal his election is illegitimate. Why do we have to accept his permanent judges? Or if Trump is dumped why the hell should we put up with Pence? There is no part of the Trump admin that we should have to put up with if he cheated & used illegal methods to do so.  There should be a class action impeachment of the entire administration. It should be as if it never happened...a massive purging.  & by rights Hillary should be put in the Presidency if shell take it...or even better; Bernie. Maybe Trump voters will like her attitude now that theyve beaten her like a dog  dragged her thru Hell & wiped that uppity elite bubble living attitude off her face? 300 years ago they would have burned her as a witch; thats the progress you get with an 8th grade education. yea!  But the bottom line is do unto others as they just did unto to you we should pay as much respect to Trump voters as they did to the Constitution & have shown to every program ever voted on meant to help in the human struggle against those who would enslave since FDR ...but also note what their intention was & still is; a racist theocracy joined in hands with Putin.  In all parts of life when you cheat & your caught...you lose...period...full stop....your disqualified & the next in line steps up. I see no difference in politics...& theres no reason we should allow them to pretend like there is.

Quite Frankly by C.W.  So if Joe Biden had not decided to throw his hat in the ring would the whole Burisma affair have even come to light? And even had it come to light would it have had enough weight to trigger an impeachment process?  Because as we all know using a foreign government to investigate our (potential) political opponents is considered interfering with our political process and an impeachable offense. (Never mind that Mr. Biden Sr is just one of over a dozen candidates. Whos to say hell even get the nomination? The bookie?)  Im kinda feelin for the Ukrainians caught in the crosshairs of American shenanigans a third of a world away from Lady Liberty and a border land between totalitarianism to the East and embryonic communism cleverly disguised as free republics to the West.  It seemed like a good idea  this getting involved with the Americans. (And they thought THEY were corrupt!)  Its been a Schi*t Show from the get go.  But still one has to wonder just what they would have come up with had there not been this incriminating phone call between presidents of state. Because just as surely as a liberal will lie and believe it these unhinged prosecutors would have had a Plan D or M or double T.  Which brings one to the next logical question: Why? What is propelling this absurdly fevered zealousness to the detriment of their own careers?  It is difficult to believe it is solely because they just cant stand Trump. While this is overwhelmingly evident it doesnt really explain what has transpired and is transpiring: A single-minded pursuit to not just topple Trump but to thoroughly discredit and if possible annihilate him on a stake in the middle of the Washington Mall.  While even the President calls them never-Trumpers that doesnt quite cover the antics of these people. Certainly despising someone can cause some unusual and out-of-character behavior but to have so many displaying the same symptoms the same fervent hysteria about remove THAT MAN from the Oval Office no matter the cost  well this is more reminiscent of a Jim Jones cult and mass suicide by fruit punch sans the religious fervor. Or actually rather eerily like it.  So the question then becomes what propels this ongoing frenetic effort to oust a duly-elected President? This three year long effort? And why WASNT there a recount following the 2016 election results?  Well quite frankly its because not one individual in the upper echelons of the DNC asylum ever thought the game would be lost. And every effort to ensure that the game would not be lost was employed. That was Plan A of which Bernie Sanders was just collateral damage. Unfortunately it also meant no inquiry could be made into recounting votes. Thus the Democrat candidate was forced to graciously concede. And be rather quick about it. (Under no circumstance can it be found more votes were cast than the number of registered voters!)  Hence Plan B. Russian collusion! Only there wasnt any. (Excepting Trump asking Putin if he found Hillarys lost emails to please let him know.)  Meanwhile the whole of the country is subjected to much wailing and gnashing of teeth brought to you courtesy of the insane-stream media. For over three years. But alas there is no collusion only a few more casualties in this war on our Republic. (A General here an agent there. In the words of a dishonorable one What difference does it make now?) Probably quite a lot to those affected.  So then what exactly is this unprecedented campaign to oust Trump? A political coup? Foreign interference in our governmental process? A vast left-wing conspiracy toward a one-world government? While there could be elements of these at play methinks the whole charade has its origins in something much more pedestrian: self-preservation.  It is truly the only explanation for the continued fabrications against our sitting president by so many. One does not get this kind of concensus without group-guilt rather like the SS officers following the fall of the reich.  Evidently the graft and corruption that has run rampant in the highest levels of our government for decades is on the precipice of exposure and all those complicit are scrambling like rats on a sinking ship. It is the only explanation that fits all the players in this sordid tragedy.  As Ben Franklin once said We must all hang together or assuredly we will all hang separately. Blessedly he helped give us a republic; cursedly theyre trying to give us a regime.  Were it not for the horseshoe nail called Biden there is a chance much of this could have been scrubbed without the whole world watching. Because quite frankly it is politically and diplomatically inexpedient to air our dirty laundry upon the world stage. But seeing as how our insane-stream media has nixed that option with their unfettered cooperation in this dismal saga it will be a half-mast day for the foreseeable future.  We Americans are a pretty resilient bunch. Well get through this hopefully wiser and more to the better. Its just a bloody shame we allowed it to come to this in the first place. Its even worse we allowed it to continue for so long.  If the last three years are any indication without Trump we would have been no better off than the Ukrainians. For that matter wed have been no better off than any of the other struggling countries in the world. (Look yea to Venezuela all thy true believers.). Actually wed be in worse shape because we wouldnt have a United States to turn to like the rest of the world does.  While that may be a rather sobering thought perhaps this is exactly what was needed to yank us out of our stupor. May we all be the better for it.,political,Facebook

IMPEACHMENT  The Senates decision not to allow witnesses was the right decision. Just as their decision to acquit will be the right decision. Both decisions are not only consistent with the rule of law they are both consistent with sound public policy. Heres why.  1. The abuse of power claim is not supported by the Constitution. Even if everything that John Bolton has alleged in his book is true it is legally irrelevant. Even if Trump told Bolton I want you to withhold aid to Ukraine unless they announce an investigation into Biden this would not make what Trump did an impeachable offense under the Constitution. It would NOT constitute a High Crime or Misdemeanor. Hence there is no reason to call Bolton as a witness. There are many other arguments why Bolton should not be called by the Senate like it was the responsibility of the House to get a court order compelling his testimony before the House but the dispositive reason is that his testimony is legally irrelevant in that even if allowed and believed it would not change the outcome as a matter of law.  2. The obstruction of Congress claim is fatally flawed as a matter of law. The use of the impeachment mechanism for the Executives failure to honor congressional subpoenas is a clear circumvention of the judiciary which is the express constitutional mechanism for resolving such disputes. It is a blatant and unconstitutional power grab by a Democrat controlled House. The idea that the House or the Senate gets to demand anything from the Executive and then impeach the Executive for failing to comply with their demands while circumventing judicial review would make Congress judge jury and executioner. Its absurd and unconstitutional on its face. Yet this is precisely what the House is doing - with the media cheering them on. Its really incredibly pathetic and dangerous. More insidious and more dangerous to our democracy than anything Trump is accused of doing because these are not the acts of one man. These are the unconstitutional acts of an entire political party - the Democrat Party. It is also a blatant attempt to misuse the taxpayer funded impeachment process to influence the 2020 election. Just as casting dispersions on the Senates refusal to call unnecessary or irrelevant witnesses is a blatant attempt to influence the 2020 election. Just as claiming that a free and fair election in 2020 is somehow no longer possible is a clear and blatant attempt to influence the 2020 election. All of these false claims weaken and irresponsibly undermine our democracy. These claims represent far more egregious and hideous attempts to influence the 2020 election than an inappropriate (but not illegal) phone call that resulted in absolutely no influence on the 2020 election.  Like Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz I have a deep reverence for the law. Ive been a lawyer for more than half of my life. Ive practiced law at the highest levels both serving as Nevadas Attorney General and successfully arguing before the U.S. Supreme Court. I love and respect the rule of law and the Constitution. And I stand today for the rule of law. Just as the U.S. Senate the worlds greatest deliberative body has and will. This is not a stance in support of Donald Trump. I would be taking the exact same legal position if it was Bernie Sanders who was being impeached.  Some people are so focused on removing Trump from office that they will ignore the rule of law. Some have no idea what the law requires. Some believe that removing Trump is so essential that the ends justify the means regardless of what the law requires. Some will selectively pull from the historical comments of founders like Hamilton to support their analysis - while ignoring the actual text of the Constitution and the full scope of the founders debates that lead to the use of the term High Crimes and Misdemeanors. Hamilton was one voice among many. His views did not carry the day. The combined wisdom of the founders did and they required more for impeachment than Hamilton did.  Those who support a broad reading of the Impeachment language are playing the short game. Theyre not thinking about the future. Theyre not thinking about how the decisions we make today will affect our society tomorrow and possibly for the next 240 years. The rules that we embrace today can easily come back to haunt us tomorrow. Today this expansive reading of the Constitution may serve the anti-Trump crowd - but tomorrow it could be used to remove Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren for whatever the House or the Senate believes is an abuse of Congress. Do we really want to give Congress that kind of undefined power? What if its a Republican controlled House or Senate and a Democrat in the White House? This is precisely why we have three co-equal branches of government. We need them to remain co-equal to maintain a system of checks and balances. We dont want any single branch to dominate. Each branch is there to keep the other branches in check - using the mechanisms proscribed by the Constitution. Here the House has sought to circumvent the Judiciary by moving directly for impeachment. And if that werent enough theyve gone beyond that unconstitutional power grab by attempting to undermine and destroy public confidence in the Senate and the entire electoral process. These actions should not be ignored or rewarded. They should be called out and condemned.  The majority of the public doesnt understand the law. Theyre just sick and tired of the Impeachment charade. More sick and tired of it than they are of Trump. Gallup's Jan. 2-15 survey shows 46% in favor of conviction and 51% against.  People know the call was wrong (contrary to Trumps assertion it was not perfect - not even close) and they also know that it doesnt rise to the level of an impeachable offense under the Constitution.  Dershowitz voted for Hillary Clinton. He is not a Trump supporter. He is one of the few liberal legal scholars who has had the courage to hold his reverence for the law above partisan biases. Although he has been wrongfully maligned demeaned and misquoted by the liberal press hes right about the law. The call is not an impeachable offense (not even close.) And the same is true of the obstruction of Congress claim.  The public knows this instinctively. They may not know the law but they know that a phone call of this kind which yielded nothing does not warrant impeachment. And they resent the Democrats misusing the impeachment mechanism which should be extremely rare for something that doesnt come close to meeting the constitutional standard of a High Crime or Misdemeanor.  They also resent the obvious power grab by the House to resort to impeachment rather than the courts when their subpoenas are thwarted by the Executive. The Executive Branch and the Congress are co-equal branches of government. Neither has the power to force the other to do anything without the blessing of the third co-equal branch of government - the Judiciary. Congress has the right to subpoena information from the Executive and the Executive has the right to object or raise Executive Privilege. This has been happening for 240 years and these disputes have been resolved for 240 years by compromise or by the judiciary. This is what the Constitution requires. Here the Democrats in the House have attempted to bypass the Judiciary and move for impeachment. This is not an act that is in furtherance of the Constitution. This is a dangerous and unconstitutional act.  We have three branches of government. The Judicial Branch was specifically created to resolve all disputes between Congress and the Executive.  What you are hearing from Democrats today on the floor of the Senate and on CNN and MSNBC is the ultimate example of a very dark black pot calling the kettle black. A gang of liars calling a liar out.  The public sees all of this. They see the media joining in the anti-Trump campaign as they did in 2016. They see the medias widespread lack of honesty and objectivity. And they resent it. They resent being lied to. They resent being misled by a partisan cabal of social liberals who think the ends justify the means. The ends dont justify the means. They rarely if ever do.  Im not a tribalist. Im not a Republican or a Democrat. I reject both parties and both labels. Im a social liberal who believes as Abraham Lincoln did that you dont help employees by undermining their employers. Im pro-choice and pro-LGBTQ. I support protecting our environment. I support criminal justice reform. I support universal background checks for gun ownership. And I support legal immigration. Most importantly I support the rule of law. Absent the rule of law we have no civilized society.  When you get down in the mud to wrestle with a mud slinging politician you become nothing more than another mud slinging politician. And throwing more mud doesnt make you better cleaner or less objectionable. If anything it makes you worse. Rather than raise the game rather than lead rather than follow the rule of law youre short term mentality and your erroneous belief that the ends justify the means acts as the final nail in the coffin that ensures not only your oppositions demise but your own.  40% of Millennials are already politically unaffiliated. They are the ones who are leading. And they are doing so by rejecting both Republicans and Democrats - as they should.  Both of Americas major political parties are functionally dishonest corrupt and dysfunctional. Not all politicians are dishonest corrupt or dysfunctional most are decent human beings who would like to do the right thing but the system that they all operate in is unequivocally all of the above.  To suggest that Democrats are a suitable replacement for Trump is like suggesting that you replace a liar with a gang of liars.  Democrats are telling the American public get rid of this horrid despicable liar. And the publics response in 2020 will be for what a lying cabal?  In sum when a group of habitual liars point the finger at another habitual liar and yell hes lying the response is not outrage towards the target of the accusations. Its outrage toward the dishonest inauthentic and self interested accusers.  This is especially true when the accused is actually delivering on his campaign promises the same promises that got him elected and he is continuously denied all due process and any semblance of objectivity by his accusers.  If you want to get rid of a liar. Try telling the truth. The whole truth. And nothing but the truth. Thats how you get rid of a liar. By setting yourself apart. By being better more honest more objective and more dependable. By fighting fire with water (truth) - not more fire (more lies).,political,Facebook

"SOCIALISM OR DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM?  Note that I clipped excerpts from a lot of free thinkers for this post.  Historically socialismdefined as government control over all or most of the economyhas led to mass murder poverty and oppression on an enormous scale. The experience of communist nations around the world is instructive. To avoid terminological confusion it is worth noting that the communists saw themselves (correctly) as implementing socialism; ""communism"" was on the Marxist-Leninist view a later stage of social evolution none of these regimes ever actually claimed to have attained. The current horrible oppression in Venezuela (perpetrated by a socialist regime that generally does not claim to be communist) which has led to perhaps the biggest refugee crisis in the history of the Western hemisphere is just the latest iteration of the same pattern.  Second we are assured that latter-day socialists or democratic socialists don't actually mean to impose government control over the means of production. They just want greatly increased regulation and welfare state spending. Often their agenda is analogized to the policies of Scandinavian nations which have large welfare states but remain relatively prosperous and free.  Unfortunately these distinctions are not as reassuring as they might seem. The expansion of government power advocated by modern socialists is so great that it would put most of the economy under state control even if much industry formally remained under private ownership. It goes far beyond any Scandinavian precedent. And it is unlikely that democracy can effectively constrain the abuses of such a leviathan state. It is also questionable that a government like that could remain democratic in the long run.  The standard agenda favored by most democratic socialists  single-payer health care universal free college and a guaranteed federal job for anyone who wants onewould cost some $42.5 trillion over a ten year period ($4.25 trillion per year). This would nearly double current federal spending levels which are projected to total just under $4.75 trillion in fiscal year 2020. Federal government spending would rise from its current level of about 20% of GDP to 35-40% or more (depending on future economic growth and levels of spending on other programs which is also projected to rise).  The socialist agenda is not limited to increased spending. They also advocate massive increases in federal regulation. Examples include a $15 minimum wage greatly increased regulation of labor and corporate boards expanded environmental regulation expanded regulation of media and the internet increased protectionism to keep out foreign goods and so on. The combination of the $15 minimum wage (which even many liberal economists believe is likely to significantly reduce private sector employment) and guaranteed federal jobs would ensure that a large proportion of the work force would over time come to consist of direct employees of the federal government.  The democratic socialist agenda goes well beyond the Nordic nations advocates sometimes cite as models. While these countries have comparatively large welfare states they combine them with low levels of regulation and high openness to international trade. To take just one example none of the Nordic nations have a national government-mandated minimum wage.  The Nordic nations actually come close to the United States (and occasionally even outscore it) on standard measures of economic liberty. Iceland (slightly ahead of the US) and Denmark (slightly behind) were statistically indistinguishable from the US in the latest Index of Economic Freedom ranking put out by the conservative Heritage Foundation. Finland and Sweden were only slightly lower. When Danish Prime Minister Lars Lkke Rasmussen tried to explain to Bernie Sanders that his country is not actually socialist the latter should have listened. Indeed what US democratic socialists advocate goes beyond the current level of government control of the economy in any Western European nation.  The danger of future demagogues aside it is far from clear that even our current crop of democratic socialist leaders is immune to illiberal temptations. Bernie Sanders our most prominent socialist politician has a long history of supporting authoritarian socialist regimes abroad. He and others might not be averse to using the same sorts of tactics at home if the opportunity arose.  Finally it is unlikely that a democratic socialist state will actually remain democratic in the long run. If the government controls the vast bulk of the economy it can over time use its control over key resources to reward its supporters and suppress opponents. This has in fact actually happened in Venezuela where the government has used such tools as its control over food resources to incentivize support for the regime and forestall opposition.",political,Facebook

The Myth That Ate America  This is the story that most Americans dont want to hear. Because they are in love with the myth. I will be attacked and declared an idiot but I must tell this story. You see the majority are the ones that have really killed what America could be. They fell in love with a myth. That we were the wealthiest nation in the world. In fact in a way that is true but not in the way you may think. We have the wealthiest Billionaires and their henchmen and women. But the nation is bankrupt and we the majority are so broke a couple of weeks off and we are desperate. There is money for new phones a nice place to live and maybe a fancy car but not enough to save. I would bet that I have more money in the bank than a lot of people with fancy cars and homes. And I dont have much.  We fell for their myth which most understood to be a lie but wanted it so badly that they couldnt accept that it was a lie. They jumped on that bandwagon understanding they were simply eating the wealth of the nation and of other Americans. But they didnt care. If people were destroyed by their Success of raping the nation then so be it. After all they had the house in the right neighborhood the car that shouted their Success every time they drove by and the status of their gated community and the perks they could buy. They were the American dream even if it killed our democracy and nation. This is the siren song of the Cons and Centrists. They just want it to last long enough to outlive then then they can blame us in heaven or so they think.  The ever driving business cycle that they had become addicted to shows itself for what is caused by the stress of the Corvid-19 virus. Everything fed on itself fed into something else and was driven by raping the wealth of Americans and the nation. Fox News and CNBC told the world that the nations wealth was there for the taking. And they did they took it and they used the money to hide what was actually happening. They hid what was happening at the bottom and middle of the economy the nation. They used the money made in the stock market to fund Chinas infrastructure and to ship your job over there. But it was all good that was just the Free Market at work. Then they bought the media and we heard only what they wanted us to hear. Bought both political parties and made sure they decided who won. The Cons destroyed water quality and polluted the Earth to increase profits. And they reveled in the death of the soul of our nation the death of the Founders dreams. Truth logic and ethics were at odds with the myth and they made sure they were not heard. Again in Bernie Sanders the honorable and honest have been defeated by their ownership of the process. Their myth of a free lunch eating the wealth of America is killing our nation. But those so in love with it dont care. They care that it lasts until they dont. Then they dont care.

My name is Bernie Buff and I am running for a position on the Schuylerville School Board. The amazing sense of community caring and compassionate teachers and educational opportunities that my daughters have experienced created my desire to serve on the School Board. My career has afforded me the opportunity to develop many skills including: scheduling contract management large scale budgeting consensus building and conflict resolution. I believe this knowledge along with a fresh outlook would be an asset during the decision making process that is required of members.  I was born and raised in East Nassau NY and attended New Lebanon High School in Columbia County. I have a Bachelors degree in Landscape Architecture from SUNY Environmental Science and Forestry in Syracuse NY. I have worked in the wireless telecommunications construction industry for the last 25 years as a project manager and currently work for Verizon Wireless. My wife Cathleen a public school teacher and I were impressed by SCS and chose to settle on Southard Road in 2009. Our two daughters Maeve 9th and Anika 7th have attended Schuylerville since Kindergarten.  During my time in the district I have attended many school field trips as a chaperone volunteered for my daughters' Girl Scout activities and assisted with PEP events and fundraisers during my wife's tenure on the executive board. My family and I have also opened our home to several coaches from Challenger Sports British Soccer Camp offered by OSAA.  As a Board member I believe I would bring an open-minded honest and fair approach to the stake-holders and members of the Schuylerville district and community.

The so-called No Bail Reform Law which went into effect on January 1st has already proven to be a disaster. Individuals charged with punching police officers and assaulting Orthodox Jewish women have been allowed right back on the street. In one particular case a defendant charged with bank robbery and who had a history of felony arrests and parole violations was immediately released and robbed two banks.  Not only does this bill put dangerous defendants back on the street to endanger innocent people it creates a climate of lawlessness and disrespect for the law which encourages more crime.  This law which was passed by Democratic Senators and Assembly Members and signed by Governor Cuomo must be corrected as soon as possible. Even though it now appears some Albany Democrats are getting the message and are willing to make at least some changes others are pushing back and resisting any changes or modifications.  As an activist at an Albany rally against any change or correction said: And now a couple of white dudes with MAGA hats criticize the reforms and you want to backtrack?(!)

"For all my colored friends on the doubt you hold against Bernie--these are some of the facts of Bernie's fight for equal rights:  Sanders was born and raised in the Brooklyn borough of New York City and attended Brooklyn College before graduating from the University of Chicago in 1964. While a student he was an active protest organizer for the Congress of Racial Equality and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee during the civil rights movement. After settling in Vermont in 1968 Sanders ran unsuccessful third-party political campaigns in the early to mid-1970s. As an independent he was elected mayor of Burlingtonthe state's most populous cityin 1981 by a margin of ten votes. He was reelected three times. He won election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1990 representing Vermont's at-large congressional district; he later co-founded the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Sanders served as a U.S. Representative for 16 years before being elected to the U.S. Senate in 2006. He has been reelected to the Senate twice: in 2012 and 2018. On April 30 2015 Sanders announced his campaign for the 2016 Democratic nomination for President of the United States. Initially considered a long shot he went on to win 23 primaries and caucuses and approximately 43% of pledged delegates to Hillary Clinton's 55%. His campaign was noted for its supporters' enthusiasm as well as for his rejection of large donations from corporations the financial industry and any associated Super PAC. On July 12 2016 he formally endorsed Clinton in her general election campaign against Republican Donald Trump while urging his supporters to continue the ""political revolution"" his campaign began. On February 19 2019 Sanders announced a second presidential campaign against incumbent President Trump joining multiple other Democratic candidates for the presidency. A self-described democratic socialist and progressive Sanders supports labor rights and emphasizes reversing economic inequality. He advocates for universal and single-payer healthcare paid parental leave as well as tuition-free tertiary education. On foreign policy Sanders broadly supports reducing military spending pursuing more diplomacy and international cooperation and putting greater emphasis on labor rights and environmental concerns when negotiating international trade agreements. Sanders would later describe his time in Chicago as ""the major period of intellectual ferment in my life"".[30] While at the University of Chicago Sanders joined the Young People's Socialist League (the youth affiliate of the Socialist Party of America) and was active in the Civil Rights Movement as a student for the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee Under Sanders's chairmanship the university chapter of CORE merged with the university chapter of SNCC. In January 1962 Sanders went to a rally at the University of Chicago administration building to protest university president George Wells Beadle's segregated campus housing policy. ""We feel it is an intolerable situation when Negro and white students of the university cannot live together in university-owned apartments"" Sanders said at the protest. Sanders and 32 other students then entered the building and camped outside the president's office. After weeks of sit-ins Beadle and the university formed a commission to investigate discrimination. Following further protests in the summer of 1963 the University of Chicago ended official racial segregation in private university housing. Joan Mahoney a member of the University of Chicago CORE chapter at the time and a fellow participant in the sit-ins described Sanders in a 2016 interview as ""... a swell guy a nice Jewish boy from Brooklyn but he wasn't terribly charismatic. One of his strengths though was his ability to work with a wide group of people even those he didn't agree with"". Sanders once spent a day putting up fliers protesting against police brutality only to eventually notice that a Chicago police car was shadowing him and taking them all down. Sanders attended the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom where Martin Luther King Jr. gave his ""I Have a Dream"" speech. That summer he was fined $25 (equivalent to $205 in 2018) for resisting arrest during a demonstration in Englewood against segregation in Chicago's public schools.",political,Facebook
"Dear Trump's Base  A serious enquiry... for the sake of avoiding pointless back and forth arguments let's remove from this discussion the uncertainties of all elections and their possible outcomes so we can focus on the one absolute certainty we do have about one election in particular; 2024  No matter what happens between now and then... the Trump Presidency ends at the absolute latest in November 2024. It may not survive that long but if all things are possible the exception that proves the rule is the one thing that will not be possible; Trump's Presidency continuing past at most a second term. If it survives everything else that currently threatens it and Trump does win a second term the age of Trump still ends in November 2024. No amount of spin can deny that absolute fact.  So what are you planning on doing when Trump is gone....?  If a Democrat wins the Presidency you will likely see all of Trump's work being reversed and erased just as you have watched Trump reversing and erasing everything Obama did.  And if a Republican wins... it will be through a bitter fought Republican Primary with Trump's ""base"" being ripped apart by Republicans themselves trying to get your vote in the primaries. You saw what the Hillary/Bernie battle did to the Dems... when Trump is not on the ticket where does your loyalty go? Can you trust a politician who says he will defend Trump's legacy? Maybe but guess what all the Republican Primary Candidates will say something similar just to get your vote... and if they are all saying it you will fracture and the ""base"" will be lost in a DC swamp.  2024 will be the end of the Trump party. And those of you that identify yourself as Trump's base will be targeted by every other Republican and you will also face outside interference designed to deliberately turn you against each other. And you will... because Trump has taught you not to trust or believe anyone but him. And when he's gone... who are you going to trust? Do you just tuck tails and walk away sit back and watch Trump's policies erased and find yourselves even more ""forgotten"" and ""left behind"" than you felt before Trump seduced you into becoming his base? Will you become Rubio's base... or Cruz's base... or any one of those politicians that you know don't really like Trump no matter what they say on Fox news. You know they lie. Ryan Cruz McConnel Rubio they will all lie and try to con you. But you saw them in 2016 you can't trust a single one of them.  Trump has isolated himself from DC instead of building a base of genuine support and allies he has decided to go it alone.  But he has forgotten that a king needs an heir if History is to remember him kindly.  Trump will be gone in 2024 and if you keep following Trump blindly supporting everything he does at the expense of everything else you need. You will be facing a nation that will close the door on you forever because you already slammed the door shut on everybody else.  So are you going to follow Trump into oblivion? Or face the certainty of the Trumpless Future and adapt to it by opening that door you slammed in the face of every democrat immigrant muslim jew black person etc and find a way for yourself to make it work as an American Citizen with an increasingly diverse population alongside you. Or will you dig yourself deeper into a Trump trench and then find you have put yourselves in that lonely trench that will get darker and darker. And Trump won't be there to shine a light he'll be living the New York high life of a rich urban elitist lording it over the little people from his Tower just as he always did before he made you believe he was something else.  So I pose a serious question to all you lovers of Trump. What are you going to do when the Trump party ends?  Do you choose to embrace the rest of America and accept that like it or not we all have to work together in order to truly make America great? Or throw it all away and become used as nothing more than the meat thrown into the DC shark pool to feed the Republicans with your fractured votes?",political,Facebook
After reading this I hope everyone will realize that being indifferent about our local government is not an option. The costs are mounting and our community is paying the price. Here is the latest debacle Multiple fire districts in Dona Ana County were downgraded communities hardest hit were: Talavera Las Alturas Anthony La Mesa La Union Mesquite and Radium Springs. Nationally fewer than 3% of fire districts receive the lowest grade but in Doa Ana County 37.5% did. In New Mexico 17 fire districts have the lowest grade; nearly a third are in Doa Ana County. What is even more alarming is that county officials were notified of the failing grades and given a year to improve. However in an extreme display of incompetence the county did nothing to fix the problems. If you live in one of these areas your fire protection is not just bad it is the worst available. Fire district grades are used by insurance companies to determine risk and as risk goes up so does the cost of insurance. The result is skyrocketing insurance premiums and in some cases coverage being dropped altogether. In addition to the costs residents should have an even greater concern Safety! Are we adequately protected if your house catches fire or if you need an ambulance? Rating agencies and insurance companies have determined you are not. Fire ratings went into effect in March 2018 and will remain in effect for two years. Insurance companies are now adjusting their rates accordingly and here are a few of the stories of the impact as reported by the Sun News: Chip Carlson an insurance agent for Pat Campbell Insurance in Las Cruces first learned that the fire districts were being downgraded when he contacted one of the companies he represents to obtain a quote for a customer and the premium was through the roof. Insurance companies adjust their premiums when a policy is renewed typically once a year so many property owners in the failing districts have not yet learned whether their premiums will increase. Shockwaves are rippling through the county one policyholder at a time as they receive their new policies in the mail or are contacted by their agents. Carlson insures about 4000 homeowners throughout Doa Ana County. He said he has one client in Talavera whose annual premium skyrocketed from $1400 to $3900 an increase of 179%. Another customer in La Mesa whose house is in the Mesquite fire district saw their premium double from $675 to $1353.I couldnt believe this was happening Carlson said. I care very much about my customers. Rodriguez another DAC resident was notified in May by his mortgage company Quicken Loans that his insurance company Farmers Insurance was increasing his premium from $849 to $1600 per year a jump of 88%. He and his daughter immediately began shopping around for a better rate and found one from State Farm which doesnt use ISO grades in establishing premiums. He cancelled his policy with Farmers in July only to discover shortly after State Farm inspected his house that they wouldnt insure him unless he replaced the roof. He couldnt afford to hire a roofer which he said would have cost him $7000 to $8000 so he and the boyfriend of his youngest daughter are replacing the roof themselves. In the meantime his home is uninsured. I have to do something he said. What has happened to Rodriguez is happening to property owners all over the county. Its happening to a commercial landlord in Anthony. Its happening to homeowner in Las Alturas. Its happening to a retired couple in La Mesa. Bernie Ryan a retired lawyer owns a 2600 -square-foot home in Las Alturas. His insurance premium is increasing from $950 to $1500 a year. But he feels lucky compared to one of his neighbors whose premium nearly tripled from $1800 to $5000. Virginia and Howard Ness both retired from the National Park Service own a 114-year-old house in La Mesa that is on the National Register of Historic Places. They received an e-mail from Carlson recently telling them that their premium would likely double. Already their sons premium has doubled. There's other things I'd like to do with my money like visit my grandchildren Virginia Ness said. Maybe its my fault  you vote for people and you think youre being taken care of. The county is letting us down. A secondary impact of the rising insurance premiums is that many insurance companies wont write new policies in the failing districts. That makes it difficult for people who want to buy homes in those areas to get insurance which has already caused real estate deals to fall through. Carlson said he has a policy holder in Las Cruces who wanted to buy a $300000 home in Las Alturas. The sale was scheduled to close in March but then he discovered that the premium on the house would be increasing from $1400 to $3000 a year. Soon after Travelers Insurance informed Carlson that it wouldnt insure the house. His client decided not to purchase the house after all. Nevarez who represents Farmers Insurance said he has lost seven or eight customers because the company wouldnt insure them since their homes were located in county fire districts that received the lowest possible grade. They even turned down a homeowner whose house is within 100 yards of the Las Alturas fire station. It is my view that the most important role of government is public safety and security. We live in a high tax county in a high tax state and due to poor leadership (politicians who dont show up waste fraud and abuse). We the people are now being forced to pay even higher insurance premiums on top of the insane taxes we already pay. The incompetence of our government is hurting our economy. Whether its buying a home remodel or new construction business will slow in these areas thanks to our elected officials. Democrats Libertarians Republicans Womens groups etc. are all getting behind my campaign because they see issues like these and want a leader with common sense who is willing to work hard to get our county moving in the right direction. Many of my supporters continuously say PERSON OVER PARTY is the only way to get DAC back on track. Make sure to like and follow my campaign page to get updates on important issues facing our county.

More Common Sense on Gun Control - Charlie's Soapbox 8/9/19  Some of the Democrat presidential candidates wasted no time in blaming the mass shooting at the Walmart in El Paso on President Trump.  That is both dumb and stupid and tantamount to blaming all the police shootings on Barack Obama for his careless remarks about the police acting stupidly or blaming Bernie Sanders for the attempted murder of then Majority Whip Steve Scalise and other Republican lawmakers at a softball game practice because the perpetrator was one of his supporters or blaming the Dayton shooter because he was a supporter of Elizabeth Warren.  No this is simply political desperation by also-rans trying to get a little more face time on TV to bolster their faltering campaigns.  This attitude this approach and these kinds of opportunistic politicians are the very reason there has been no movement on gun legislation because law-abiding gun owners know that this kind of attitude that immediately grabs the low hanging fruit and never the roots of a problem skews to overkill that in reality does nothing about the real dilemma and ends up being a futile exhibition of asinine hyperbole and rhetoric about how the opposing side wants to see mass murders and school shootings.  Nobody with enough gray matter to tie their shoes really believes that the proponents of the second amendment want to see gun violence and that kind of gross incendiary dialogue is totally counterproductive to doing anything about sensible gun laws or the insanity on our streets.  Actually the first thing to do and what would make a world of difference would be to enforce existing gun laws the cities with the most stringent firearm laws have the highest murder rates.  Unscrupulous gun dealers and black-market gun dealers need to be taken off the streets and face serious jail time.  Secondly the very geniuses who want to blame Trump for El Paso advocate a policy that actually imports violent gang members and other criminals across our southern borders every day look at the statistics dealing with MS-13 and how many violent crimes have been committed by people who crossed into this country illegally.  The problem with getting legal gun owners on board is the governments habit of throwing the baby out with the bathwater and their give us an inch and well take a mile approach.  Actually the master plan on the radical side is an incremental outlawing of all privately-owned firearms second amendment be damned.  They oppose placing well-trained security personnel at schools probably because President Trump supports it.  There are enough qualified military veterans and off duty police officers to set and execute the kind of security it would take to make our schools much safer.  The difference in the murder rate in El Paso and the one in Dayton was due to the presence of police officers in Dayton who were on the scene in 30 seconds and brought the killer down before he could carry out the number of killings he undoubtedly planned to do.  Even if the anti-gun contingent had their ultimate way and were successful in removing legally owned guns in America nothing would be done about the illegally owned ones. One more law is not going to turn criminals into law-abiding citizens.  And even if they were successful in getting most of the illegal guns off the streets there would be a thriving black market the cartels in Mexico are very diverse and if theres big money involved they will find a way.  So where does that leave us?  Actually right back at square one where we started with the apparent need to deal with the facts not the fiction.  Lets expose the myths perpetrated by the anti-gun lobby.  First of all background checks.  In my home state of Tennessee we have a thorough background check system and not just the first time you purchase a firearm but every time.  Every state Ive bought a gun in have these same kinds of requirements especially for buying handguns and yes even at the gun shows youve heard so much about.  We cant have meaningful politically correct gun legislation police have to be given the latitude they need to clean up the violence in the streets and have to be backed by city hall state capitals and the federal government.  A mayor who cant even vigorously condemn throwing water on policemen carrying out their duty or has a let them destroy attitude or turns a blind eye to the crime in their cities for some ill-perceived political expediency are not servants of the people but self-serving political hacks part of the problem not the solution  The roots of our gun problem run through the political process the biased media the dealers who allow straw purchasing of firearms the alley dealers and the crime communitys black market.  One place it does not run is through the locked gun cabinets of the millions and millions of legal gun owners who have never used their guns for anything except sports and protection.  They have a right to own guns criminals dont apply the medicine to the diseased areas not the healthy ones.  What do you think?  Pray for the peace of Jerusalem.

This is Us Against the Authoritarians its Just that Simple  In my last and prior post I mentioned just some of the groups and nations trying to control us. The one thing they have in common is they are authoritarians. From the homegrown those I call the SocioCons (Sociopath + Conservative Authoritarians) and the Supremacists (Oil Corporate White and Religious) their paid shills and Republican politicians to foreign nations like Russia and Saudi Arabia and perhaps even Israel. What they all have in common is that they are strongly authoritarian and yes the same can be argued about Israel. And they all want Trump the destroyer to remain in office to weaken this nation. When you look at the groups both foreign and domestic it becomes clear who and what is at work here. Working as hard as they can to destroy democracy. Because a well-run and democratic America is not in their best interest!  Ask yourself what do diverse groups such as The Club for Growth The Council for National Policy radical evangelicals white supremacists the Koch Network the Alt-Right The Russians the Saudis and the investor class all have in common? They all fear a working American democracy doing the right thing! Thats what authoritarians are and what they do! And that is the game they play.  It is time to realign ourselves. The current two party system is owned and the process controlled by money. The SocioCons and Corporate Democrats have used every ploy every tactic to diminish Bernie Sanders and divide us against Elizabeth Warren. We have to focus on not just the presidency but also the rest of government. We need all Progressives to make it work! It is time to use the abilities of all Progressives warts and all and in doing so we can defeat the authoritarians. This is not the end of things by any means it is just the beginning. But perhaps it is the end of the beginning for we are now more and more understanding whats happening. The entire media machine will try to discourage us. They will ghost Bernie Sanders and they will try to split us at every junction. If you shut out the noise and look to yourself as to what is right kind of like a type of meditation it all becomes clear. That the danger is in the noise because the noise is from the authoritarians. They seek to overwhelm the truth and to shout their lies. But if you quiet your mind look beyond the noise you may just well see the stars. You may well see what we as human beings can be. As opposed to the noise that will always look to sell you what they want. RC Romine,political,Facebook
Once Upon a Time in America - Charlie's Soapbox 2/15/19  All it takes is a look at the U.S. Congress to see how seriously fractured our nation is.  Bernie Sanders no longer has the dubious pleasure of being the only openly socialist member as he has been joined by most notably and loudly - thanks to the media - Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who has kicked socialism up several notches to resemble what took Venezuela down the drain in a few short years.  The acceptance of socialism mostly by the younger voters can be blamed to a big degree on their education especially at the college level where pseudo revolutionists from the flower child generation teach the nobility of socialism making it sound like a place of social nirvana where everybody shares and shares alike where people are rewarded according to not their production but simply by virtue of being born.  Shortly after the fall of the iron curtain when American businesses rushed into the Eastern Bloc countries to reap the benefits of the fledgling democracies that McDonalds had set up shop in and the people scrambled to get the jobs they offered at better wages than they had ever seen.  Then the problems began because the workers they hired came in worked a short while and tried to spend the rest of the day just sitting around reading the newspaper or whatever work be damned.  The truth of the matter is that they simply didnt know any better the work ethic had been so thoroughly burned out of them by the socialistic theory that no matter how hard you work youll never advance and you wont make any more money so going to work to them meant sluffing off all day.  Reportedly there was also a high rate of employee turnover.  The apologists leave out the parts about how for socialism to exist there eventually has to be a totalitarian government to enforce it after the few who dare to excel start looking at the slugs and wondering why they deserve the same pay and benefits as one who brings something to the job and actually produces for their pay.  These people have to be kept quiet lest they upset the apple cart and start a movement that could turn political and topple the elite who sit at the top of the pyramid and live like royalty.  To start with a little harassment and public scorn is enough but after a while it eventually takes a midnight knock on the door and a person never being heard from again and a little bit of this goes a long way in toning down the dissenters.  When governments start nationalizing private businesses the bureaucracies explode and since they have to justify their existence they begin levying regulations that tie the hands of commerce and make it next to impossible to show a profit.  Which doesnt bother government at all since they have a never-ending source of income and when they need more money they simply raise taxes or print it.  Eventually both their sources are pushed to the bursting point when taxes cant possibly be raised anymore and as a result of printing money hyperinflation sets in and it takes a dump truck full of cash to buy the weeks groceries and no nation is willing to lend more money and the panic begins.  There is no food on the shelves gasoline is totally unaffordable even if you can find it then factories and manufacturing shuts down the government is stone broke the dole is discontinued the power struggles begin which means that even the meager amount of currency that can be had goes for guns not butter and the people resort to whatever they have to to eat - up to and including slaughtering the animals at the zoo.  Everywhere socialism has been tried it has miserably failed reducing the quality of life destroying governments and leaving economies in shreds.  Yet there is always a new gaggle of fools who think they can make it work or at least thats what they tell the electorate always masking their real intentions of having suffocating and perpetual power over a nation.  America sets on the edge of the precipice the next couple of elections will decide whether we pull back or go over the side.  What do you think?

DEBATE 2 Elizabeth and Bernie Shine  The audience loved Warren and Sanders tonight because they were extremely energetic sharp and showed Democrats how to fight. Their performance should allay the fear some have about them being too old. They will get bumps in polling in the coming days. Warren probably had the best line in response to the hapless John Delaney when she said who goes through all the trouble of running for President to say what we cant do and shouldnt fight for?. Awesome! Bernie also delivered some great lines like when Tim Ryan said Bernie didnt know what the Medicare for All bill would contain and Bernie quipped I Do know I wrote the damn bill. Watch Establishment Dems try to turn that into a critique that Bernie is too intemperate. No... people are dying for a fighter. That's why Bernie and Elizabeth are doing so well. Talk about ORourke being the second coming of Obama should finally be laid to rest now and hopefully he will drop out and run for Senate in Texas. Delaneys audacious effort to take the Labor champion crown from Bernie fell flat. Labors hard fought healthcare gains are not a sign that we love private insurance. What we would really LOVE is for healthcare to be a right instead of a management weapon deployed against us every time contracts get negotiated. Free up labor from its perennial healthcare fights and unions will spend their efforts getting better wages and working conditions.  Thats a wrap. Biden better be good tomorrow,political,Facebook
America the Thriving - Charlie's Soapbox 8/30/19  We are just finishing up a month-long run across America East coast to West coast and back and contrary to the dire warnings of democratic politicians and their lap puppy sycophants in the media who claim we are on the brink of a recession conversely what I saw was America at work busy retail outlets highways full of eighteen-wheelers and railroads with frequent long loaded freight trains moving raw materials and transporting finished goods to markets where demand is high.  No I make no claim to being an economist or to having any insight into the dealings of Americas corporations and future fiscal insanities of government but I know what I saw first-hand and since two and two is still four water still does not run uphill and if theres smoke theres a fire somewhere (cowboy logic) it appears to me that things are popping in the hinterlands.  We stopped in Midland Texas to let our driver rest and despite the 112 weather the entire region resembled a beehive oil wells pumping new ones being drilled new buildings going up all over the city the suburbs and outlying areas and improvised campgrounds everywhere where thousands of new workers without permanent housing park their campers and trailers.  And speaking of housing there are more housing developments and single home and apartment construction projects going on than you can count.  Hazel and myself had a great chicken fried steak with all the trimmings at a blue-collar Texas eating establishment and during the course of our meal this guy that was about 6 5 and at least an ax handle across the shoulders came and sat down at a table across from us.  I said to my wife Hazel I would like to see Bernie Sanders come out here and explain to him why he wants to close all of this down.  The claims that a recession looms is - at least in my humble opinion - for the most part politically motivated. The Democrats have tried every trick in the book to get rid of Donald Trump and have miserably failed and brought to light serious infractions of the law and in the process poised several sharp axes above quite a few heads on their own side of the aisle the ramifications of which still remain to be seen.  And since that didnt work they with the help of their personal public relations arm - the mainstream media - are trying to scare off Trump voters by insinuating that they would be voting themselves into a recession and some like Bill Maher are actively hoping for a recession saying that even if it hurts people it will be worth it to get rid of Trump.  With regards to a vote for Trump is a vote for recession - again only my humble opinion - the opposite would be true.  Can you imagine what would happen to the stock market if someone is elected who has vowed to do away with the use of fossil fuel provide free college health care for all reinstate all the restrictions on business rejoin the international rush for climate control a movement that gags on a gnat and swallows a camel ignoring the worst polluters while penalizing the cleaner nations exponentially raise taxes and the myriad of giveaway programs that at least one candidate admits would cost sixteen trillion dollars.  Can you envision what would happen to commerce if just the petroleum industry was done away with?  And you could say the same for any major industry in America because its not just manufacturing or producing the product that provides jobs there is an abundance of satellite businesses that are dependent on any large enterprise and the removal of said enterprise can turn a thriving city into a ghost town in a matter of weeks. Apartment complexes and retail outlets from the mom and pop variety to the big lots and discount chain retailers find themselves without customers almost overnight.  Ive seen this happen Ive seen the sad shells of vacant cities storefronts boarded up trash blowing around on empty streets after the major employer in the area has shut down or moved away.  The truth of the matter is that America is thriving and there are reasons for that.  A business-friendly atmosphere and the lifting of commerce crippling restrictions plus reasonable tax structures make for record low unemployment and situations like I saw in Midland Texas a town bursting at the seams with prosperity.  I would like to see a town hall meeting of the Democratic presidential candidates be held in a place like Midland and hear the candidates answer questions about the promises they are all making.  I would like to see it explained to these people how doing away with fossil fuel and all the other ridiculous proposals are going to pay back sixteen trillion dollars after Americas manufacturing and energy sectors have been put out of business.  Ive heard it said that Einsteins definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result.  I guess socialists just have hard heads.  What do you think?

"How Protectionist is Trump on Trade?  Recently every day you can expect to see another piece in the news about how Trump's trade agenda is a rollback to protectionism and a dangerous directive that could threaten our economy. News agencies cite statements by economists that his idea of tariffs and strong-arming other economies into new trade rules is outdated and nonsensical. Economists do tend to majority agree that tariffs end up costing consumers with the benefits being inefficiently allocated to those domestic industries which cannot compete with foreign industry. But many economists also hold views on issues which many of these same people in the news media as well as their viewers would object to. Issues such as minimum wage welfare and price controls on things like rental housing. How is it that we see news agencies pick and choose when to cite economists or to be more precise when to choose the ""right"" economists to propagate the articles being published? Are there economists who hold views somehow aligned with Trump's trade policy?  Some things should first be clarified which are usually not laid out in mainstream media programs and articles. The tariffs being discussed are a tax on imported goods levied by the government of the country to which those goods are imported into. The tariff is levied on a ""ad valorem"" basis which means as a percentage of the good's value. So if an importer pays $100 for a good and the tariff is 5% the government would collect $5 in tariff revenue. In the case of tariffs on imports to the United States the duty of collecting this money is delegated to the US Customs Service. There are currently thousands upon thousands of items all listed with tariffs in the United States Harmonized Tariff Schedule a listing of all classifications of products and their corresponding tariff rates.  This crucial fact is often not clarified. We already have tariffs on a huge list of goods which also leads to something equally crucial: many other countries targeted by Trump all maintain their own tariffs and those tariffs are higher than the ones we impose on them when their products come to the US. For example in data from the World Trade Organization's database on tariff profiles in 2016 the average tariffs scheduled across all products by the United States to other members of the WTO in our tariff schedule was 3.5%. For the European Union that rate was 5.2%. For China 9.9%. For India 13.4%. The reasoning given behind this is that these countries need to maintain barriers in order for them to develop their own domestic industry. Surely you can see the contradiction in that. And indeed the White House has pointed out this fact publicly. Trump himself has many times referred to the tariffs on cars being higher in the EU and China than the US.  In 2007 a Cambridge economist named Ha-Joon Chang wrote a controversial book discussing this exact issue titled ""Bad Samaritans: The Myth of Free Trade and the Secret History of Capitalism"". The basic premise of his book is that most economists espouse the benefits of free trade many of them as if it's almost unquestionable. But somehow many tend to overlook very basic facts and history on how trade actually works or has worked. Chang goes on to talk about the United States' protectionist history but more notably of economies like Japan and his native South Korea and how they barricaded their markets with high tariffs and other barriers to allow domestic industry to grow. Ireland Singapore China and many other countries industries and companies follow in the book with examples.  Beyond Trump his team on trade draws from several people with extensive experience. Robert Lighthizer is the current United States Trade Representative. He was involved in the similar US-Japan trade negotiations in the 1980's. Many would probably guess that Ronald Reagan was staunchly ""free trade"" since he is usually imagined as sharing heavily conservative views. In reality Reagan had Lighthizer and others work hard to impose all sorts of trade actions including tariffs on Japan during his administration. The same talk of ""protectionism"" was frequently heard. At the time Japan was being accused of unfairly barricading their markets and not allowing foreign competition while the US freely allowed trade flows from Japan to the US. Japan was said to be the next world leader. Many economists and other figureheads of the time said that Japan was surely on the path to lead the world. People even sent their children off to school to learn Japanese because they thought their economy would play such a crucial role in the global system. This all sounds eerily familiar with much of the rhetoric regarding China at the moment. In the end Reagan and his team got their way and levied many measures against Japan. The US is still the powerhouse economy of the world. Today much of the economic headlines regarding Japan talk of stagnation and failed directives. It couldn't be any more opposite to that era of 30 years ago.  Working alongside US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer is Wilbur Ross the current Secretary of Commerce. CNBC has had Ross on their channel several times to talk about trade policy. One of the interviews featured Ross explaining the price effects of the aluminum and steel tariffs considering the costs are directly passed on to consumers by producers of goods. He showed that a soup can's price would increase fractions of a cent while a new car's price would increase around 1%. It's possible these examples were specifically chosen because steel and aluminum play a comparatively smaller part in the production costs of those goods than many others. For example what would happen if this analysis were done on a manufacturer of pure steel doors or pure steel kegs? What goods that are necessities or frequently bought would stand to see steep price increases if any and by how much would they increase? This type of analysis is almost never reflected in the news or even in more academic sources. Kudos must be given to Ross for taking a layman's approach that uses simple and easy-to-understand examples.  An example of protected industry that I experienced myself was in Japan while shopping for groceries. Things like apples can be around $1 each. You can find many things there which are more expensive than here in the US. The reason for this is that Japan must import much of its produce but also because it heavily protects its agricultural industry. In the recent TPP trade deal that was signed Japan specifically required that rice beef and pork wheat some dairy products and sugar would all not be included in the deal. In deals such as TPP countries agree to lower tariff rates on certain products in exchange for the participating countries to also lower their tariff rates. Why does Japan force its people to pay higher prices for agriculture? You would think from this that the consumer is much worse off. Maybe Japanese citizens even really have problems paying for food. Yet in reality Japan boasts one of the largest if not the largest middle classes of any society on this entire planet. On May 18th Reuters reported that the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association issued a statement that it hoped other countries (hello USA) would maintain low tariffs on automobiles ensuring a preservation of our system of ""free trade"". If Japan is such a proponent of free trade why is their agricultural sector setup this way? Could it have to do with politics and special interests? Or are there other reasons? Regardless obviously there is some hypocrisy among many parties in this ongoing trade debate.  Another interesting component is how the media has notably changed its view on the trade picture. New York Times ran several articles talking about how imports in certain industries had surged and how we may need to protect our own industry. A New York Times economic correspondent even wrote a book in the run-up to the 2016 Presidential election entitled ""Why Manufacturing Still Matters"". The Huffington Post featured an article on Japan being a currency manipulator and protectionist nation then much of the media acted confused when Trump suggested Japan was a currency manipulator. Even Bernie Sanders was a vocal proponent of pulling out of the TPP which the media has vilified Trump for doing. Why this sudden change of heart since the new administration took the helm? Why is the reporting on trade matters so incredibly murky contradictory and misreported?  If Trump's trade ideas are so crazy and tariffs so bad then what of the current tariffs we and other nations already have? Why are other nations being allowed to maintain higher barriers? Should they be afforded this? Why do other nations protect their own industry? If they do it why shouldn't we? What of the growth achieved by other economies with protectionist policy like Germany and China both with strong manufacturing bases? If tariffs are enacted on these goods considering the costs are passed off directly to consumers how much would prices actually increase? 0.5% or 50%? Why is this never quantified? There are so many questions left unanswered. Before you believe all the rhetoric from the news organizations on the White House's trade agenda just remember that you are not being given the full picture.",political,Facebook

Promises Promises - Charlie's Soapbox 4/26/19  As the rolls of those who are seeking the Democratic nomination for president continue to swell it would seem that most of those who have thrown their hat in the ring have come to the conclusion that the candidate who promises the most free goods and entitlements will be the one to win and to win at all costs the security economy and welfare of the United States of America be damned.  For instance Elizabeth Warren proposes to forgive 95% of college loan debt which at present stands at over one and a half trillion dollars and exceeds the total American credit card debt by over five hundred billion dollars.  She proposes to pay for the debt forgiveness by a two percent tax on wealthier Americans which sounds like a good idea to most people until you ask yourself who these wealthier Americans are and what their income level is and realize that a two percent tax on only the very wealthy would probably not even pay the interest on what Ms. Warren wants to do.  So what happens then?  Well the liberal line is toed and the criteria for tax increases has dropped another notch down another income level and when that doesnt meet the demand another notch until it reaches the majority of the working people.  Having wealthier Americans bear the brunt of social programs like Ms. Warren wants to institute is a myth the numbers simply dont add up and when you stop and realize that the college loan debt forgiveness is only the tip of Ms. Warrens massive giveaway program and start adding it up the free health care the subsidized college education plus a twenty-two trillion national debt there is only one conclusion to come to.  National bankruptcy exponential inflation the total collapse of the American dollar and as the Borrow from Peter to pay Paul liberal mentality takes hold our national security would be in dire jeopardy because its a well-known fact that liberals dont have much use for the military and would cut our defense budget to the bone to pay for their ever-increasing social programs.  And all this time taxes keep going up.  If you want to see a microcosm of America under the ultraliberal rule of Elizabeth Warren Bernie Sanders and the lions share of the Democratic presidential candidates take a look at California and New York.  The tax burden in both states is cruel and people are leaving in droves headed for the states with no state income tax and the overall tax burden is much lighter and those states are experiencing unprecedented and economic prosperity.  New York Mayor Bill De Blasio unknowingly made the case for lower taxes when he said that they had taxed the rich and the rich were now leaving NYC.  And of course the answer in these Democrat controlled state is always to raise the taxes on the ones who are left the tolls the license fees anything to increase revenue which conversely decreases the population as another stratum of society finds it impossible to have any quality of life and moves to Texas Tennessee Florida or some other booming state where jobs are plentiful and you get to keep more of the money you make.  Now imagine the entire country being governed by the same fiscal philosophy as the aforementioned states the difference being that theres no place left to go no safe haven no lower tax states as federal taxes and regulations devour the fabric of society companies begin a mass exodus out of the nation the entitlement rolls expand the workers who pay the taxes to support them retract inflation is rampant and the price of even the essentials of life rises to unacceptable levels as the dollar shrinks and is no longer the standard currency in international trade requiring the U.S. to buy currency from a more stable country to purchase imports.  There is an eternal truth that needs to dawn on Washington and the younger generations who have been deprived of being educated about the pitfalls of socialism.  That is nothing but the Grace of God is free everything else is paid for by somebody and the money used to pay off college debt and provide free college free medical care and all the other pie in the sky social services comes out of some Americans pocket.  And that pocket eventually gets empty or gets the heck out of Dodge and Margaret Thatchers famous line about socialism being great until you run out of other peoples money comes into play.  The Democratic Party has evidently decided to pull out all the stops this trip and go the softball route by not allowing Fox News to host a debate evidently afraid that there would be serious questions asked questions the American people have a right to hear the answers to hoping that the voters will buy a pig in a poke a one-eyed jack never seeing the other side of its face.  And there are some very profound questions that need to be answered by the Democrats this time around questions that the fawning sycophants in the mainstream media will in all likelihood never ask or at least never push to a definitive answer.  What is your conviction about killing a baby that has been delivered or is living in the birth canal?  What do you intend to do about the flow of illegals across our southern border?  Do you defend sanctuary cities and do you consider them to be illegal?  Do you believe that people incarcerated in prisons have a right to vote?  Do you view our 22 trillion-dollar debt a threat to the nation and if so what do you intend to do about it?  To what degree do you support the United States Military and what priority would you place on financing it to keep it the best equipped in the world?  Would you keep the sanctions and everything else at our disposal on Iran to stop their nuclear program?  What is your attitude toward Israel and to what degree would you go to protect their sovereignty?  How do you stand on the Green New Deal?  to what degree would you protect religion and its institutions?  Do you believe in American exceptionalism?  What do you think?

Congratulations to Paul McDonald and Bernie Mettler on advancing through the primary. Best of luck in November! It was nice getting to know all of the candidates this summer. Im sure we would all agree it was a great learning experience. I would like to thank all of you for your support this summer. Whether it was walking in those scorching hot parades financial support putting my signs out or just your words of encouragement. It meant so much to me to have this outpouring of support from my community. I couldnt have done this without support from my wife and family. It seemed like there was always a deadlne to meet or something needed to be picked up or delivered and you always made sure it happened. A special thank you Troy Swanson my director of social media. Troy was in charge of my website and Facebook page and his knowledge of the use of social media is second to none. Im sorry it didnt turn out the way you wanted Troy but it wasnt from your lack of effort. Last but not least Thank you to my campaign manager my daughter Mallory! The work she put in to this was unbelievable. Until you get involved in a campaign like this you have no idea how much behind the scenes work it takes to do this. For someone who has never done this before she never missed a step. As a candidate I couldnt have found anyone to work as hard as she did. As a Dad I am so proud of her undying faith in me and Im sure it has something to do with her love for her father. I love you Mallory and I am so glad we were able to use this campaign to strengthen our father/daughter relationship. These words cant even come close to describing how proud I am of you!

"Look if we look at the real picture we can see that Bernie is the top runner at this point--we see other pundits stealing from him the momentum he created. Bernie started this and created the movement that these newbies have jumped in on. But Bernie let's look at his record: walked with Dr. Martin Luther King has always supported equal rights for all; equal pay; LGBTQ; single payer Medicare; free tuition at public collages; free pre kindergarten; housing and full medical for Vet's with options to go to a regular Dr. if no VA is near; 6 weeks of natal pay for both parents; making the rich pay their fare share; protecting gun rights for responsible people--and the list goes on! Why are people afraid of a Democratic Socialist? Let's get one thing strait about a Democratic Socialist a Democratic Socialist has capitalism working for all the people not just the 1%. A more equitable system that balances the scales so that all benefit from the wealth that America creates--Bernie does not want to pull apart capitalism he just wants to give us the people of this country it's fare share--you got a problem with having more? Not working two or three jobs just to make it? The greatest programs that we have now that help us is: One; Social Security: Two; Medicare and Medicaid: Three; VA benefits--and the list goes on! All brought by a Socialist President! Let's remember that every single Democratic President has had our debt reduced and every single Republican President has raised it! Remember Trump promised us that we would get more at tax time--did you get it? I doubt it as a matter of fact when he got rid of deductions I bet most of you got way less! How about you; policemen? And you nurses? Teachers who have to supply stuff for their kids because the schools are so under funded? Who did I forget? I know there are so many more. Hey did the ""huge"" (as Trump would say) tax breaks for the rich trickle down to your pocket? Give me a brake! You may not like Bernie for whatever reason but he is a seasoned politician who's been in the game for a very long time and knows how to get things done and cross the great divide Republicans have created.

"[From the Bernie Sanders Campaign today with the subject ""Joe Biden""]  Dear Friends  Yes. These are crazy times. We're dealing with a pandemic an economic meltdown the struggle for racial justice and we're seeing the destruction caused by climate change in Iowa California Louisiana and Texas.  But in the midst of all of this we have got to remain focused focused focused. In 65 days the most important election in modern American history will be taking place and we have got to defeat Donald Trump. We have got to defeat him not only because he is a pathological liar because he rejects science and because he is a racist and a xenophobe. We have got to defeat him because he is undermining American democracy and is rapidly moving this country into an authoritarian type of society something we may never recover from.  In terms of defeating Trump one of the issues that has not gotten the attention that it deserves is the real contrast that exists between Trump's economic agenda and the economic proposals being supported by Joe Biden. At a time when our country is struggling with the worst economic meltdown since the great depression this is an issue of enormous consequence for tens of millions of working class families.  Let me be clear. Biden's economic agenda is not mine and does not go as far as I and many of you wish it would. But on the other hand at a time of massive and growing income and wealth inequality there is no question but that his proposals are strong and will go a long long way toward improving life for working families.  Yesterday I made an important speech about this issue on our social media channels. Let me summarize here what I said about Joe's plans for the economy.  Minimum Wage When Joe Biden is president he will increase the federal minimum wage from a starvation wage of $7.25 an hour to a living wage of $15 an hour. And lets be clear: When we increase that minimum wage to $15 an hour we will be raising the wages of more than 40 million workers.  Unions Joe Biden also knows that if we are going to expand the middle class in this country we must make it easier for workers to join unions engage in collective bargaining and end the heavy-handed corporate tactics that make it hard for workers to unionize in America.  Infrastructure And here's something else that Joe Biden understands. And that is that in the midst of the worst economic crisis in our lifetimes we need to create millions of good-paying jobs through a massive investment in rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure  our roads bridges sidewalks schools water systems and affordable housing.  Paid Family and Medical Leave Like most of us Joe Biden is embarrassed that the United States is the only major nation on earth not to guarantee paid medical and family leave. Thats why Joe has proposed at least 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave for working families.  Childcare And when we talk about babies and young children we all know that our current childcare system is totally inadequate. Our children and their parents deserve high-quality reliable and affordable childcare. Thats why Joe has proposed universal pre-K education for every 3- and 4-year-old in the country.  Colleges And when we talk about making sure that we have the best educated workforce in the world Joe understands that we need to make public colleges universities and trade schools tuition-free for working families.  Prescription Drugs As some of you may recall last year I traveled to Canada with a group of diabetics to buy insulin a life and death drug for more than 30 million Americans. And here's what we found. You can buy insulin in Canada a few miles from our border for 1/10th the price that it is sold here. No. You didn't mishear me. The same product made by the same company is sold for 1/10th the price that it's sold here. But it's not just Canada and its not just insulin. While the drug companies through their collusion price fixing and greed make obscene profits we pay by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. Joe Biden understands that we must take on the pharmaceutical industry and significantly lower drug prices in this country.  Health Care As many of you know the United States is the only major country not to guarantee health care for all people. Meanwhile despite paying almost twice as much per capita for health care as the people of other countries over 90 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured and over half a million Americans go bankrupt because they cannot afford to pay their medical bills.  While Joe and I disagree on the best path to get to universal coverage his proposal will greatly expand access to health care and make it more affordable for tens of millions across this country.  My friends of course many of us wish our campaign would have won the Democratic primary. But now our first priority must be to defeat Donald Trump the most dangerous president in modern American history.  Then on Day 1 of the Biden administration we will mobilize the working families of this country to demand a government that represents all of us and not just the few.  So I am asking you today to do something important  because Donald Trump and the Republican Party would love nothing more than to divide our supporters up as people start to vote. And the truth is the corporate media would love nothing more than to write stories about how we are not united in the fight to beat Trump.  So I am asking:  Add your name: help me send a message that you are committed to voting to defeat Donald Trump this November. This is important.  We live in the wealthiest nation in the history of the world but that reality means very little because almost all of that wealth is controlled by a tiny handful of individuals.  This November we take the first step to turn that around and to create a government that works for all of us and not just the 1 percent.  In solidarity  Bernie Sanders",political,Facebook
