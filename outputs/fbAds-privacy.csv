"Over the past few months President Biden continues to push America towards an authoritarian state. He recently announced a proposal that financial institutions report transactional activity for any bank account that has an inflow outflow or aggregate amount totaling $600 in a year.  This bar for monitoring is so low that most citizens on unemployment social security benefits and Medicare would have every financial transaction monitored.  To bring it to a more personal level if your child takes a summer job mowing lawns and opens a savings account for that funding then he or she would likely be monitored as well.  While the stated goal of this vast data collection is to uncover tax dodging by the wealthy this proposal is not remotely targeted to that purpose or population.  Last time we checked the median household here in Idaho is roughly $61000 a year. Nearly every Idahoan family would be on that list from monitoring as one of the ""rich"" paying their share.  The false pretense of closing the tax-gap would give unprecedented data collection authority to the federal government with limited return on investment for citizens.  It is also unclear how the IRS will use this data to accomplish its goal.  Further the federal governments history of keeping this type of data secure is dubious at best. The IRS is one of several government systems that has recently experienced a data breach and financial institutions across the country are highly concerned about the governments ability to keep personal financial data secure.  Lets be real this is an unprecedented invasion of privacy masquerading as an effort to reduce the tax gap.  This is not acceptable and Congress must act.",political,Facebook
Cori Schumacher and her cohorts so desperately want her for the District 1 council seat they've now reached a new low even for them. They have resorted to SPAM TEXTING citizens of D1 with a plea to sign their petition for a special election including using the recipients name in the message. They have obviously acquired a cell personalized phone list and have no qualms about invading your privacy. This is so much more intrusive and inappropriate than spam emails or spam phone calls. But like Cori her people will go to any lengths to get what she wants. And don't think she didn't know about and approve of these tactics. They are a coordinated machine that always works together. We can expect more of these undesirable methods if there is a special election. Carlsbad deserves so much better.,political,Facebook
"Getting back on track in this series we left off a couple of weeks ago about to discuss rights warrants and consent. To start this topic which we will only brush the surface consider where these rights are memorialized. I say memorialized intentionally because the founders believed these rights are inherent that is we are born with them. They are memorialized in the 4th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. Every state Constitution has its own version of this amendment. The Amendment states the every person has the right to be secure in their persons places and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures. Further that no search nor seizure shall occur except by a warrant issued by a judge on a showing of probable cause particularly describing the place to be searched or the person or thing to be seized. So the Constitution has very specifically defined how these rights are to be protected. You can read the actual Amendment and you will notice there are no exceptions to its requirements. There is an anecdote I once heard that Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes was asked why there were no Supreme Court cases on the 4th Amendment. He supposedly stated that the Amendment was so direct in its pronouncement and so clear in its prohibitions that no such case were ever necessary. Today there tens if not hundreds of thousands of cases on the 4th Amendment. Oddly there is only one case which gets the bulk of criticism. That is the ""exclusionary rule"". This rule arose from the U.S. v. Weeks case in 1913 and was later found applicable to state cases in Mapp v. Ohio. This rule states succinctly if the police illegally obtain the evidence then it is inadmissible in court against the accused. The criticism is that it may let the guilty escape conviction by keeping out evidence which could prove guilt. But the criticism is short sighted and misses the bigger issue. The critics would permit official illegal conduct to prevail against the citizen. If the government is to be the bearer of the mantle of justice then it must play by the same rules as it holds its citizens. When the government becomes the law breaker there must be some accountability and the Supreme Court in those cases found exclusion as the mechanism to do that. Unfortunately since Mapp was decided in 1961 there has been a large scale retreat from its mandate and there have been several attempts to eliminate the rule altogether. On the other hand many cases have given the police greater lattitude to search and seize without consulting a magistrate or judge before doing so (the term police is used generically and includes all types of law enforcement agents state or federal) . Some such ""exceptions"" are the ""automobile exception"" ""officer safety exception"" exigent circumstances exception"" ""officer probable cause belief exception"" and finally consent. Yet like the exclusionary rule none of these exceptions appear in the Amendment. These are judge made exceptions. They expand the powers of the police in ways not envisioned nor permitted by the Constitution. Of these exceptions the only one you as the citizen have at your disposal is consent. Because of its extensive use by the police it is the one you are most likely to encounter if you have a police contact. However it will probably be presented to you in a most casual manner which disguises its intent and scope. Borrowing from the anti-drug use campaign Just Say No. The most frequent application of the consent request is to motorists stopped for some trivial traffic violation. After being advised they are only getting a warning the questioning shifts to the contents of the car or other vehicle. Whether there is anything illegal in the vehicle and can the officer ""take a quick look"". This search has nothing to do with the alleged traffic violation and every driver and passenger should Just Say No. At the point of being asked for consent you are legally free to go as you should have already been given your license registration and insurance documents back. Tell the officer to have a nice day and leave. I say that especially if you are innocent of any illegal activity. We do not live in a police state where we need permission to go about our normal lives. Do not take the bait that ""if you have nothing to hide"". That is a phony analogy. Ask the officer if you can come watch him and/or his wife bath if they have nothing to hide. That hyperbole demonstrates the irrelevance of the ""nothing to hide"" bait its not about hiding its about your rightful privacy and an invasion without cause by the police. So in summary the police legally need a warrant according to the Constitution can get by sometimes on one of the court made exceptions or get your consent. Never give up a right needlessly. These are your rights use them or lose them. Be safe and be aware.",political,Facebook

Our Week-end Updates Always Contain Important Information We Need To Pass Along To You.  Please take the 5 or 10 minutes it takes to read them. The last few years have been a time of great peril. There are very few groups like ours in existence. We cant bury our heads in the sand and try to ignore what is going on. We must be aware and vigilant. As followers of Jesus that is what were called to do. As Jesus said he sends us out as sheep in the midst of wolves so we must be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.

END OF UPDATE).***  Have you ever heard of a Christian ministry that attracted a good share of atheists agnostics pagans Buddhists Muslims people of Jewish faith and many others as allies? Perhaps such is the case for us because we place the words actions and teachings of Jesus front and center at all times. We often compare and contrast those teachings with what we see happening in the world especially in government and culture. A large percentage of people see the teachings of Jesus as truth regardless of their background.  You cant tell us that treating a group of people differently in a mean spiteful humiliating way or discriminating against them because you dont approve of their sexuality is Christian.  You cant tell us that taking more food away from the hungry is Christian.  You cant tell us that taking health care away from anyone at all is Christian.  You cant tell us taking dominion over a womens body her medical choices her privacy her family planning choices her safety or a future she may not want is Christian.  You cant tell us treating immigrants escaping from danger violence or extreme poverty like animals or calling them an infestation is Christian.  You cant tell us deporting people who have grown up in this country is Christian.  You cant tell us bankrupting the country so you can take away social services necessary for the survival of those who are elderly poor sick disabled. injured hungry homeless or mentally ill Christian.  We Christians who arent brainwashed recognize all these patterns of behavior for what they are a cult and its an evil cult that has nothing to do with Jesus. Frankly were a little bit stunned that so many so-called Christians cant see that. Its the opposite of what Christ taught. Its not even hard to see that which is why we dont get it.  If you claim to follow Jesus you can't disregard everything he taught or claim that it only applies to individuals. The Law of Love is simple and universal. It applies to all things. Jesus taught us to Love God and Love our neighbors as we do ourselves. He said all the law and all the prophets could be summed up in these two commands the Law of Love.  40 years of billions spent in messaging from false teachers is hard to break through.

URGENT: The Town Council is set to pass a resolution on Wednesday 5/29 at 6pm to approve a contract with Host Compliance LLC for Short-Term Rental monitoring. It unnecessarily spends over $5000 of taxpayer money to enforce an unjust and un-recoupable regulatory regime on a relative few residents. It will invade your privacy by encouraging anonymous complaints - a clear attack on your right to due process and confrontation of your accuser - rather than funneling complaints through Airbnb's Neighbors program which is free and exists TODAY. And it it locks the town into an auto-renewing contract that the next administration may not want or need.  You showed up in force last week at Tri-Village Firehouse to express your concerns about the proposed zoning law. Please turn out again at 6pm tomorrow at Chatham Town Hall to express your displeasure with the heavy-handed route Supervisor Lull and the Town Council are taking.

I need to ask you all for the greatest favor.  I am asking that if you do not see my name on your ballot for Tuesday Please write me in.  I do not believe the election results of 2020 are certifiable.  I do not think the election would be fair to be redone with the existing candidates.  I ask that I be considered a write in.  I will take the role for no salary as Mr. Trump did. I know how difficult this must be to read for so many reasons.  I can only do the new salary portion of us because Im relying on my businesses getting going.  Should this all work out somehow I promise that I will do my absolute best at giving 110% to the daily roles and responsibilities I will need to take over  My entire life was geared toward one goal and without a college education there doesnt seem like another pathway for me to D.C  Most of my apparent mania was because of this goal.  My long term objectives are pretty well laid out.  Affordable Housing Medicare for All Welfare Reform Initiate a war on Homelessness  Education Reform Social Security Overhaul  Transportation Railway and Infrastructure corrections and modifications  Implementation of high end internet security devices and software across the country to remove the risk of data privacy issues for both civilians and government.  I know all the questions you may have and why you may say how do you think you could be qualified  The only answer I have is I feel as if I were always going to end up right here.  I believe that we have a tremendous amount of work to do.  The world didnt quite catch up to us in Avi-tech? But the proximity blew me off my chair this last July.  I spent my 4th of July watching the supply chain issue begin. It has been heart wrenching to know that the world relies so heavily on tech however the big 4 corporations chose not to do more.  I see this as negligent at a level that is unreasonable.  Biometrics for logging onto the computer and the Internet have been around a long time and Im not quite sure this push didnt happen years ago.  #1dayatatime,political,Facebook

To our valued customers.   We fully support and are complying with the State of Ohio Health Departments' mask mandate. You will see the signs posted on our doors of all locations.  We ask and require ALL NON EXEMPT customers and employees to wear a mask and to also try to practice social distancing when possible. Since our employees do typically work independently we do not require a mask to be worn if they are isolated back in the employee area. The Health Department has confirmed that this is acceptable.  We have also confirmed with the Health Dept IN PERSON that our policy is IN FULL COMPLIANCE with the State of Ohio mask mandate.  However we ask that you also keep the following in mind: There are legitimate health exemptions from wearing the masks. Businesses & Employers cannot ask employees nor customers what their exemption is this is illegal.  Additionally our business is unique in that employees are not always on duty.  If you are in our stores and see a customer or employee not wearing a mask this is because they have proclaimed a medical exemption.   If you are in our stores and forget your masks our employees are happy to provide one for you free of charge when they are on duty.  We sincerely appreciate everyone's patience and understanding during these trying times. As a family owned business we care about your health safety and personal privacy and we will continue to respect them all! God Bless ,political,Facebook
"Whos on First? - Charlie's Soapbox 8/16/19  When I went to grammar school there were kids in my classes who when election time rolled around would be for different candidates than I was or rather their parents were as we were all way too young to grasp the implications or ramifications of whichever candidates were on the ballot.  In my family my parents and grandparents - having lived through the Great Depression - whatever candidates who ran in the Democrat side of the ballot were favored as Roosevelt was hailed as the president who ended the hard times as they were commonly known and Herbert Hoover whose name was practically synonymous with a curse word and the Republican Party wore the blame for decades.  My friends and playmates whose families favored the republican candidates simply reflected the thoughts and choices they had heard at home and conversely the kids from the Democrat homes did the same.  But there was never any animosity anger or grudges held against opposing sides a situation akin to whether you were a New York Yankees fan or a Brooklyn Dodgers fan as most of the boys of my acquaintance were in those days of smaller baseball leagues and limited choices.  Politics for the most part in those days before the coming of television was more a distraction whose conventions and coverage took up valuable radio time usually devoted to The Lone Ranger and the myriad of afternoon broadcast time slots allotted to programming for the pee-wee set.  Even in high school we paid more attention to - but took no umbrage at - each others political choices and they affected our relationships not one whit.  I dont know exactly when we began to be so divided by politics that we feel it is incumbent upon us to totally disrespect the opinions of others as to let it divide friends and family and that in some circles verbal disagreement is not enough and we are obliged to harm or even destroy those who disagree with us.  This is not a brand new thing but has grown in intensity over the last few years certainly exacerbated by the advent of the twenty-four-hour cable news networks especially the ones that show political bias which is practically all of them mainstream media and radio talk shows notwithstanding.  Our two most recent presidents are probably the most polarizing figures to hold the office in over a century and both have a sizable contingency of dedicated followers firmly convinced that there is no middle ground that it is a winner take all scenario a never give an inch ""hooray with our side and to hell with yours"" attitude. Fanned by the hyperbolic and asinine remarks of ambitious politicians who pander to any and all.  This situation although intolerable now will surely reach a fever pitch in the coming months of no holds barred campaigning and by the time the actual election rolls around the bloody campaign trail will be littered with the bodies of the also-rans victims of the better-spoken better-financed who cared not at all for the voracity of their acidic remarks nor the reputations or permanent damage done to any opponent who dared stand between them and the power they seek.  The truly dangerous part of this national conundrum is the hate it generates the belief that it is our obligation to despise the other side that their opinions are not even worthy to be heard and should be suppressed and shouted down instead of being fairly aired in the arena of ideas both sides weighed and evaluated by all voters in the constitutionally mandated process of one person one vote to be decided in the privacy of the ballot box and counted in a fair and impartial way.  Where does it end? I honestly dont know.  But this I do know.  It would serve the nation well for both sides to stick to the issues dial back the name calling and personal insults the groundless accusations the vendettas and the making of promises that are impossible to fulfill.  Is it possible?  Being the optimist that I am I believe it is.  Once in a while something happens that pulls us together that brings home the fact of how precious our country is to us and that no candidate or political party deserves our allegiance as much as our nation does that we need to find some common ground and stand on it politics be damned.  I dont know when I dont know how I dont know what but we will at some time in the future experience such an event and realize just how far we have drifted from God and the principles that made this nation what it is.  We can find the way back but it leads through repentance and common sense.  If my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then I will hear from heaven and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land. - 2 Chronicles 7:14  What do you think?

"Privacy settings won't allow me to simply share the following via Facebook. However my dear friend WT Sorrell went out of his way to write this amazing testimonial in support of my campaign and I am sharing with you my Facebook followers by copying the post from WT's page.  I can't thank him enough. I am so humbled by his observations and compliments.  Willie Sorrell 9 hrs  I voted today for Francis Hildebran and I encourage everyone in the Valdese election to vote for Francis also. I have known Francis for almost 35 years and have never known a more dedicated public servant or one who takes their responsibilities as seriously as Francis does. I worked with her while she was the Town Clerk for Valdese and was impressed by her responsiveness attention to detail and desire to get things right the first time. She was very well respected by the other Town Clerks in North Carolina. I was a founding member along with Francis of the Cornerstone Baptist Church and served with her on many many committees. She was a driving force behind the efforts to construct the new church with the Carpenters for Christ organization. I watched as she cared for her family and raised her son. Francis was instrumental in the Cornerstone Youth group being so successful and helping the church to grow. Since Francis has been a member of the Valdese Town Council I have had several occasions to interact with the Council. I have always been impressed with her determination to understand all the issues being proposed or addressed questioning not only the expenditure of the Town's tax dollars but also the need for and benefits of the issues being proposed or addressed. Her overriding concern has always been the effect of decisions on the citizens she represents. She has strived to provide the benefits they desire while minimizing the impact on their finances. The responsibilities of a Town Council Member require a tremendous amount of time and Francis has been a tireless worker in that role. Francis is always in attendance at meetings and events when town business is being discussed and doing her best to assure that the dollars spent garner the best benefit possible for the citizens of Valdese. Valdese is recognized in the Western North Carolina area as a ""well run progressive town."" We can thank the present and past Valdese Council Members for that recognition. Please help us keep Valdese moving forward with solid sound experienced leadership. Re-elect Francis Hildebran to the Valdese Town Council on November the 5th! W.T.

Sharing questions and responses with you all from the inbox. Feel free to share your comments below if you wish.  Q: What are your thoughts on a uniform dress code for Onslow County Schools? Do you hear many people talking about that?  My response:  Hi XXXXXX! (Name edited for privacy) Thanks for reaching out.  The question on uniforms was asked to the candidates that participated in the Jacksonville Onslow Chamber of Commerce BOE forum.  My response is somewhat two fold. I understand that uniforms can eliminate the concerns of those students that may not have the best clothes etc. However I personally oppose the idea of uniforms because I believe that a childs individuality is an important part of building confidence and personal identity. I believe uniforms take away from that by stifling their ability to be their own person.  Our world looks very diverse and we need to cultivate our younger generations with facilitation of positive behavior compassion and kindness for the fellow man as human beings not by what we look like or wearing.  I hope this answers your question. Any other questions feel free to ask.   Kindly Melissa,political,Facebook
18 August 2020  Dear Dr. Adams  Like many members of the Connetquot community I have read your plan for reopening schools. I witnessed firsthand the discussions regarding reopening in September between District and union leadership. I appreciate the enormous task of creating a plan such as this for a district of any size in a year where many including you have experienced trauma and illness. I am in the unique position of having worked in a live television setting prior to becoming a teacher and I have taught via livestream at the university level. And despite my experience with creating resources to deliver high-quality instruction online and using technology to work in a live video environment to clearly get my point across I have questions.  First why did you announce the reopening plan to the Connetquot community and not share it with your instructional staff? Community members received the plan via email but our staff did not. I found out about your plan via a text message from a teacher who is a Connetquot parent otherwise I would have not known the plan was released.  How am I to teach to cohorts of students in person and via livestream in a responsible responsive flexible and intuitive manner?  How do I teach my students effectively if the Chromebooks that the District ordered do not arrive until sometime mid-Fall?  How do I achieve success in employing the variety of accommodations of my classified students some of whom I may never meet in person?  At what point in my teaching day would you suggest I respond to the hundreds of emails I may receive as was the case when we conducted remote instruction last Spring?  How am I to conduct laboratory investigations in a manner where the wonder is not lost since many students will watch a livestream of what could have been an excellent inquiry experience?  What method would you suggest is best to use to assess students both in person and virtually simultaneously and securely?  Is the District securing enough personal protective equipment for students to use in a laboratory setting if they are appropriately distanced?  Are we also wearing microphones so we can be heard by all in person and via livestream?  Am I able to conduct laboratory investigations outside with the students who are in school? Is the webcam portable?  Who is responsible for disinfecting the laboratory equipment after use?  Will the webcams arrive and be installed in time for teachers to practice with before the students begin on September 10th? If not what is the plan and how will the Connetquot community be notified?  Will there be a delay in the broadcasting of the livestream as is the case with all television network broadcasts from the news to sporting events and beyond?  How do I maintain the privacy of my students virtually and in person and for myself in the event that someone purposefully takes a screenshot or video recording of the livestream?  How do I protect myself from the rampant social media criticism that occurs from members within and beyond the Connetquot community? Stress over the very real possibility of people attempting character assassination of our incredible teachers has left me sleepless for more than a few nights.  What happens when technology issues occur and we cannot livestream? With students in the classroom I cannot be expected to pivot a lesson online to work asynchronously and maintain learning with my students in class.  There has been much focus on the hybrid plan for reopening schools. Has there been any thought as to what the plan will look like when schools have to close for any amount of time short- or long-term?  Lastly but with no less significance when will teachers receive professional development during the work week or during the school year as we are being asked to do so much with so little training? Certainly the best way to learn is not one time at the start of the year and never again but should be revisited and updated throughout the year. There seems to be no time built in for professional development at all in the current hybrid plan.  Again I do appreciate that all decisions regarding reopening were difficult to organize and I have looked at several other district plans. I do feel that this three-fold form of teaching in person to hybrid students and to 100% virtual students puts undue stress on my fellow teachers and on me. At a time where stress is running at an all-time high and with the likelihood of viral cases once again increasing to add additional layers of teaching that we collectively have never been trained for or have conducted before and that we very easily can be criticized and slandered for our faults is a difficult pill to swallow. I feel I am not being treated with the level of professionalism that I have earned for the level of degrees I hold for the years of experience I have with our district and absolutely not for the level of experiences I offer to my students.  -- Stephanie Burns Earth Science and Astronomy Teacher Connetquot High School STANYS Director at Large - Earth Science NYS Master Teacher Emeritus - Long Island,political,Facebook
"WHEN THE MESSAGE IS BAD... SUE THE MESSENGER! WELCOME TO THE NEWEST BANANA REPUBLIC SANS BANANAS!  Trump campaign demands CNN apologize for poll that shows Biden leading.  By Veronica Stracqualursi and Harry Enten CNN  Updated 3:54 PM EDT Wed June 10 2020  Washington(CNN)President Donald Trump's campaign is demanding CNN retract and apologize for a recent poll that showed him well behind presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.  The demand coming in the form of a cease and desist letter to CNN President Jeff Zucker that contained numerous incorrect and misleading claims was immediately rejected by the network.  ""We stand by our poll"" said Matt Dornic a CNN spokesman.  Biden builds largest lead this year  The CNN poll conducted by SSRS and released on Monday shows Trump trailing the former vice president by 14 points 55%-41% among registered voters. It also finds the President's approval rating at 38% -- his worst mark since January 2019 and roughly on par with approval ratings for one-term Presidents Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush at this point in their reelection years -- and his disapproval rating at 57%.  In the letter to Zucker the Trump campaign argued that the CNN poll is ""designed to mislead American voters through a biased questionnaire and skewed sampling.""  ""It's a stunt and a phony poll to cause voter suppression stifle momentum and enthusiasm for the President and present a false view generally of the actual support across America for the President"" read the letter signed by the Trump campaign's senior legal adviser Jenna Ellis and chief operating officer Michael Glassner.  View Trump and Biden head-to-head polling The campaign formally requested that CNN retract the poll and publish a ""full fair and conspicuous retraction apology and clarification to correct its misleading conclusions.""  David Vigilante CNN's executive vice president and general counsel told the campaign that its ""allegations and demands are rejected in their entirety.""  ""To my knowledge this is the first time in its 40-year history that CNN had been threatened with legal action because an American politician or campaign did not like CNN's polling results"" Vigilante wrote in his response.  ""To the extent we have received legal threats from political leaders in the past they have typically come from countries like Venezuela or other regimes where there is little or no respect for a free and independent media.""  After CNN released the poll earlier this week Trump tweeted that he had hired Republican pollster McLaughlin & Associates to ""analyze"" the survey and others ""which I felt were FAKE based on the incredible enthusiasm we are receiving."" McLaughlin ranks as one of the least accurate pollsters in the industry as measured by FiveThirtyEight.  But several other polls released over the past few weeks -- including polls by ABC News/Washington Post Monmouth University NPR/PBS Newshour/Marist College NBC News/Wall Street Journal Quinnipiac University and Fox News -- also show Biden well ahead of Trump. These polls averaged with the CNN poll find Biden up by double digits a result well outside any margin of error.  Misleading claims  The campaign's letter which heavily cites findings by McLaughlin makes several incorrect and misleading claims.  ""It's a poll of 1259 adults -- not even registered voters let alone likely voters"" the letter says citing a McLaughlin memo from earlier this week.  While it's accurate that 1259 adults were reached on landlines or cell phones by a live interviewer for the survey the 14-point margin by which Trump is trailing Biden came from a question posed only to 1125 registered voters. It's typical for polling to sample registered voters rather than likely ones at this stage of the race as it's difficult to project whether voters will participate in an election that is five months away. CNN as do most public pollsters typically reports results from likely voters around Labor Day.  It should be noted that in CNN's poll Biden expands his lead among those who are most (i.e. extremely) enthusiastic to vote.  Joe Biden hits a milestone Hillary Clinton never did: 50%  McLaughlin says CNN's survey is a ""skewed anti-Trump poll of only 25% Republican."" That percentage of respondents however is consistent with several other major polls that use live telephone interviews which provide the most reliable snapshot of the race. McLaughlin this week argued that pollsters should include a third of Republicans in surveys to reflect the 33% that they represented in the 2016 vote but exit polls nearly always have higher shares of partisans and lower shares of independents than pre-election phone polls.  Among the entire sample 32% identified themselves in CNN's poll as Democrats 25% identified themselves as Republicans and 44% described themselves as independents or belonging to another party. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points. It is 3.6 points among registered voters.  The letter to Zucker also includes McLaughlin's criticism that the poll conducted between June 2 and 5 was taken ""before the great economic news"" an improvement in the jobless rate that was released on Friday even though the poll was still being conducted throughout that day. And the survey comes amid an especially turbulent time in Trump's presidency including the ongoing coronavirus pandemic outrage and concern over race relations in the wake of George Floyd's killing at the hands of police officers and the US officially entering a recession.  Visit CNN's Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race  McLaughlin has also argued that the poll unfairly includes ""questions on issues including race relations not job creation which could have biased the poll further"" though CNN's survey does ask registered voters who would better handle the economy (Trump leads 51% to Biden's 46%) and was conducted at the height of the Floyd protests.  Trump has regularly chafed at polls that do not reflect favorably on him while promoting ones that do. Last month Trump bashed Fox News a network he often touts and gives interviews to for a telephone-conducted poll that showed him behind Biden by 8 points and instead pointed to a CNN poll released earlier in the month where he was leading Biden in battleground states. That CNN poll however showed Biden had a 5-point lead over Trump among registered voters nationwide.  ""Why doesn't @FoxNews put up the CNBC POLL or the (believe it or not!) @CNN Poll? Hope Roger A is looking down and watching what has happened to this once beautiful creation!"" Trump tweeted at the time referring to the late Fox News founder Roger Ailes. Trump has also credited CNN's polling when it has suited him as he did in December 2015 when he thanked several on-air reporters for their ""very professional reporting of the new CNN Poll"" that showed him ahead in the Iowa caucuses.

In these challenging and difficult times as Mayor of the great City of Linden I want to ensure you that all information concerning Covid-19 is presented to you in a timely and transparent manner. My administration will continue to do all things necessary to protect our residents by providing the services that our government provides. However even in this pandemic my administration is obligated to comply with certain laws that protect patient information and what can be shared publicly. The HIPAA Privacy Rule protects the privacy of patients' health information but is balanced to ensure that appropriate uses and disclosures of the information still may be made when necessary to protect a patient to protect the nation's public health and for other critical purposes. Consequently HIPAA still requires us to protect a patient's privacy however through the Linden Board of Health and our Health Officers if certain information is received about a resident who tests positive for Covid-19 they are required to follow certain protocols in notifying individuals that may have had CLOSE contact with that person and are able to take other steps to minimize the spread of the virus.

THE QUESTION OF MY CORE VALUES  Over the last week or so Ive been told about a malicious letter that has been sent to what appears to be a select group of voters. It has all the dirty markings of a Fletcher/Weckman/Crystal hit piece.  Im told that it primarily judges poorly my values and my private life. It's doing what it set out to do as Ive actually been asked about these points just this last weekend while hanging out in Loma Rica. Fortunately the voters after asking me these pointed questions tell me about the letter and say that they saw through the smear.  This said and thinking about this latest fear tactic Im actually excited to talk about some of my values most relevant to being your Supervisor:  I value honesty. I value integrity. I value fairness.  I value family. I value my hill persons values. I value our rural lifestyle.  I value tolerance. I value privacy. I value kindness.  I value hard work. I value doing whats right. I value follow through.  I value listening. I value being present. I value that we're all equal.  I value education. I value laws and safety. I value doing more with less.  I value cooperation. I value others ideas and perspectives. I value mutual beneficial change.  I value those less fortunate than me. I value those who know more than me. I value those who mentor me.  I value the opportunity before me. I value building trust between us. I value who I am.  Hope this helps those of you who might be scratching your head over that letter. Im sure there will be more questions. I will always make myself available to you to answer them.  #wrightforthepeople,political,Facebook

I have created to help bring attention to the fate of Nadia. She is an American Citizen stuck in Cairo Egypt. She is about to be homeless there. Nadia has 3 young sons. One is 11 and the twins are 10. Nadia was taken to Libya as a child by her father. She has been in Egypt for months. Attempts to get assistance from the American Embassy has provided almost nothing. The American Citizens Services office has phoned Nadia once and started a file on her. They embassy is mostly closed due to the pandemic. Attempts to get help from politicians here in the U.S. have been blocked because of red tape. Nadia Shenshen was born in Robinson Illinois in 1981. Nadias mother Etta is an American citizen who currently lives in Salem IL with her current husband. Nadias father Taher was a Libyan citizen going to Lincoln Trail Community Community College. Taher and Etta were married before Nadias birth. Nadia has a younger sister Samia and two half brothers living in the U.S. Nadia also has an extended family of a grandmother Aunt cousins etc... in the U.S. Nadias family is not wealthy and can not support her in Egypt. Nadia does not have a visa to work in Egypt. Many of Nadias former elementary school mates remember her fondly. Many have wondered whatever happened to their friend that never returned from the trip abroad with homer father. At this time I am asking people to email the embassy in Cairo demanding they help Nadia and her children. If you would also email you congress member it could be helpful. Please also share this page and get Nadias story to as many people as possible. Email the U.S. Embassy in Cairo at the following. Ask them to help Nadia Shenshen and American in Egypt.  CONSULARCAIROACS@state.gov   Nadias Story  Nadias father Taher took her and her sister Samia to Libya when they were 10 and 9 years old respectively. He did not bring them back to their mother in the United States. The girls had an extremely hard childhood in Libya. They were looked down on by many because they are half American and U.S. citizens. When their father remarried in Libya they were not treated well by their step mother. There are so many horrible stories that happened to Nadia as a child and young adult in Libya. I am trying to not tell her most personal stories. I can tell you she is a survivor and my heart breaks for her. In 2011 Libyan dictator Mummar Gaddafi was deposed and killed. Libyan became lawless and a civil war began. Nadias sister Samia and her children got out of Libya and to the U.S. with the help of the American government. During that time Nadia and her family were trapped in Misrata a hotspot during the war. Nadias family and I were sometimes able to contact Nadia but unable to help her in anyway. Misratas people were at the mercy of whatever militia or rebel leader was in control. Nadia was married to an Egyptian citizen living in Libya to say the least he was no help to her and their children. Again I will not go into to details to protect some of Nadias privacy. A few months ago during a break in the fighting Nadia and her family made it out of Libya to Egypt. They lived with her Egyptian husbands family. In Egypt Nadia was able to divorce her husband. She and her children lived with his family members for a few months. After many attempts Nadia was able to make an appointment to be seen at the American Embassy in Cairo. The Embassy was approximately 2 hours from where Nadia stayed. During her stay there some horrible things happened especially to her children which I can not mention. Nadia had to leave a get away from her ex husband and his family. She went to stay in Cairo with her cousin. Due to the pandemic the American embassy has shut down almost all operations in Cairo. Nadias appointment was canceled. Nadia has constantly been harassed by her ex husband while in Cairo. He threatens to take her children back to his family home where they were treated so terribly. He also threatens to have Nadia deported to Libya. The only thing that often keeps Nadia going is the love for her boys and hope of returning to her family in the U.S. If her ex husband takes the boys she will be devastated. If she is deported to Libya it may take many years to find a way to get out again. Also Misrata is often under siege due to the war. She would have to go to a refugee camp. There are sometimes cease fires but they never last. The dilemma now is Nadias cousin says she had the boys have to leave their apartment. It is a financial strain to have Nadia and her three boys there. Also because her ex husband is coming to the apartment arguing with Nadia and causing problems. Nadia has no where to go with her boys. She only has the little money I send her each month. It is not even enough to feed them let alone pay living expenses. Even if Nadia is seen at the embassy tomorrow getting her and her children to the U.S. will take months. The airfare is about $3000 for each. I am starting a Gofundme Campaign today. Any amount anyone can give is appreciated. Please share the campaign also. Thank you for your time and any help you can provide wether it is donating emailing or sharing Nadias story.,political,Facebook

RACE Listen.. I don't know about you but I am sick and tired of race being trotted out as an issue to divide us. It's 2020 I think we all get that humans come in many races. Hucksters try to make this a cause for alarm but I believe the American people aren't buying it. Is there really anyone left in 2020 who's family or friends don't consist of people of all races?  We humans come in a few different models; Black White Hispanic Asian Indian Middle-Eastern Indigenous peoples and the variations of all of these. A white person can never be black and a black person can never be white. To try to divide us on facts that can never be changed is the cheapest form of exploitation. It is a way of keeping us permanently divided because it can never be changed. We are the race we were born into. The effort to divide us by permanent facts is a tactic taken straight from places are on earth where people have been killing each other for centuries over unchangeable facts and age old hatreds. America was and is the cure for that hatred. Being an American is a concept it is a philosophy rooted in personal liberty and self determination unbound by ethnicity or race.  The race-baiters are purposely using race as a tactic to create hatred and division among us. And while they are getting us all worked up with shiny objects while they've got you distracted on unchangeable pigmentation they are stealing your liberty by suppressing free speech free expression and all the freedoms in the bill of rights. They have you arguing about race or gender while they are obliterating the 4th amendment by doing away with privacy and due process. They care nothing about your race they care about getting a strangle hold on power. They don't care what race you are they only want to use it to distract you in order to make themselves the permanent ruling class. It's a cheap trick and the most dastardly of all power grabs. America don't fall for it. We are all free people. The media and demagogues may not have figured it out but we the people know we are all in this together and are all one American family.,political,Facebook
URGENT: The Town Council is set to pass a resolution at their meeting on Wednesday 5/29 at 6pm to approve a contract with Host Compliance LLC for Short-Term Rental monitoring. It unnecessarily spends over $5000 of taxpayer money to enforce an unjust and un-recoupable regulatory regime on a relative few residents. It will invade your privacy by encouraging anonymous complaints - a clear attack on your right to due process and confrontation of your accuser - rather than funneling complaints through Airbnb's Neighbors program which is free and exists TODAY. And it it locks the town into an auto-renewing contract that the next administration may not want or need.  You showed up in force last week at Tri-Village Firehouse to express your concerns about the proposed zoning law. Please turn out again at 6pm Wednesday at Chatham Town Hall to express your displeasure with the heavy-handed route Supervisor Lull and the Town Council are taking.

"Selected iVoter Questions and Answers from Jeff Scott  When you consider your views on a wide range of issues from economic and social matters to foreign policy and immigration which of the following [on a scale from Very Conservative to Very Liberal] best describes you overall?  As a Libertarian I don't fit into this right-left one-dimensional scale. I'm neither left nor right. On fiscal matters I agree with many conservatives who don't want high taxes or to burden our children with increasing national debt. On social matters I agree with many traditional liberals who don't want to be told how to live their lives. Both the Democratic and Republican Parties have shown time and again that they are incapable of resisting the temptation to use government power to force others to do as they wish. They enjoy putting the boot of power on the neck of the people especially in the name of national security. They invade privacy stamp out free speech hassle peaceful cannabis users inflate the fear of foreigners restrict trade.  What should the United States do to help eradicate the threat of radical Islamic terrorism?  To eradicate the threat the US should end its war. The job of our military is to protect American lives. When we use destructive force with no clear reason we kill innocent civilians. American interventionism abroad leads to blowback. Real conservatives know that Americans can't search for monsters abroad and maintain tranquility at home. I support reductions in military spending and foreign aid to warring nations. I support limits on NATO expansion and reducing its role in regime change. I oppose war on Iran a country that does not threaten us. Our relation with Russia a nuclear power is at an all time low. I encourage the president to remove aggressive American financial sanctions on both Iran and Russia. We must restore international civility and diplomacy. Americans polled now say 2-to-1 that we should NOT have gone to war in Iraq and Afghanistan. We are war weary. Time to let third parties take their peace platforms to D.C.  How would you promote healthcare coverage that is adequate affordable and accessible for all?  I support repealing ACA. Third-party payer systems that 'cover all medical needs' are flawed since they mix spending on routine predictable events with unpredictable emergency costs. Buyers of medical care under ACA are trapped. If they stop paying high premiums they risk medical and financial catastrophe. As consumers plan or no plan they are threatened with absurd and opaque prices. Medical costs will continue to spiral out of control until customers pry out and drive down the prices of services. The problem of fake inflated prices that appear on medical bills will not be solved under the flawed Medicare4All either. Further I support competition in professional labor. We should break the medical cartel that keeps service costs high because Americans should be able to choose the doctors they want and the care they need. I also favor doing away with the patent system for drugs an unnecessary government-granted monopoly that abuses people in need of care and fattens Big Pharma.  Under what circumstances should abortion be allowed?  I agree with the Supreme Court when it says that women should be free to choose prior to viability and that States are within their rights to restrict abortion after viability. I also believe exceptions need to be in place for cases of rape incest or if the life of the mother is endangered. I support the Casey decision (in Planned Parenthood vs Casey). I strongly object to Republicans who charge other parties of supporting ""infanticide"". They stoop low to rally their sensitive voters who don't have time to research the facts. In reality no one supports ""infanticide"" the killing of a live healthy breathing baby. I object strongly to the exploitation of this issue as a ""get out the vote"" tactic. The bullying candidates of the far right alone are responsible. Campaigns should not descend into shameless fear-mongering and incivility.  What role should government play in boosting the economy?  In Congress I would oppose all stimulus spending. I will work for fairness in business competition and against the Federal government's insider game of picking winners and losers. Further I would require that all emergency measures taken for the sake of stimulating the economy or protecting national security track the benefits to insiders. I oppose hidden taxpayer liabilities that sneak into bills and increase our long-term debt burden. I support low corporate taxes across the board and leaving private savings to the private sector to promote economic growth. Our national security state is also picking winners and losers in worldwide economic competition. We will be net exporter of oil in 2020. There is no reason for further oil wars. I oppose the use of war sanctions in peacetime. I support limiting the military's adverse effects on the world economy. I want to stop its destruction of lives property and the environment. War should be bad for business not good for business.  What changes should be made to the tax code?  Many libertarians believe that taxation is theft. The income tax is worse than theft since it is a tool of political power that targets individuals and movements. Financial surveillance on this scale has no place in a free society. I support abolition of the income tax. I view other taxes as fees charged for services. People should object to taxes and fees when the service is poor and the cost is high. Businesses that rip people off like that would not survive. To reduce spending and the size of government we have to return many government services to private hands. There is no better means of cost control than for consumers to demand better services from private managers not public administrators. Most government enterprises can't match the competitive private sector for quality. My written proposals for privatizing Veterans health care and the student lending system is the best way to reform those two poor-performing agencies.  What is the best way to bring down unemployment?  I oppose direct interference in the job market by the Federal government. Republicans complained that the Obama administration spent nearly a million dollars for every $50000 annual salary job he created or preserved. Who knows how much Trump is spending per job to boost his employment numbers? Republicans won't say but it's probably higher than what Obama spent. The Feds cannot pick winners and losers in business or labor. Favoring one group of job holders hurts another. Private capital builds job markets. I will fight to end manipulation of savings rates to very low levels enabling the government to borrow more that it ever could if it faced real market rates. A low or negative interest rate policy will destroy private savings. We should increase not decrease incentives for savers to accumulate real savings for their businesses and retirement. We cannot burden future generations with unmanageable debt. I strongly support automatic fiscal constraints when budgets are not balanced.  How would you guarantee Social Security benefits for future generations?  Social Security has been so poorly managed by Congress that it won't be financially viable by the time our youngest workers are ready for retirement. Our options are limited to raising contributions from taxpayers borrowing money or lowering benefits. I oppose higher taxes further indebtedness and undue burdens on young workers. As a financial professional I have a duty to protect the elderly who have already paid into the system. The benefit formula must reflect the reality that we are living and working longer. We can improve our prospects by allowing more immigration and getting life-extending treatments to market faster. With more young people longer work lives good economic growth adjustments to the benefit formula and market-based interest rates we can have a sustainable system. If Congress doesn't improve its own ability to cooperate the program will ultimately fail.  Is there anything else you would like voters to know about you?  The two major party candidates have both failed in this special election cycle to sit before an adversarial audience and take questions. Both take big money from out of state donors who expect favors in return. My campaign receives small individual donations and we have no corporate sponsors. The bitter partisan fighting we hear everyday drowns out calm consideration of the issues. We can't let bullying political parties bury the truth about what everyday Americans need from their lawmakers. As a Libertarian I will stand outside the swamp to bring professionalism and sanity the U.S. House of Representatives on behalf of the people of North Carolina. You have a rare opportunity support a moderate independent even-tempered candidate for this office. I ask for your vote on September 10.",political,Facebook
"This is a compelling testimony delivered by Billys closest former staff at Devereux Jessica Gustafson Subject: Fwd: Billy Cray's Bill   IMG_2549.HEIC  IMG_2549.HEIC  Begin forwarded message: Subject: Fwd: Billy Cray's Law  IMG_2549.HEIC -------- Original IMG_2549.HEIC  Dear Chairwoman Downey and members of the Assembly Human Services Committe  My name is Jessica Gustafson. I am a former employee of Devereux. I was employed there for almost two years. Most of those two years I worked at the Euclid home located in Somers Point NJ. Euclid is were I meant William ""Billy"" Cray but this was not the first time I heard of him. During orientation we were warned about Billy. The told us that he was aggressive and often lied about being abused by staff. I was so nervous walking through the front door of Euclid for the first time based of what I was told. It was about a month in that I started to realize the truth. Billy was not this monster they made us believe he was and he definitely was not a lair. The abuse was real. Instead of warning staff Devereux should have been warning Billy's parents about the treatment he received under their care. The Cray's made the decision to place their son at with Devereux believing it was in his best interest. Unfortunately that was not the case and we are all here now trying to help pass Billy Cray's Law(Assembly Bill 4013). Billy was often the center of abuse not just physically but also mentally. He was viewed and treated differently because in my opinion he could tell the truth and no one wanted to take it serious. For an example when another client was in the hospital Devereux sent out an email to all staff in the area encouraging us to go visit him. When Billy was at Ancora I went with my supervisor to visit him. I need to stress the fact it was not on company time. Both myself and my supervisor received phone calls telling us that we were not allowed to visit Billy again. Billy was not clumsily or accident prone but he would regularly come home from the day prog with at least one new bruise set times a week. I once walked in on an employee holding Billy's face down on a couch. When I tried to tell someone I was told it was in fact Billy's doing. One morning most of Euclid staff was at the house for a staff meeting. We all came in to see a hole in the wall. We were told there was an incident with Billy and he had punced the wall. That was a great story but not the truth by any means. You see the hole was huge. I stated the fact the story did not add up and one could clearly see it was a body that made the hole. I was told to shut up because they higher ups were there. The whole was so big that when it was time for state inspection the whole was covered with a picture that took up the whole wall. Reporting abuse was frowned upon by Devereux and if they found out you could lose your job. I wish I did report it to the state and I will regret not doing so forever but I needed my job just like others employed there. It was maybe four or five month before Billy's death that I received pictures via text of Billy and his body covered in bruised. Since I no longer feared losing my job I called the state of NJ. I was pressured to give my information which at this point I could careless who knew I called. I could maybe right my wrong for not calling before. To describe the pictures I received to someone I would say it looked like Billy was being initiated into a gang. It broke my heart but not as much when I received the phone call that Billy had passed. The first words out of my mouth was they killed him and in my heart I still believe that. While i will never know exactly happens that dreadful day I do know had their been cameras in the home it could have been prevented or at the very least give his parents the answers to their questions! Cameras should be installed in every hospital  nursing and group home in America. While abuse may never go away completely cameras would definitely decrease the amount of abuse. The men and women that have to leave in a group home as the right to feel safe and not fear being abuse. We go into their homes to work and our privacy should be the least of anyone's worries. In my opinion the only reason an employee would object to cameras is because they have something to hide. I am begging you to please pass this law in Billy's name to stop the next death!!  Thank you Jessica Gustafson   Sent from my Verizon Samsung Galaxy smartphone",political,Facebook
Introducing the DemRep Towel!  Get it right each time. One side for your face and one for your backside. You choose what side.  Never make the mistake of using the wrong side of the towel again!  With the state of our current political landscape it is no secret that the secret to politics is to have a deep sense of humor! Whether one is Democrat or one is Republican its all fair sport. So we came up with a brilliant idea! If you have a particular political party that you lean towards you can now participate anonymously in the 'game'.  Now in the privacy of your bathroom you can decide what political party gets your vote by what part of the anatomy the side of the towel they are on wipes dry. In other words wipe your face with your favorite party and let the opposing political party have the honor of wiping the bottom end of things.

Med. line- I did that article the other day regarding the price of medications but have you ever asked yourself why they are so much cheaper in Canada? International drug companies realize that other countries have different scales of economy which means that they are not as rich as we are and could never afford their drug unless they lowered the sales price. So what they did is lower the price to accommodate them but in doing so in order to preserve their bottom line they raised ours because we can afford it. It has nothing to do with the true cost of the drug which includes research and development. In other words they make us pay for their drugs once more becoming the piggy-bank for the world and you wonder why also your insurance premiums are so high. Also drug companies can pay pharmacies to get our prescription records so as to know how to better sell drugs to us. A clear violation of the doctors and patients rights but the pharmacists benefit greatly. Our drug prices are high for many reasons and will continue unless something is done. I wish that a attorney would come forward and lead a class action against drug companies and pharmacies regarding violating our patients and the doctors privacy rights in the local pharmacies to better sell them. We didnt give them permission to do it! At least I dont remember doing it!!,political,Facebook

We are all in this together. As I stood in line waiting to be verified and given my ballot...I thought of the history...the sacrifices...the honor it was that a person like me would even have a say in the future of our nation. The ballot was handed to me along with advice on how to fill it out...I walked over to one of the dozen or so voting booths with the red white & blue curtains surrounding you for privacy. Names you heard everyday in the news and in political ads jumped out and I thought...this really is it...this is where I count! At the top...Pick one - President of the United States...it all hit home. I knew weeks ago who I wanted to fill the next four years...but was it right...should I change my mind...I paused...said a short prayer...looked at the choices again...my pen went to paper...the circle is filled.

8 Reasons to Purchase Thuja Green Giant Trees  1. Fast Grower The Thuja Green Giant is one of the fastest growing trees in America. It grows 1 to 3 feet per year. The Arborvitae tree can grow up to 60 feet tall with a 12 to 20-foot spread at maturity. 2. Privacy The Thuja Green Giant is extremely popular in large part because a lot of people use it as a fence around their backyard. It's significantly more affordable efficient and effective to use these trees instead of an actual fence. 3. They're Beautiful The Thuja Green Giant Arborvitae is a genuine evergreen tree. They don't turn different colors in different seasons. The beautiful pictures speak for themselves. 4. Extremely Tough - Resistant To Disease Pest Deer Drought The Thuja Green Giant Arborvitae trees are extremely tough and don't die easily. They are resistant to major pests and diseases. Even bagworms generally leave them alone. Deer don't bother these trees either. They can also withstand drought and most kinds of weather (as explained below). Few people have serious problems with them and you can expect them to remain healthy for decades. 5. They Can Grow in Most Of America They can grow in USDA zones 5 to 9 which is the overwhelming majority of the continental United States. Locally it covers almost the entire state of Virginia West Virginia and Maryland. It can generally withstand snow ice heavy rain wind intense heat and humidity. 6. Tolerant of Many Different Soils They will generally grow well in sand clay loam silt and even wet soil. 7. Easy to Trim & Shape These are low maintenance trees. You can trim and shape them once a year. Additionally there are no sharp needles to deal with. 8. Shade Tolerant They can grow well in areas that are shady 50 percent of the day or with dappled shade. The growth will only slow in heavy shade. Shade from other trees will not have much of an impact because the light is not filtered by passing through of leaves of other trees.,political,Facebook
On Mass  School Shootings  Recently the New Orleans Mayor said ending violence will not be easy or quick. It's generational! She is right and we must start now. Fundamentally Its values. We do not value life as we used to. It isn't a simple solution or set of events that drive a person to mass violence at a school shopping mall or place of worship. But research does indicate common characteristics of those who have committed these acts. We need to eliminate and address these characteristics.  There is a high probability that people who do these shootings have been subjected to or seen violence when they are young. We need to care for our children when they are very young. We need to protect and care for children who may be in households where there is physical and emotional abuse. We need to be vigilant for violence in the community and at school such as bullying. We need ways to identify those children and families at risk and provide support when needed so we don't end with the damaged children and adults. This cuts across all races ethnicities and income levels. If we don't address this we will end up with damaged teens and adults.  Each of them has suffered a personal crisis. We need to be sure people can handle and adapt to those personal crises we all experience. Whether its personal rejection discipline from a parent or employer or losing a job our children need to be raised to be resilient so they can withstand these personal setbacks. All people need support networks to help them through these times. Whether the support is from their family or faith or a social support system people need to be able to handle these personal crises.  Finally for some reason these people damaged from experiencing childhood violence and suffering a personal crisis to often come up with a plan giving them satisfaction by committing the despicable act of violence. They have an idea access to the tools so they can carry out their plan and a susceptible/easy target. We cannot change the way people think but we must secure the tools they can use. And when it is reasonable we need to defend what may be easy or soft targets. I do not want to live in a police state that searches everyone when entering a building. I don't want to live in a country where everyone is always on camera. I treasure my privacy. We could quickly lose our freedom. If we ban the tools (guns) most have used we likewise will be losing our freedom.  The answer is not easy or quick. Its generational! We need to eliminate children suffering or seeing violence when they are young and most impressionable. We need to detect and support those having a personal crisis. We need to do these things so we dont have broken people going through life. And we need to harden targets where we can and must keep guns and other weapons out of the hands of those who should not have them. That is our challenge and our responsibility.  If this makes sense to you. Please follow this page and like this site so you will see my upcoming posts on issues facing our nation and the 20th Congressional District. Please engage in this discussion. We will all learn. I ask that you be respectful and remember everyone is entitled to their point of view. Finally stay engaged be sure to register to vote and VOTE in the Primary and General Election in November.,political,Facebook
Some might be puzzled at the 3 words Ive used to describe myself on campaign literature. English is a complex language and it often leaves chances for mis-perceptions. I want to address what I mean when I use these words.  Christian: I am a follower of the Lord Jesus. I am a follower precisely because I need a savior. Im NOT a follower because I am perfect. I am FAR from perfect I am thankful for His grace and always hopeful for His mercy. I am a sinner saved by Grace This moniker has nothing to do with me looking down on or condemning those who dont agree with me. I am for the record thankful we live in a country where we can all follow our own hearts faiths and even religions. I am a follower of Christ and that comes with a big responsibility---to love my neighbor as myself to be kind to be reminded that I need to have on display the fruit of the Spirit in my life (love joy peace patience kindness gentleness humility and self-control). I have that label on my material primarily for me---to remind ME that my life is on display and to never do harm to the name of the one I follow  Conservative: Modern conservatism is rooted in respect for American traditions including federalism support for a business-friendly environment where people can find jobs individual liberties and responsibilities. As a conservative I believe in American exceptionalism and I believe the solution for Louisiana is to get government out of the way and unleash the creative and entrepreneurial spirit of our people! Louisianans believe that people should be empowered and aided by the government not held down and suppressed by government. As a conservative I believe people know how to spend their money better than government and I believe that we need a smaller and more efficient government and a stronger private sector that employs our people.  Republican: The Grand Old Party (GOP) is the logical home for a person who is pro-life and pro individual liberties. The other national party simply does not welcome people like me who believe in the rights of unborn nor do they embrace those of us who will ardently support your rights to self-defense (Second Amendment) and the entire Constitution. The Republican Party is the home of those who want to keep our nation sovereign and our borders protected. I believe if our nation is sovereign we in Louisiana have a better chance of running our State the way we see fit. You wont find Republicans espousing things like getting rid of the Electoral College or rolling back your rights to privacy. The GOP is the place where the values of security privacy and protection of the innocent have a home.,political,Facebook
Good Morning  On June 12 the Colorado General Assembly passed SB-217 Governor Polis signed this bill into effect yesterday.  I support this bill and the changes that it makes. This bill is intended to make police departments more accountable to the public with larger safeguards in place. The vast majority of police officers are good people doing a very tough job making split second life-or-death decisions. For these officers the contents of this bill will have very little effect on them. This bill will help to support those officers by highlighting the good deeds that they do day in and day out.  This bill is not exceptionally demanding of the police and it requires the following changes: -mandatory body cameras on all officers by 2023 -a clear path for body camera footage being made public by the police departments. -clear privacy protections in place to prevent the dissemination of personal information of any victims family of victims and officers unrelated to the incident in review. -division of criminal justice in the department of public safety to create an annual report. -A requirement that each state and local agency that employs peace officers shall report to the attorney general: -All use of force by its officers that results in death or serious bodily injury; -All instances when an officer resigned while under investigation for violating department policy; -All data relating to stops conducted by its peace officers; and -All data related to the use of an unannounced entry by a peace officer -termination and revocation of credentials for any peace officer found guilty of inappropriate use of force. -a statewide database tracking these terminations -removal of qualified immunity and a defendant's good faith but erroneous belief in the lawfulness of his or her conduct are not defenses to the civil action. -repeals a peace officer's authority to use a choke-hold.  This bill does not make the use of deadly force illegal but instead strengthens language that limits the use of deadly physical force to only situations when necessary to effect an arrest prevent escape from custody when the person is using a deadly weapon themselves or is likely to imminently cause danger to life or serious bodily injury.  As mentioned above I support this bill and all the changes within it.  This bill was passed by the Colorado House over a NO vote by my opponent Perry Will. Unsurprisingly Mr. Will has not made any public statement as to why he does not wish to support protections for citizens and the vast majority of good officers. I am not surprised by this as Mr. Will does not speak to the public about his representation of them he simply votes along party lines. A leader speaks explains and listens to the needs of his constituents. Mr. Will is not the leader we deserve.  Thank you  Colin J. Wilhelm,political,Facebook
"We have quite a few high school and college interns working on our campaign (you can sign up too at www.eladgross.org/intern).  Yesterday I was scheduled to talk to a student who had some questions about the campaign. He's Republican and was planning on interning with our current Attorney General's campaign. But he heard about me he liked what I was saying and he wanted to know where I stood on a variety of issues.  We talked for 47 minutes. I asked maybe two questions that entire time. This was his interview of me.  We didn't agree on everything. He does not support abortion. We talked a lot about privacy rights the underpinnings of personal freedom the tragic history of government intervention in medical decisions. He wanted to know my stance on guns. I talked about the training I've gone through how Missouri used to require training to carry concealed but doesn't anymore how there's a big difference between growing up respecting guns and buying a handgun when you're a teenager without any training because you fear for your life and how we can get together from across the political spectrum to take on violent crime. We talked about the economy why I want to start Missouri's first Civil Rights Division how the office works. We talked about why I like working with folks I don't always agree with.  But most importantly we talked about his community service how he'll be spending his summer helping folks in need of food how involved he is at his church.  At the end of the conversation I asked him how I did and whether he wanted to work with me.  He said ""Do you have debates with the Attorney General?"" ""I hope so."" ""I can be your practice partner.""  This is how we take back Missouri.",political,Facebook
During our four years in Augusta Congressman Jared Golden and I were on the opposite ends of many crucial issues.  GUN RIGHTS  I sponsored and passed Constitutional Carry to ensure our right to keep and bear arms without a government permission slip. Meanwhile Golden voted against Constitutional Carry three times voting to disarm Maine people and keep us defenseless.  WELFARE REFORM  As Senate Chairman for the Health and Human Services Committee I negotiated Welfare Reform prohibiting the purchase of alcohol cigarettes and lottery tickets with welfare dollars. Golden voted to allow these abusive purchases to continue and to expand welfare for non-citizens.  HEALTHCARE FREEDOM  I spearheaded the effort for Right to Try allowing terminally ill Maine people to try potentially life-saving investigational medicines that haven't completed the FDA approval process. Golden sided with Washington bureaucrats against sick Maine people voting against Right to Try.  RIGHT TO LIFE  I co-sponsored legislation to require parental consent for underage abortions and argued for it on the floor of the Maine Senate. Golden voted to allow minors to undergo abortion procedures without any input from their parents.   But Jared's record of depriving Maine people of our freedoms and our paychecks did not end in Augusta. He continues supporting an anti-freedom agenda in Washington DC.  GOVERNMENT SPYING  I sponsored the 4th Amendment Protection Act in the Maine Senate to oppose Washington DC's warrantless spying on the American people through our digital devices. Jared Golden however recently voted to renew the PATIOT Act to continue these unconstitutional infringements on American privacy rights.  CORPORATE WELFARE  I stood alone in the Maine Senate against Corporate Welfare like the Maine Capital Investment Fund a state level corporate welfare program that gives taxpayer-financed sweetheart loans to well-connected big businesses. Not only did Jared Golden vote for this corporate welfare program on the state level he just voted to support the Export-Import Bank a federal corporate welfare program that does exactly the same thing  just on a more massive scale with billions in our taxpayer money.  ENDLESS WAR  Our troops have been thrown into two decades of undeclared war in the Middle East with no end in sight. Our veterans overwhelmingly say its time to come home and I agree with them. But Jared Golden has opposed President Trump's efforts to bring our troops home from Syria and Afghanistan wanting to keep our soldiers fighting for a third decade with no clear mission.  I'm not saying Jared Golden is a bad guy. I'm just saying that he consistently votes to steal our freedoms and paychecks while growing government power.  We deserve a Congressman who will fight for a #FreeMaine and a #FreeAmerica. That's why I am running for Congress.,political,Facebook
A strong relationship between a prosecutors office and law enforcement includes having respect for each others job. When we see dismissals because of Criminal Rule 4(c) reasons it is evidence of the prosecutors office dropping the ball and demonstrates a level of disrespect for the time our officers put into their jobs.  Here is that list of cases that have been dismissed over the last 4-5 years because of Criminal Rule 4(C) issues or rather a failure to prosecute:  75C01-1612-F2-000005 Dealing in Methamphetamine Possession of Methamphetamine Maintaining a Common Nuisance 75C01-1612-F4-000009 Dealing in Methamphetamine Possession of Methamphetamine Maintaining a Common Nuisance 75C01-1608-F5-000047 Neglect of a Dependent Resulting in Bodily Injury 75C01-1608-F6-000150 Maintaining a Common Nuisance 75C01-1606-F6-000004 Intimidation 75C01-1605-F5-000026 Operating a Motor Vehicle after a Lifetime Forfeiture 75C01-1603-F5-000008 Dealing in a Synthetic Drug Possession of Methamphetamine Maintaining a Common Nuisance 75C01-1509-F6-000107 Maintaining a Common Nuisance Possession of Methamphetamine Possession of Precursors 75C01-1512-F6-000154 Dealing in a Controlled Substance Maintaining a Common Nuisance 75C01-1507-F5-000032 Criminal Mischief 75C01-1506-F6-000059 Operating a Vehicle While Intoxicated 75C01-1506-F6-000058 Counterfeiting 75C01-1405-FD-000075 Attempted Invasion of Privacy (with a Prior) 75C01-1311-FD-000217 Theft Receipt of Stolen Property 75C01-1305-FD-000077 Habittual Traffic Violator 75C01-1303-FD-000048 Operating a Vehicle While Intoxicated  Our officers deserve better and deserve more respect for the work they put into their jobs. Failing to prosecute a case should not happen. We should not waste our resources in this manner.  In November vote for a more efficient and effective Prosecutor who respects the time and effort of our Officers.,political,Facebook
A RIGHT TO INTERNAL SELF DETERMINATION the sure way to uproot political cultism GETTING RID OF MUSEVENISM (Joseph Kabuletas Weekly Rant)  Last week I watched one interview on NTV and read another in the Daily Monitor and it dawned on me (all over again) how difficult it will be to root out Musevenism when its patron is gone.  Forget about the man at the top he is the easier one to dump. But the deeply-embedded culture of privilege and licentiousness that has burgeoned under him and spread its roots across the civil service and all arms of government; that will take some uprooting.  Keith Muhakanizi has served in diverse economic advisory roles in the Ministry of Finance or Economic Planning from the 1980s and is now the Permanent Secretary/Secretary to the Treasury a position hes held since 2013. He is also the man who signed away $379m to an Italian investor to build a 264-bed specialized hospital which will be operated as a world-class internationally accredited facility to treat conditions for which Ugandans have been travelling abroad blah blah Thats the official dross.  Then there is the skullduggery; the openly flouted PPP rules the fact that a contract was signed with the investor before Parliament approved and all the drama weve come to expect. Of course we know it was a heist. The money will not all be used for a hospital definitely not all of it in fact we shall be lucky if any hospital is built.  But thats not what got my blood boiling. As Ugandans who have lived through the NRM revolution we have been sufficiently desensitized to financial scandal. Its possible even likely that the fake investor deal was hatched by forces above Muhakanizi when he was abroad getting treatment. So his lack of answers didnt upset me either I expected it.  What I found infuriating was his attitude in that interview with NTVs Emma Mutayizibwa. It was by all means the most pulse-stilling exchange I have ever watched.  Like all Musevenis toadies Muhakanizi is choking on privilege and a deep sense of entitlement. He barely let the interviewer complete any questions before shooting back with smug and patronizing answers typical of that from 1986 generation. Young man listen to me he shouted screwing his face and rolling his eyes in their socket like his master acting like being tasked to answer questions on the use or abuse of government funds is an intrusion into his privacy way up there with asking about his sex life.  Government heists happen all over the world. Nothing new about that. But the people at the heart of it often have the courtesy as it were of pretending to be accountable. Their explanations are nothing more than vague rationalizations platitudes and prosaicisms which never convince anyone but at least they maintain a semblance obligation. But what good ol Keith did is the verbal equivalent of sticking out the middle finger to Ugandans who dont belong in his privileged group. Even people who visit brothels have enough chivalry to leave a note on the table. Just because its dirty business doesnt mean it cannot be done with a measure of courtesy.  The second interview came in a story on a report that showed that poverty levels have increased across the country. Ugandan youth dont need a study to tell them as much most of them are witnesses in the first degree.  But then some bloke called Mondo Kyateka the Commissioner of Youth and Children Affairs at the Ministry of Gender speaking from the comfort of his air-conditioned office gave his two-pence worth of whatever it was (the word wisdom would be an incongruity). I have seen women as early as 6:00am carrying baskets of merchandise. There is work to do. There is a lot of land to till. When I was young people would go to work in the morning come for lunch and go back to dig and return in the evening. People have become lazy because of entitlement mentality that someone must give especially the youth.  Now that is rich. His advice for unemployed youth roaming the streets with their papers is they should go and dig from morning to evening and carry merchandize on your heads to the market. Thats the voice of a true NRM cadre in whom there is no guile.Thats exactly the kind of advice the youth would get from the president himself.  In 1986 (Oh Lord I am beginning to sound like them). Ok in 1986 Ugandas biggest imports were tracks and vans ($14.3m) food processing machinery ($8.6m) textile machinery construction machinery and mechanized farm equipment. Coffee processors were also high up there. Rural Uganda was healthy and booming. They grew coffee dried it processed it and trusted government through its parastatal Coffee Marketing Board to market the product. The system was functional. Villagers were prosperous. They were not asking for handouts. On the contrary they were giving handouts to ragtag rebel soldiers who promised them a new level of bliss if they took government.  In 2016 three decades after those rebels took power the president went around villages distributing hoes to the same rural people who were engaged in mechanized agriculture before he became president. Also in 2016 the president in his Bosco hat demonstrably introduced villagers to the wonders of bicycle irrigation. In 1986 they were importing water trucks and vans to transport produce thirty years later they are fetching water on bicycles. Thats the grim reality of the NRM revolution.  Musevenism is that snobbish and arrivalist attitude that makes state functionaries believe that they are entitled to regal comfort while blaming the victims of the NRM mess for their own misery. It is that self-important brashness so aptly personified by Keith Muhakanizi and Mondo Kyateka. It is a Machiavellian approach where people are deliberately stripped of all their self-belief self-worth and tools of production and are made dependent on State handouts. Thats how politicians entrench themselves in power.  So its no surprise that the rural people who were stripped of their dignity are the ones running to the bully for hoes in exchange of votes. Neither is it a surprise that they are the ones that vote for him. As long as he keeps them poor they will keep him in power. Neither is it a surprise that people in the inner circle like Muhakanizi feel inconvenienced by simple procedural questions and expect exploited Ugandans to cheer their exploiters.  How do we roll back all this society damage?  How do we roll back the years to the days when a president couldnt appoint his wife and his concubines to ministerial positions and Ugandans let it pass?  How shall we teach our people that national resources belong to Ugandans and not to one family and its clingers-on?  How shall we get back to the days when civil servants were actually servants not masters?  Getting rid of Museveni is the easier part of this equation. Getting rid of Musevenism will require a counter revolution.,political,Facebook

WHAT I STAND FOR  It is a universal principle that a home cannot be built on a foundation of sand. We must take that idea and apply it to Government in a few key areas. Below are the things that I will be standing and working for as Governor of Wisconsin.   Balanced Budget and Building a Wisconsin Rainy Day Fund   State Food Independence/Security and Economic Opportunities for Rural Wisconsin   Shrink the size of Government | Trim the Fat | Return Wealth back to the people.   Empower the Working Middle Class to Build More Savings   Empower the Welfare Dependent to become Independent and Working Again   Small Business Encouragement and Support   Education and Teachers - More focus on Entrepreneurship education and building businesses to create jobs for the future. - Returning more disciplinary power to teachers. - Elevate salaries for effective teachers producing quality students and future business owners.   No More Homelessness in our Cities - I am strongly empathetic to the homeless. I feel this is a disgrace to humanity to forget about our fellow man/woman/child if they are willing to become productive members of society again. This reflects poorly on all of us if we choose to ignore the issue.   Shutdown Milwaukee as a Hub for Sex Trafficking - There can never be a blessing from God when we tolerate crimes against children young people and adults. I will work hard to eradicate this epidemic.   Fully Support the 2nd Amendment and will NEVER Infringe on it.   Individual Rights | What happens in the privacy of your own home or establishment is your business not the Government's business.  Not bought off by campaign funding bribes from special interest groups. I will fight for freedom for Americans with every last ounce of strength that is within me.,political,Facebook

Serving as your Register of Deeds The office of the Register of Deeds represents a cornerstone of our economy. In the 8 years that I have served as your Grafton County Register of Deeds I have witnessed a very strong recovery of our real estate market. As I took office the country and the county were still feeling the effects of the financial crisis. Foreclosure rates peaked at 170 per year down now to 50 per year. Simultaneously the threat of further reduction in property values was almost inevitable when faced with the widespread destruction that would have been inflicted by Northern Pass. Many good and dedicated people of vision came together to help our county thrive. I speak my mind I am independent and not beholding to any industry commission or party. I do not solicit political donations and have a long history of speaking out on campaign finance reform. I garner my base of support one phone call at a time one frustrated property owner at a time. You can read more about me and my accomplishments at You may question the reasons for my actions as an elected official but please never question my patriotism. I spent a great deal of time last year working on family genealogy and hope to soon be admitted to the Plymouth chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. My family has fought for our country since the beginning. I testified to the NH House on the actions that sovereign citizens were taking by filing false liens on the property of unsuspecting citizens and public officials. My testimony helped convince the committee to draft law making our state the first in the nation where this action is considered a felony on the first offense. I strove to achieve balance between access to the Official Public Record and privacy concerns in the age of the internet. You do not hear a great deal about the office of Grafton County Register of Deeds that is simply because it worksseamlessly. The dedication of my team is remarkable they are committed to problem solving for the public good. I seek innovation and creative ways of assisting our municipalities with the ability that only we possess. We are the sole source of this data reports generated from our offices to NH DRA have allowed for the creation of the very successful equalization program which NH DRA uses to set tax rates. Aggregation of the data is most valuable so much so that the last 4 years have seen constant efforts in our legislature to erode our role and hand it over to privatization. It is my efforts on a national level and my consistent persuasive testimony in Concord that has inspired my peers to nominate me as the Vice President of the NH Register of Deeds Association for the coming biennium. The founders of our great state placed such value on the ability to properly identify ownership and interest in real property that they embedded the office in the NH Constitution. I have been your gatekeeper for these very challenging 8 years and with your support I will continue to keep watch and act to protect this basic function of government by keeping it locally controlled. No one can equal my dedication and passion for this office and I respectfully request the honor of your vote on November 6 2018.,political,Facebook
Someone was asking about where I stood on mandates for the covid vaccine in our schools. I thought this is a perspective that people have a right to know about. I love this vaccine. I couldn't wait to get it and got my child vaccinated as soon as we could. However I don't believe my personal feelings about the vaccine should ever infringe on you making your own choices for you and your family. Row v Wade gave us all the right to medical privacy. I would much rather make my husband (a pharmacist who is one of the people tasked with the vaccine roll out for MDI and who helped write policy on how to handle pandemics under president Obama) available to answer any and all questions you might have about the vaccine. I want you to want this for yourself. I will make sure you have all the scientific information. And I will respect your privacy no matter what you choose to do. I believe in my body my choice and plan to stand by that.,political,Facebook
We at The Brotherhood/Sister Sol (Bro/Sis) vehemently oppose the expansion of the New York Police Department (NYPD) by way of Youth Coordination Officers. Young people need more social workers therapists guidance counselors and other student support staffnot more police.  The NYPD has announced expanded tracking and surveillance as a part of this program - this is a discredited approach and an invasion of privacy - our children do not need to be surveilled. The NYPD does not belong in our schools in its current role - let alone as counselors for our children. Ill-equipped to help students navigate the varied issues they face the only role of the 300 Youth Coordination Officers is to further police and criminalize our youth and to advance the sharing of information on an already over-policed population. Monies spent on these officers would be better spent in our education system supporting the mental health educational advancement and overall wellbeing of New York City students.  It is imperative that our city limits the power of the NYPD and empowers other entities better able to address the needs of our city's most marginalized and vulnerable. Policing in schools and the policing of students in particular is not a solution.  The job of rehabilitation and coordination of support for young people for anybody is not that of the NYPD. It never will be. To end the school to prison pipeline we must divest from the NYPD and systems of both mass-criminalization and mass-incarceration. To truly support youth we must invest in people by bettering our schools and building our communities.  #CounselorsNotCops  NYPD,political,Facebook
To Whom it May Concern:  Im an AP teacher at the High School. When schools closed in March and we all went home my colleagues and I worked really hard to develop the very best materials we could to help deliver instruction. Our resources grew over time as did our skills at utilizing them. It was a whole new world. I was fortunate to have some experience with the digital tools I needed but for many teachers it was a struggle: trying to learn new software raising their own children and sorting through the overload of information that came to us each day. While I know that not all parents were happy with what their children experienced I hope that they know we were working hard and doing our best.  As we began discussions with the district about what the Fall would look like I was encouraged by the cooperative approach taken by the Assistant Superintendent for Curriculum and Instruction who chaired our committee. Together with teacher representatives from all levels Department Directors and Building Principals we began to reimagine what our schools could be. We did not at the time know what message the Governor would give about whether schools would be open in September so our task was multifaceted.  In the case where schools were to remain closed we quickly came up with a 100% Remote Learning plan that would simulate a school-day. There would be (asynchronous) pre-recorded lessons that students could view (and re-view as needed) there would be (synchronous) live lessons where teachers could work with the whole class and/or with small groups of students and there would be times for individual students and teachers to connect in an office hours model. Is remote learning ideal? Of course not. We were however sure that we would be able to provide a quality education with the students as active learners.  There are of course MANY problems with returning to our school buildings during this pandemic. Unfortunately this took up a lot of time and energy at our meetings. There are so very many questions: Could we clean shared spaces frequently enough? How could kids safely use the restrooms? How could we maintain social distancing in the hallways? What is a mask break and how can we do them safely? What does art look like with no shared materials? How long will it take for a kindergarten class to all wash their hands before and after lunch? And so on... There are no easy answers. It became apparent that the district would be able to maintain only the minimum health and safety standards put out by the State Departments of Health and Education. There will still be serious risk of spreading the virus in every scenario.  With the health risks always on our minds the committee members put our heads together (with masks and social distance of course) to come up with an in-person plan. We had the basics figured out pretty well:  - K-3 needed special consideration so we drafted a plan that would utilize as much available staff and space to get them all in classes with teachers all day. Specials could push-in to the classroom to minimize the childrens exposure to other groups of students.  - Grades 4-5 are a little bit more independent so our plan put them with their teacher for half the day in AM/PM groups. (By using so much staff and space for K-3 we were limited for the rest of the elementary grades.) The other half of the day would be specials and TA led reinforcement.  - Secondary was a little more complex to figure out. The space available would limit the capacity. Wed have to split the students and have only half of them in the building at any given time. Middle School grades can be cohorted so that they dont change classrooms more than a couple of times each day. But at the High School student schedules are so unique that this would not be possible. We did not want to eliminate the many wonderful educational opportunities that our elective programs offer so we had to think really hard about what we could do. We drew inspiration from the Flipped Classroom model. It has been catching on around the world over the years. In this model the students view pre-recorded lessons and material at home and the in-class time is used to reinforce clarify apply discuss and assess. This model would allow us to shorten the class periods (to help with longer transportation times longer class change times and more preparation time) keep the students as active learners and still provide a quality education. To be honest this plan terrified me. While I was (and am still) convinced that it would be best for students education it would be A LOT of work for teachers. I was not looking forward to the workload or to convincing my colleagues that it would be worth it.  And thats where our committee last stood. We had some great concepts but still needed to negotiate many details to make it work. The main obstacles to overcome were providing adequate time for teacher preparation and figuring out how to maintain a sanitary environment for everyone. We had not yet discussed creating a remote-only option for families but we had floated the idea of matching those students with teachers to create such a system. The committee scheduled a meeting to continue our discussions.  In the week that elapsed before the next meeting was to occur the Superintendent threw away our collaborative work and published her own plan. Her plan calls for live-streaming lessons from the secondary classroom for every teacher and class. Instead of the flipped classroom concept this would revert all secondary teachers to the old chalk and talk approach that is widely viewed as archaic and less effective. In the Superintendents model students would be able to attend the class from home but ALL STUDENTS would be passive learners. This plan provides very limited time for teachers to interact with at-home students. Students not present in the classroom will only be able to ask questions via email (which would be answered within 48 hours) and extra help would be during a teachers professional period. If a student has another class scheduled during the professional period then such extra help would not be possible for him or her.  If we broadcast our classrooms live as the Superintendent demands we face a multitude of problems for the childrens education:  - Participation in class would not be possible for any at-home students (this includes HALF of the student population on any day as well as all remote-only students).  - Participation in class would be hindered for in-class students because theyll know that they are being recorded and broadcast.  - Privacy of IEP students 504 students and any other students with special accommodations would be in jeopardy.  - Lessons will be stilted: canned scripts will be chosen by teachers for fear of saying the wrong thing while parents are watching.  - If a teacher is absent there will be no lesson to broadcast but attendance would still be mandatory for students. Extra Help will be the only time for at-home students to interact with the teacher. (Remember: half the students are at-home every day.)  - Students opting for remote-only will not be able to view lessons/materials on their own schedule.  I have endeavored thus far to stay focused on the education of the students. I have not yet delved into the many other problems that the Superintendents live-streaming plan presents. I hope that you realize that even though I am a union officer my first thoughts are of the education of our children.  There are technology problems that will prevent the district from starting the school year on time or running successfully:  - The district does not have the equipment. What cameras are to be used? What microphones?  - The district does not have the staff. Do we have a new Director of Technology? The Technology staff is severely overwhelmed in a normal school year so how can they be expected to set up every classroom in such a short amount of time?  - Are Chromebooks available for all students that need them?  - Can the students at home actually SEE and HEAR the lesson as the teacher intends it?  There are real teacher fears:  - Are parents judging every word the teacher says?  - What if a teacher makes a mistake? Will he or she be publicly shamed?  - Are parents comparing a teachers 5th period lesson to his or her 1st period lesson?  - Are students misbehaving on camera in a way that reflects badly on the teacher?  - Is someone recording a lesson and stealing it?  - Is someone doctoring a recording of a lesson and publishing it to make the teacher or school look bad?  - Is someone using a recording of a teacher out of context in a way that makes the teacher or school look bad?  - Who owns recordings of a teacher?  - When are teachers going to be trained on any new equipment?  I mentioned that I was terrified of the plan that I helped to develop and that I supported but that was because I was going to have to work really hard and stretch my technological abilities to the max. Im terrified of the Superintendents plan for more serious reasons: I become very vulnerable. My livelihood is on the line AND IM NOT ABLE TO DO MY JOB TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY. While the Superintendents plan for live-streaming would be significantly less work for me than creating digital lessons every day it still scares me more. And for what? What is the benefit to students? I have yet to hear what they are.  In closing I am not looking for the district to definitively adopt one plan or another. I am looking for the district to come back to the table and develop a plan that works for everyone. I know that the district has the legal right to force live-streaming but if the Superintendent truly cares about educating our students she will come to the table and talk about this with the rest of the players: teachers TAs administrators custodial staff clerical staff food service staff etc. EVERYONE should be a part of the process. The Superintendents behavior is reprehensible and the Board of Education should find a way to get her out of our district so they can hire someone that cares about education and knows how to bring people together.

As an individual but perhaps more importantly as a parent of children in the Teaneck Public Schools I wanted to express my personal support to elect Yassine S. Elkaryani (Column 5) and to re-elect Martin Ramirez (Column 3) this upcoming election day Tuesday November 5th 2019. I feel that Yassine S. Elkaryani's energy and understanding of the digital climate our children are living on a daily basis is a needed perspective in the development of policies that protect our children's privacy yet allow them the room to grow. With Martin Ramirez I have gotten to know him over the past 10 months and he is dedicated to ensuring that our kids receive the best education possible with the resources we have. He and I have a very similar fiscal policy in that we don't believe in just throwing money at a problem we believe that the money needs to go to the right places.  Although this is my personal opinion I hope that you will take it under consideration and vote for #3 and #5 to make it easier remember #Ram #Elk in the voting booth. #TeaneckSchools are good schools and together with the right team we can make them even better so that every child can succeed to the best of their individual potential. #Vote #Nov5 #Teaneck #BOEMatters #TeaneckStudentsMatter #TeaneckKidsFirst,political,Facebook

"February 6 20/20 (1997 days of capture)  So far I have written down 78 addresses to forward to my lawyer DJ and its missing one and a half cute streets: Mimring and the other half of the red brick road (with blood) Como that isn't the ""government"" highway adjoining the properties to my own with an alley. Why such a large number you might be wondering? Well during one of my summer walks two years ago I could hear one of the many podcast meetings ABOUT me out of the various homes as I walked around my block. It was on Mimring that someone inside a white house said ""Oh no he's coming!"" and then a garage light flickered off and on as I walked by. So I don't know how far Jim the big cheese puff has spread the smear Rem campaign. It spread so far that a call was made to my employer Coldwell Banker with falsified information that resulted in me not being able to affiliate with them even though I had started the process 5 months earlier and was told ""No problem"" just 4 days prior to September 17 2019 that was the impetus to start typing my journal this page on Facebook.  I knew because such ridiculous crud was being believed that I had to get out the truth the words of my journal something that is meant to be private. Since my whole Wiggers Pawn experience has been public the only way my side the truth was going to be heard is if I put it into print and made it visible for people to absorb at their own pace and more importantly a place for all the evidence as I've included license plate numbers telephone numbers devices and IP addresses and much much more. It's a good thing the big cheese puff was so sure of himself for so long that my ""story"" was bull because now he finds out he's sticky and caught. Everything spun from the abdomen of a government spider admiring his quickly spun web addict-like in behavior making something out of nothing.  One of the biggest hurdles to overcome and bring into my captors' group conscience is a truth that my friend Paul Fogarty told me one day ""You can do drugs inside your home all day and the police can't do anything to you."" I pondered that statement and it was verified by my own teaching for a decade to 8th graders on the Bill of Rights ESPECIALLY as it relates to my own unique situation. The 4th amendment along with the right to privacy are huge freedoms we all as citizen of the United States are granted at birth and there would be no probable cause for the police or a government agency to do a legal search of my home. If by chance they did they would only find if anything at all an amount of substances resulting in the equivalent of a speeding ticket and a misdemeanor charge and to the shock of the neighborhood no jail time which means ""getting "" won't get him out of the neighborhood...like the Big Puff wants and likely promised everyone.  His belief in a con artist who I evicted from my home has him caught between a rock and a hard place. Do I enjoy doing drugs in my own home when I know somehow that my captors are aware of it (and alcohol is a drug)? Not really because a punishment of then scaring me and increasing the ringing in my ears and being kept up all night are among the ""techniques"" they use to ""cure"" me (get me to move out of the home I own). To get a warrant legally there would need to be three controlled purchases by undercover cops or informants in order for a judge to issue a warrant for a search and those individuals are by law obligated to disclose their undercover status if asked. It is however the only way I can move the ball further down the field since my team the Midgardians aren't willing to help kick it with me to restore my stolen freedoms. I suspect because they paid Jim to have me removed from the neighborhood under false pretense. That OR...it was all Jim's idea and he got everyone else caught up in his petty selfish desire to illegally discriminate against me for how I live my own life.  One scary truth that might be the case since being a TI (targeted individual) is that Scientology might not be involved at all (as my captors claim they are) or it could be both the government and the group. I suspect that sensors are between my 2nd and 3rd molars but since the bands to pull them out have been cut there is only elastic nubs between my teeth that feel like food particles and I can't get them out to stop the electronic harassment from occurring. On the other hand is it microwave energy weapons that when tuned I found out by researching online to a frequency between 420-450mhZ or 1.3gigihZ the technology is available for anyone to harass for the mere cost less than a brand new car. The good part about this scary truth is that Scarlar waves and Solfeggio energy can indeed be used as a defense against such unwanted attacks. So there is hope and not a reason to fear and the Devil my captors LOVE to feast on someone else's fear.  The other truth that I believe to be true is that a simple technology first developed by the Navy for navigation that was sold to the public through corporations is triangulation GPS. With this knowledge I have to believe that if satellite waves (also microwaves) are able to be plotted and tracked by a system that in fact is the same as v2k (voice to skull) and EH (electronic harassment) use as a crime that the government could if it tuned the frequencies to those broadbands would be able to identify the perps doing it. Yes voices do carry in the ravine but I'll be damned if they're going to carry inside my head!  I began reading June Ti's book: No Ordinary Stalking: a look at organized stalking and electronic harassment and read nearly the first 3 chapters and a CIA document of the patent of v2k (voice to skull) technology and had to stop. I hade become overwhelmed with fear and worry that my today might indeed be my forever. I flipped back to the resources page and was relieved to find listed 8 organizations that offered what I first learned in the Fellowship: ESH (experience strength and hope). I was able to locate two organizations within the United States and went to those websites to learn more about what I've learned has been done to me. I almost sent them both messages to try and get help but then I realized that my story is similar to all the other people within the organization and that if people are out to ""get you"" they have a way to do it no matter how illegal and not in alignment with God their behaviors are. Feeling deflated I tried to go back to sleep as my captors continued to modulate the ringing in my ears preventing me from getting any rest that night.",political,Facebook
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Candidate for US Congress Brianna Wu calls Google hearing Deeply Embarrassing  On Tuesday the House Judiciary Committee interviewed Google CEO Sundar Pichai about data collection practices in a hearing widely critiqued by mainstream press technology publications and social media. Adding to that critique was Massachusetts candidate for congress and software engineer Brianna Wu.  This was a deeply embarrassing hearing for this congress and for this country said Wu. We sent a message to the entire world that our leaders do not understand the Internet. How can we protect the American people from cyberattacks when our leaders dont even know Apple and Google are different companies?  Wu was referring to a widely criticized moment in the hearing where Iowa Congressman Steve King demanded answers from Pichai about concerns that his daughters iPhone was acting strangely. Congressman iPhone is made by another company replied Pichai.  Tuesdays hearings were widely critiqued by the press. The Washington Post reported that Pichai emerged unscathed. Fox News called the hearing a good day for Pichai. Bloomberg said the hearings botched a chance to help the public understand issues related to technology.  Wu agreed with the sentiment saying America needs leaders that understand technology issues. Congress had a chance to discuss the shocking amount of information Google gathers on Android users but they blew it. We could be mandating technology to protect the public like differential privacy. Unfortunately this congress doesnt understand enough to wonder what they dont understand.  On Twitter Wu talked about the need for America to invest in cybersecurity - and contrasted those efforts with China. Most Americans dont realize China has made terrifying military gains in their ability to conduct asymmetrical warfare with the United States said Wu. China outclasses us in their ability to conduct cyberwarfare. Its a fact that they have penetrated our power and shipping infrastructure. If we dont get serious about cyberwarfare we will not be leading the world in the next century.  Wu also stressed the need to engage with other countries for technology policy.  Ive just spent a week talking with leaders in Silicon Valley about how GDPR affects their business. While this legislation is well-intentioned it inadvertently cements the position of the largest actors like Facebook and Google. We should have been constructively engaging with Europe on this legislation. Instead we sat it out and our economy is now paying the price.,political,Facebook
Read full article: Congresswoman Hinson blasts Democrat spending plan  Iowa First District Congresswoman Ashley Hinson a Republican from Marion voted against raising the debt limit in the House Tuesday. We are hearing the Democrats in Washington D-C talking about cutting a trillion or two from a multitrillion-dollar social spending spree like they should get a pat on the back for that for being fiscally responsible Hinson says.  And I think it is very clear to Iowans that these are not nickles and dimes  we are dealing in trillions of dollars here. And the Democrats have forgotten how many zeros are in trillions.  Hinson says her vote sends a message on Democrat spending. It is critical of course that we do not default on our debt. But it is equally important that we dont let democrats spend as much as they want on whatever they want to. Or to signal to them that we will give them a pathway to do that in the future she says.  A proposal to have banks track accounts with 600 dollars or more in them is part of the Democrats spending proposal. Hinson is not in favor of the idea. Its a completely invasive policy we heard Speaker Pelosi acknowledge that for the first time Hinson says.  The Biden Administration says the proposal is designed to find people who are NOT paying taxes they owe. I can tell you loud and clear Iowans do not want the I-R-S to monitor when they are paying their bills or making a big grocery store run. I think about families making a big trip to Costco or HyVee and stocking up. Why does the government need to know that? Thats exactly why I have been leading the charge against this in Washington D-C with my legislation the Protecting Financial Privacy Act according to Hinson.  Hinson says the proposal is a way to expand the size of the I-R-S. We need more border patrol agents  not more I-R-S agents right now Hinson says.

August 19 2020  To Whom it May Concern:  I have been an educator for twenty-nine years and an English teacher at Ronkonkoma Middle School for sixteen years. I am writing to express my concerns about the current reopening plan.  The COVID-19 Pandemic has created challenging and unprecedented choices for people around the world and the choices involving school reopening have been some of the most difficult. Although many Connetquot teachers have differing views about in-person remote and hybrid learning models we all chose this profession because we want to help our students learn grow and form their unique identities.  I love my job and I miss the way it used to be.  In March of 2020 we were thrust into unknown territory. During our first weeks of remote instruction we struggled and made errors but throughout the spring we achieved incredible progress and growth. We spent countless hours creating content and planning interactive activities and we reached out to students to ensure participation and engagement.  This will bewithout a doubtthe most challenging year for every single teacher in our district regardless of the re-opening plan. Teaching has always been a profession that requires extensive planning and thoughtful reflective practices and we will rise to the challenge as we always have.  In the current synchronous instruction plan daily live streaming is required. This creates several concerns:   Loss of Creative Control: Live-streaming limits the style and content of lessons.  Privacy: Students and teachers are at risk of being recorded and judged unfairly.  Accountability: It will be impossible to simultaneously keep track of all students engagement.  Assessment: Academic integrity is not equitable (at home vs. in school).  Technological Inconsistencies: Internet access is unreliable for many students.  Planning and Preparation: This system will double the workload for our teachers.  There have not been many easy choices during this pandemic but we can choose to support each other as a community. We can choose to collaborate. We can choose to trust each other. Now more than ever we must make decisions and judgments with empathy compassion and consideration.  I ask the Connetquot Board of Education to re-consider the current reopening plan. The synchronous instruction plan is not best for our students or teachers.

"WHY A GOVERNMENT MANDATED FACE MASK ORDER IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. . A mandatory mask order violates the Equal Protection Clause of S.C. Const. art. I  3 of the South Carolina Constitution which reads: ""The privileges and immunities of citizens of this State and of the United States under this Constitution shall not be abridged nor shall any person be deprived of life liberty or property WITHOUT DUE PROCESS OF LAW."" The due process clause protects the individual against the arbitrary and unreasonable exercise of governmental power. . It is also unconstitutional because it violates the Privacy Clause of S.C. Const. art. I  10 which reads in part: ""The right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against searches and seizures and UNREASONABLE INVASIONS OF PRIVACY shall not be violated."" A mandatory face mask order is a radical infringement of the reasonable and legitimate expectation of privacy that most South Carolinians expect to have over their own bodily and facial autonomy.

I recently learned of what could be the largest security breach to date of personal records and information relating to US consumers. This breach has the potential to provide personal information relating to 340 million Americans. The company whose records were breached is known as Exactis which is a firm thats known as a data integrator which has compiled records relating to business and consumer data. The information which was breached would potentially include e-mail addresses home addresses a persons hobbies and habits as well as the numbers and ages of any children they may have. This firm has compiled information relating to an estimated 3.5 billion businesses and consumers. In the world we live in today we must expect that this type of personal data is being accumulated analyzed and sold however it is disturbing that such uniquely personal information could be stolen and used for improper or illegal purposes. We really need to establish a body of laws that address this unique vulnerability and to protect the privacy of people like you and me.,political,Facebook
Mental Health care in the United States: ====================== The first thing I wish to note is the use of statistics. Both conservative and liberal has utilized statistics to foster and/or foment a particular idea belief or concept. To fully quantify this argument I wish to cite Benjamin Disraeli (former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom) there are three kinds of lies: Lies damn lies and statistics. I am always skeptical of statistical tabulation and the use of statistical values without appropriate citations. NOW to the point of our initial contact and conversation (mental health). We can go much further back to Sigmund Freud as well as the combat operations of World War I that catapulted our world violently and directly into the mental health world. But this is a very very long story  just about this time frame. Cutting to the chase. Why is our mental health care system so badly damaged? First the stigma of mental health. Many psychologists have found that men are less willing to seek mental health assistance. Women on the other hand are far more willing to seek mental health assistance. Both sexes increase their willingness to seek mental health assistance if they have sought out higher levels of education. But men are still far less likely. The other problem we must acknowledge is the lack of information knowledge and techniques to assist people with mental health issues. We must remember that Sigmund Freud did not truly begin his techniques of psychoanalysis concepts until 1885.  1918 end of World War I we were not even remotely competent in helping the severely mentally damaged from combat environments. 1945 end of World War II we were again still not competent in assisting combat veterans with severe mental issues. 1975 end of the Vietnam conflict AGAIN we had nothing. Veterans Administration (VA) hospitals State and Federal run mental health institutions etc. were bastions of filth. The only individuals who could find clean decent and helpful health care (physical mental etc.) were those with money. Now there were reasonable assistive elements in the VA and State and Federal run institutions. How can I say this? The VA is exceptionally well known for having doctors who have developed incredibly innovative techniques and procedures for decades. And State and Federal mental health institutions always provided relevant assistance to those seeking help. State and Federal mental health institutions always attempted to assist their patients/clients.  - DISCLAIMER: There are some egregiously notorious locations that have done abusive things to their patients/clients.  With that being said President Jimmy Carter began a comprehensive evaluation of the mental health care system. He put together a massive team to completely revamp retool and progressively fund all State and Federal mental health facilities throughout the United States. This includes the newly created entity within the Veterans Administration called the Vet Center.  QUICK NOTE: As noted above Vietnam veterans were not different in the lack of treatment and care not given in previous wars and conflicts. What became different was the change in deliverance reception transmission and rapidity of information processing.  Previously no one talked. Previous combat veterans drank themselves to death institutionalized as incredibly psychotic became a violent criminal and many other not nice and definitely not good conclusions. Now because of President Jimmy Carter and his comprehensive evaluation not only did veterans get a powerful new concept to dramatically effectively and exponentially increase their privacy but the entire country gained a massively newly renovated mental health system to directly help everyone.  BUT. And this is a BIG BUT.  This legislation was enacted/signed into law on 07 October 1980. Ronald Reagan wins the Presidential election 04 November 1980. Reagan is sworn in as President on 20 January 1981. Reagan nullifies the Mental Health Systems Act (MHSA) on 31 August 1981. Now Reagan did not nullify the entire act. The Vet Center system remained intact. But the most critical parts were completely destroyed. Reagan dismissively provided a singular point of funding through the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981. But the damage was done. Over the next few decades the majority of State and Federal mental health institutions shuddered.  With the massive loss of so many socialist funded mental health providers we as a population could only find mental health care through two methods: - Criminal incarceration. - Wealthy enough to afford it.  The next time anyone tried to re-start what President Carter tried to do was via First Lady Hillary Clinton (now Secretary Clinton). Her attempts were aggressively destroyed by partisan diatribes about Founding Fathers wanting a smaller government. - NOTE: This is an absolute falsehood created by white nationalists (I can prove it.). So we eventually had to wait till President Obama took office before we could legislate AGAIN a comprehensive revamping of our entire health care system. But this again was derided as a BIG government concept.  - FUTURE NOTE: If we had Medicare-For-All right now we could have slightly reduced tens of thousands of deaths from viral infections like CoVid-19.  REMEMBER: People like Sarah Palin screamed about Death Panels. REMEMBER: As recent as a month ago Lieutenant Governor of Texas said we should just let our elderly just die for our country. Not exactly a humane or Christian concept. POINT OF ORDER: Up until Reagan Democrats and Republicans could pretty much work together. It was not till Reagan orated his 11th Commandment that drove a massive stake right through their ability to find common ground.  The 11th Commandment was as such Thou shalt not speak ill of another Republican. Originally this was a self-serving concept. Reagan was being torn apart of fellow Republicans during his bid to win the Governorship in California. He eventually began to use it very often and actively used it during his tenor as the President. Ultimately the 11th Commandment became engrained deeply into Republicans so much so that it was literally a sin to speak ill of a fellow Republican.  Ponder that for a few moments. A Republican could say the vilest most disgusting and even incredibly criminal concepts and NO Republican was/is allowed to speak ill of them. Senator John McCain spoke against Trump. All Republicans have aggressively vilified an incredibly courageous and honorable veteran in direct support of Trump. Senator Mitt Romney spoke against Trump. All Republicans are aggressively vilifying Romney at every turn  or staying completely silent.  One last point HEALTH CARE FOR ALL. Period.  Someone who cuts off women to save THEIR beliefs is not a humane individual.  Paid for by John Warren Crandall,political,Facebook
In case you missed my statement today.  There is never a right time or right way to do the wrong thing. In the COVID-19 scenario contact tracing is technically wrong financially wrong and morally wrong.  Contact tracing is technically wrong as it may be an effective tool to trace slow moving deadly viruses such as Ebola or Tuberculosis but not for a fast-moving virus with a low death rate that is primarily spread by asymptomatic people.  Contact tracing for COVID-19 is a colossal waste of money which could be better spent on resources to protect the elderly and immune-compromised populations that are the most affected.  Contact tracing will shred our constitutional rights to privacy.  Texas must stop contact tracing and change course by adopting new policies consistent with the facts as we now know them; COVID-19 death rate is much less than the first suggested 3-7% it primarily affects seniors and immune-compromised not equally across the full population.  Going forward Texas must immediately remove all business operating restrictions continue to focus attention on hot spots and congregate living situations and trust Texans to act responsibility to protect themselves and their neighbor.,political,Facebook
"ABSENTEE VOTER BALLOTS- VOTERS BEWARE  This coming November was going to be the first time my husband and I were going to use an Absentee Voters (AV) ballot. However I decided to do some research on the subject in general because of concerns expressed to me via private messaging. What I found out has me very concerned. My husband and I will be going to the polls instead of using the AV ballot.  The Washington Post published a thorough analysis of alleged voter fraud cases over four years in Arizona Ohio Georgia Texas and Kansas. Predictably the study confirmed that in-person voter fraud is simply not a problem: In none of these states over those four years has a single person been caught impersonating another voter in order to cast an illegitimate ballot.  So much for in-person voter fraud. But does that mean voter fraud doesnt exist at all? No. Voter fraud does happenbut it almost never occurs at the polls. Instead as election law expert Rick Hasen has explained VOTER FRAUD OCCURS THROUGH ABSENTEE BALLOTS. THE VAST MAJORITY OF VOTER FRAUD PROSECUTIONS INVOLVE ABSENTEE BALLOTS THAT WERE ILLEGALLY CAST. AND THE ONLY VOTING FRAUD SCHEMES WITH THE POTENTIAL TO ACTUALLY SWING ELECTIONS INVOLVED MAIL-IN BALLOTS NOT IMPERSONATION AT THE POLLS. (This makes sense: Its much easier to forge a signature impersonate a voter or buy a vote in the privacy of ones home than it is in a voting booth at the polls.)  In North Carolina for a US House Election Ballots were collected from voters and taken into possession unlawfully; witness certifications were signed indicating the signor had witnessed the voter vote the absentee ballot when he or she had not and the ballots were mailed in such a manner to conceal the fact that the voter had not personally mailed it himself"" the indictment details. ""It thereby served to undermine the integrity of the absentee ballot process and the publics confidence in the outcome of the electoral process.""  The list of voter AV fraud goes on from all across the country. When one goes to the polls the upmost in security is used to protect your ballot. You slide your ballot into a machine that is locked and tamper-proof and is opened that night by only the clerks employees and election board officials and counted.  However federal and state rules/regulations for AV ballots are not as strict as ballots handled at the poles. AV ballots can be stored for weeks waiting to be tabulated on Election Day eve.  In fact as more people use AV ballots the more strain put on the clerks department because many are having a difficult time tabulating the large numbers of AV Ballots in one night. Many clerks throughout the country are asking to have a number of days before Election Day to start counting the AV ballots.  I feel AV ballots should be put into some kind of safe or lock-box right after they have been received and the signature verified. According to our clerk The signatures are checked by my staff each day. The ballots and the count of the ballots are verified each day and are kept in a locked and secured room"". So the question is who in city hall also has a key to that locked room beside our honest and hardworking clerk and his staff? Its a rhetorical question because other than the clerks office who is going to own up to having a key to this secured room.  Too many mysterious things have happened in our city that makes me leery. For instance no one knows who decided to delete 10 years worth of agendas back-ups and claims from the Dearborn Heights website; which many of us used for researching. How did a TPOAM contract get switched so the contract the council voted on was not the one the council was given to read or the one agreed to by the members of the TPOAM?  AV is very convenient to be sure but is convenience worth more than the integrity of the election?",political,Facebook
Please like share or follow this FB page.  According to the U.S. Department of Justice Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) facts regarding child on child sexual abuse are as follows:  Juveniles account for more than one-third (35.6%) of those known to law enforcement to have committed sex offenses against other minors;  Child on child sexual abuse is more likely than adult sex offenses to occur in groups and at schools;  Child on child sexual abuse tends to involve more male and younger victims;  The percentage of child on child sexual abuse is highest between ages 15 and 17;  Child on child sexual abuse most often occurs in the home (68% of the time) somewhat less than that of adult sex offenses (80%);  Offenses against teenagers are typically higher among mid to late adolescence while offenses against victims under the age of 12 are typically lower;  About 1 out of every 8 juvenile offenders is under the age of 12;  and Child on child sexual abuse comprises more than one-quarter (25.8%) of all sex offenses.  Those who have been identified as having committed child on child sexual abuse cover a broad age range:  5% are under the age of 9 years;  16% are less than 12 years old;  38% are between ages of 12 and 14;  46% are between ages 15 and 17; and  93% are male.  Juveniles identified as having committed child on child sexual abuse are more likely than adults to do the following:  Offend in groups with one or more co-offenders (24% for juveniles versus 14% for adults);  Offend at a school (12% versus 2%);  Commit sodomy (13% versus 7%) and fondling (49% versus 42%);  Target younger children under the age of 12 (59% versus 39%); and  Victimize males (25% versus 13%)  Minors are less likely than adults to commit rape (24% versus 31%).  Like adults minors will sexually offend in the privacy of the home (about 69% of the time) more often than in public places.  .........................................................  Unfortunately there are too many sexual assaults & rapes in the juvenile population. Its time to get serious about Juvenile Sexual Predators; a juvenile rapist is a juvenile rapist! Lets not sugarcoat Juvenile Sexual Violence. Our laws are inadequate to protect the victims and we need actual proper treatment for Juvenile Sexual Predators.  #endjuvenileonjuvenilesexualassaultandrape #endsiblingsexualabuse #juvenilesexualpredator #juvenilerapevictim #familyreunificationshouldneverbethegoal #SaveTheChildren #nomeansno #SilentNoMore,political,Facebook
Dear Connetquot Community  I am a Connetquot School District teacher. I am deeply troubled by the unilateral decision made by Dr. Adams and how it will negatively affect your children.  My union leaders were part of a district committee that had been working with the district since the beginning of July trying to create a practical and effective plan to educate your children. A remote plan was almost complete while the in-person plan had a strong foundation and needed more discussion on some issues. The important point is we were working collaboratively in the best interests of your children. Unfortunately my union leaders were informed on Friday August 14th that the plans being discussed were entirely replaced with one that we had no input in.  I bring this to your attention because quite honestly my colleagues and I are stunned. In addition to how live streaming will negatively impact me as a teacher it will also have a negative impact on your childrens education. Regardless as to whether your children are going to school or fully remote the live streaming plan is detrimental to their education. The district did not share their plan with my union or any of the teachers.  I have not been provided any information from the district as to how the plan is to work what I will be teaching how many students I will have in my classroom no details and my union leaders have not had their myriad of questions addressed either. There has been no information from the district about how we will teach our special needs population or those students who require counseling and other services.  There are many issues that the district did not fully vet before making this hasty decision. If my lessons are being live streamed out to the community how can I protect the information regarding my students privacy? How do I protect the privacy of my special education population? How do I discipline a student during a live video feed to the world and not violate FERPA? How will students feel secure in answering questions take risks etc. in a classroom where everything they say and do will be broadcast to the world? How long until a video of me or one of my students is made then edited and uploaded to social media for the world to see? How will teachers connect with their students in their usual ways which might be quite different then the norm but are highly effective. I know I will not take the risk knowing that every word and action I say or do is being broadcast to the world.  I am not trained to teach via live streaming. I do not want to be sitting in front of a computer teaching your children or only allowed to work from a Smart Board as it appears Dr. Adams has said it has to be. That is not teaching. In addition to all the additional stresses this year brings with it with live streaming it brings additional concerns and stress regarding FERPA violations.  Let me finish with the following. Yes I am concerned and quite uncomfortable having a camera recording everything that is said and done in my classroom. It is impossible to be an effective teacher if you are walking on eggshells the entire time you are with your students. But more than that I see this experiment ending badly and not being an effective way to educate your children.  I am asking that you reach out to the Board of Education Dr. Adams and all other administrators and demand that teachers have input into whatever plan is eventually chosen. This hastily put together plan by one person without teacher input will have negative consequences on the effectiveness of the education your children receive.  The Connetquot teachers provide tremendous amounts of support to this community and for the sake of this community we are asking for your support on this. Thank you stay healthy and safe.,political,Facebook
The sector responsible for the Black Market cameras and the Terrorist Facebook coup are fully responsible for all child abductions and human trafficking. They enslave child victims found on Facebook by using the black market cameras to learn the daily HABITS of the parents (day in and out activities and the family schedule making it easier for abduction) THIS IS THE REASON WE THE PEOPLE ARE BEING WATCHED AND LISTED TO FOR THE PURPOSE OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING ALONE. Many of these child abductions mutilations and murders from the DARK WEB are captured by recording from the viewers phones then the content is shared via Facebook Messenger. This information is leaked to me by FORMER Facebook Moderators giving us the ability to prove this content is REAL and exists. Some of which are suing Facebook for PTSD and most likely arent talking much due to fear. These CRIMES are shared on video messenger procedurally to prove the assaults are taking place (confirmation the assaults are executed as proof). This information is being suppressed to the public; fueling the pursuit of many lawsuits even though Facebook deems the content inadmissible!! INSANITY! These are the same scary cameras written about on several news outlets including FOX NEWS years ago. The Government spy cameras in every home story lost its steam by suppression of information and now Facebook is left facing repercussion and decimation.  The Terrorist Coup created a series of videos shared to average Americans for the purpose of teaching military style brainwashing techniques and CIA mind control. This is the sole purpose of human trafficking and majority of child abductions. Recently Mark Zuckerberg proclaimed publicly that Law enforcement will not be giving permission to look at deleted messages on Facebooks back door. Claiming that it is a conflict of privacy ironically the same thing he was previously indicted for last year. Most of our US politicians are not aware of this and I believe this Facebook coup is responsible for the confusion of the impeachment. This group has used Obamas name to slander and blame him for terrorist activity including the responsibility of 9/11. And has incriminated President Trump by impersonating him via phone calls and emails. Leaving conduct of misinformation and the ability to control mass medias. ALL big pedophilia stories fester from deleted Facebook messages and we have every ounce of proof needed to end that corruption in Washington DC. This group has completely infiltrated the government by impersonating elite political figures and manipulation using back door tactics via unsecured emails and Facebook. ALL of this proof can be found on deleted Facebook profiles and groups impersonating the Cartel or the Middle East. The group has been able to gain access to governments finances using hackers and programmers leading to the Government shut down last December. Years ago with the story of government spy cameras we also reported plans to shut off the internet. These plans are consistently being exposed and executed on the Dark Web Black Market cameras. It was reported MANY banks backed up their DATA on external devices for the purpose of this indefinite internet shut down. Banks will not access their iCloud in the event of the internet shut down and the same practitioners have stolen cash including from the US treasury then flooded the bottom line with zeros using hackers under fear of death. They use HUMAN TRAFFICKERS to mind control any world leader to achieve the desired result whatever that may be. Thousands of people mostly children are being abducted and kept in various warehouses all over the country coining the name brainwashers resorts forced to preform PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE. They has been doing this for many MANY YEARS making Facebook a sociological experiment and it is almost impossible to tell. A huge team of people against their will watch the rings closely on the BLACK MARKET CAMERAS.,political,Facebook
Did you know there were 34 community members and 18 school employees that joined the Facility Planning Committee? 52 people offered their guidance on how this bond would go to the people for a vote.  Below are a few things we (The PAC) uncovered*:  The purpose of the FPC was to: 1. assist the school district as we work to evaluate the use capacity and condition of existing district facilities; 2. identify the most pressing needs facing Scurry-Rosser ISD relative to facilities; 3. discuss and develop facility improvement and expansion plans to meet the identified needs; 4. evaluate the financial impact of funding for capital improvement projects; 5. provide the administration and governance team (Board of Trustees) with FPC findings and make recommendations; 6. engage the community in dialogue regarding long-range facilities and improvement needs in support of the school district.  During our FPC meetings we were able to:  review the capacity and condition of our existing facilities  share student population growth forecasts  discuss the district's finances  learn about funding for capital projects  prioritize our facility needs  answer questions from our members  random digressions into productive conversations  Some points to consider:  Our elementary school is at 95% capacity and the middle school is at 89%.  The high school student capacity should remain stable with room for approximately 100 more students.  The district is expected to grow at a rate of at least 3% or 30 students per year. The trend is towards predominantly younger children.  Current transfer students are not impacting school capacity at any of our campuses.  There are NO non-employee transfer students in grades Pre-K through 4th.  Currently NO new transfers are allowed in our district other than for the children of our new employees which is less than two per grade level.  The cost of a NEW school is the MOST EXPENSIVE solution for solving student capacity and we believe it should not be considered. Adding on to the elementary is the most economical way to solve our student capacity needs in grades PreK - 8th grade. The latest financial estimate for expanding the elementary school would require about $20 million dollars. Although the district has limited funds set aside for building improvements and small construction projects we currently do not have enough money to expand the elementary and would need positive results from a voting referendum to raise capital funds.  *the information provided was the result of exercising our Public Information Act. This information was provided to all 52 members of the Facility Planning Committee. These members are currently undisclosed to respect their privacy.,political,Facebook
All board members need to have a good understanding of how a school district runs and the many working pieces it takes to keep school moving in the right direction. In order to get to know me a little better I have provided below the full questions and answers for the Bangor Daily article for you.  INTERVIEW: full questions from the Bangor Daily with my unedited answers.  1. What motivated you to run as a candidate for the Ellsworth School Board of Directors?  I am running to be reelected because I still have so much work to do for our district. I have worked tirelessly to bring our board to a state of higher transparency in order to make sure we operate with the feedback of all stakeholders. Now that this board is open to this critical input it is a top priority that we stay involved and engaged. Our policies goals and vision statement need to reflect this. I personally hope to achieve this by making sure that every student; without regard to race religion gender economic status and much more can walk through that door and have an equitable school experience that results in a positive move forward. Equally every staff member needs the same employment opportunity with zero stereotypes or stimas and needs to be supported with all the tools and training needed to do the job as well as a contract and working environment that motivates each staff member to stay. This means keeping informed and proactive as a board member in order to understand and take action on all the needs within our district.  As we well know these needs are bound to change with not only each year but also every situation (such as covid). I will continue to look at the individual needs of our district and make decisions based on what will best improve our goal of success and safety. Thus far half of my time serving on the board has been during this pandemic. As all of you know the learning curve to this is steep. I have had the distinct advantage of having a husband who is a pharmacist that currently serves on the federal disaster team and who also wrote the federal guidelines for what to do in all types of disasters (pandemics nuclear war dirty bombs viral warfare hurricanes floodling etc.) while he served on a presidential committee for then president Obama. This has given me unparalleled access to critical information as this crisis unfolds. Not only do I get information on changes from the CDC in real time I also get WHO information and information as to how other government agencies around the world are responding. This is vital to understanding how our own agencies make rulings and how effective or non politically motivated those rulings are. That way I have a crystal clear picture of how this impacts us locally and the domino effect for each ruling. It has been and will continue to be my top priority to get all of us through this covid crisis safely. I believe I can continue to do so while providing an opportunity for the best educational experience to happen in our district.  2. Do you have children who are enrolled in the Ellsworth school system? If so what grades are they in?  Yes. We have a child in middle school.  3. Do you have a working background in education? What do you do for work now?  My family has lived in Ellsworth for 16 years. I went to college for early childhood education and school psychology. My passion for education stems from the long line of educators in my family. While working and going to college I volunteered at schools in FL where my relatives worked for 7 years before coming to Maine. I worked as a sub in Ellsworth for 5 years and was so impressed by the warmth and dedication of our Ellsworth teachers. When I had a child at last and enrolled her in Ellsworth I jumped into volunteering in our schools and have loved getting to work with these wonderful people. I have been part of the PTF for going on 8 years. Organizing and volunteering in all kinds of things like Harry Potter week Halloween night Holiday gifting day field days the Walk A Thon the Grand program with or schools Book Fairs and much more. It gives me such joy to make the education experience engaging and inviting for our kids.  I am self employed. I work as a private contractor for business needing help creating and managing thier online business. I am also a costume maker on the side. I regularly volunteer for The Grand. During the pandemic I started the non profit group 'Masks For Hancock County' where we sewed and shipped thousands of masks for anyone who needed them as well as a variety of PPE for frontline workers in Hancock as well as all over Maine and across the country.  4. Are you in favor of continuing to require masking for students staff and visitors inside city schools and facilities as long as Maine CDC recommends the practice to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Hancock County? If you would change that requirement how would you do so?  At the current case load and vaccine availability yes I am in favor of wearing masks. I agree that masks help slow the spread of covid but I don't think masks should be universally mandated when Hancock reaches a status of Green and the vaccine has been offered to 5 and up. Our votes need to reflect real time situations unfolding in our county at the current time. Waiting on national standards or even state standards to relax our rules means our kids would stay masked until places like Tampa FL and Portland ME got their case loads down regardless of what was happening in our town.*  5. Do you favor continuing to have crosswalks painted in rainbow Pride colors at the citys high school and elementary/middle school? Why do you favor or oppose doing so?  100% yes. I advocated and voted for this already. For kids old enough to understand what the rainbows stand for it makes a clear statement of inclusion in an environment that had previously felt insular. For those too young to understand they see it as a brilliantly colored crosswalks. They brighten the atmosphere for everyone.  6. Are there other issues that you feel are important for the Ellsworth school system to address that you feel are not being adequately addressed? If so can you identify a few of them and say what steps you would pursue to address those issues as a member of the school board?  Pre-pandemic I was working on many areas that I would like to get back to. School climate for everyone. Students staff and families. We have started down the path of diving deeper into the culture within our walls to make sure we are providing the best environment to give each person a chance to thrive. This needs evaluating is many areas like employee contracts equity of education and inclusion anti bullying planning for success past high school curriculum and grading updates and better communication within the district as well as a continued transparency**.  7. What else would you like voters to know about you or about what you hope to accomplish as a school board member?  . I am a huge fan of data but not necessarily a fan of standardized tests. Teachers need to have easy access to standardized test data as it is one of many tools used to help steer the boat but it's not the entire story.  Teachers are the scientists of the school putting together daily plans of action to best produce optimal student outcomes based on previous data. When we as a board make changes we need to talk to these educators for their analysis and data and always use multiple resources of credible information to shape our plans.  One of my biggest accomplishments while serving on the school board was getting a bill sponsored that got signed into law. A law that improves public education for every student and teacher in Maine. This is a pretty rare accomplishment. I did this by listening to the families and staff about what some of the biggest challenges are in education. Our public schools have become choked with mandates that take up copius amounts of school time. Many mandates are out dated underfunded and even redundant. This law is a massive step in cleaning up that system and making education the best it can be. Of I get the privilege of a second term I have plans for another bill I hope to have sponsored to help our high school students through the state.  Someone was asking about where I stood on mandates for the covid vaccine in our schools. I thought this is a perspective that people have a right to know about. I love this vaccine. I couldn't wait to get it and got my child vaccinated as soon as we could. However I don't believe my personal feelings about the vaccine should ever infringe on you making your own choices for you and your family. Row v Wade gave us all the right to medical privacy. I would much rather make my husband (a pharmacist who is one of the people tasked with the vaccine roll out for MDI and who helped write policy on how to handle pandemics under president Obama) available to answer any and all questions a person might have about the vaccine. I want people to want this for themselves. I will make sure they have all the scientific information. And I will respect everyone's privacy no matter what they choose to do. I believe in my body my choice and plan to stand by that.  * information and recommendations from the WHO differed from the CDC on masks wearing. Both being very credible sources all the information needed to be read and analyzed. During the pandemic my husband had meetings with the CDC where the CDC changed their own rulings sometimes 3x in ONE day on the same issue. This is one of the reasons we need to understand not only each recommendation but also the reasons why those recommendations are made and the local impact.  **Fact. I was the first Ellsworth School Board member to regularly reach out to citizens through social media to keep people better informed. I ushered our school board into an age of information and transparency that had never existed at this level before I took office. Transparency matters. I didn't just promise something in my 3 years on the board I pushed HARD for this and took it to a whole new level. I already have plans in the works with my fellow policy committee member to bring about a new district run information outlet on social media for all parents and guardians to have centralized information with easy access in the future. If you looked back to the last time the board got to do the board self evaluation (recorded and archived online) you would know just how hard I pushed for this and what I was up against when I came on the board 3 years ago.,political,Facebook

"Bullying is a problem. Everywhere.  The Metrowest Youth Risk Survey shows a trajectory of increased anxiety and depression in our children. Many of them cite treatment from peers as a significant factor. Let's not wait for a tragedy to take action.  I am not naive enough to think that we can solve all that ills adolescence. I am not content with helplessness either. My question is: What can we do in Holliston?  This summer I am taking a deep dive on this subject - looking at research models of communities that have successfully found a way to shift the cultural paradigm making schools a ""safe zone"" instead of a ""danger zone.""  I want to understand why kids bully why no one is immune from dishing it out or receiving it. What the adult community can do to affect change. Throwing our hands up and saying things like ""it's everywhere"" ""tale as old as time"" ""rite of passage"" solutions do not make. Maybe there is no cure but surely there must be a remedy. Ours are not bad kids. Their behaviors are symptoms. Putting it on the schools to solve is a recipe for failure... they are bound by state regulations and laws from everything to privacy to punishment. That is not to say they don't have a strong role to play - though theirs is just that - a part.  So. I'm reaching out to the community to those who might be a resource or can point me to one. I welcome your perspective your insights. I am not looking to get into a dialogue about individual situations... I am taking a macro look and hope to add some researched knowledge to the mix come fall to a study group at the School Committee level.  PM me or email me at shaughnessyj@hsc.holliston.k12.ma.us.  p.s. Good people if your advice is that kids need to deal with it themselves to ""toughen them up for the real world"" I'll save you some time. I am deaf to these proclamations. Our job is to teach promote growth. They have their entire adulthood to ""deal."" Let's at least teach them how.",political,Facebook
I want to be able to buy a saddle without the IRS asking questions. This is the United States not the USSR. We are a free country and it is not cool that President Biden wants the IRS spying on us.  If Congress goes along with this craziness people will be putting their money under their mattresses to protect their privacy!  Our credit cards our debit cards our checks our withdrawals and our deposits will be subject to review by the IRS. This is a gross infringement of our freedoms. Who is the IRS to question our expenditures? Whats next? Will the government tell us what we can and cannot spend on?  With horrendous policy changes like this being proposed it makes it so critical to send a Conservative with backbone to DC. As the next Congressman I will protect our freedoms and our privacy! #alpolitics #ImpeachBiden #andyforcongress,political,Facebook
"he Real Jane Roe in Roe v. Wade  She was just 22 years old at the time--a young woman who found herself pregnant in a state where abortion was illegal unless the mother's life was endangered. That state was Texas. The year was 1970 and her real name was Norma L. McCorvey. Norma Leah was born in the back swamps of Louisiana but her parents moved the family to Dallas before they divorced when Norma was just 13 years old. There is evidence that Norma was abused by her father and that the home life was very unsettled and tense. Norma's mother was also a violent alcoholic who also could have been abusive to her daughter. Norma was sent to a reform school to try and get her back on track with a new attitude toward her studies but it did not work. Norma who was pregnant dropped out of high school at sixteen ran away with her boyfriend got married to him ( Elwood McCorvey ) and moved with him to California. The marriage failed quickly with Norma turning up on her mother's doorstep soon after with a small infant. Knowing that her daughter had no idea of what parenting meant Norma's mother took the child herself to raise the little girl. Eventually Norma went to live on the streets where she found herself homeless a high school drop-out addicted to alcohol and drugs financially destitute or temporarily living with some soul who took her in for care and protection. Again she was pregnant However this time the father wanted his baby. The condition he put to Norma was that she would never see the baby or become involved in the raising of the child. Norma accepted the ultimatum. When Norma becomes pregnant for the third and final time it would change her life forever. It would also change the life of a nation in legal and societal ways up to the present time--2019. So Norma had two children who were not aborted but what would she do about the third pregnancy? She might have left Texas for another state which did allow for abortions. She might have put the baby up for adoption. Or she might have tried to get around the law. Norma swore up and down to all who would listen that she had been raped. She insisted that she was the innocent victim of a sexual assault. However there had been no police report to verify that assertion. There was no corroborating evidence to help the police or Norma. Fortunately or unfortunately Norma was directed by adoption officials to seek out the help of two particular attorneys--Linda Coffee and Sarah Weddington.  These two active female attorneys would eventually enter the ensuing court papers and the legal confrontations which would eventually please the feminist movement that was growing quickly in the U.S. and much of Europe. The two attorneys took up the case in 1970 with the plaintiff being ""Jane Roe"" in Roe v. Wade. In 1970 a suit was filed in Dallas in a three-judge federal court on behalf of a pregnant woman known as Jane Roe and all other women ""who were or might become pregnant and want to consider all options."" The suit was against Henry Wade the district attorney at Dallas an official responsible for enforcing criminal laws including abortion statutes. The suit asked that Texas law be declared unconstitutional and that an injunction be issued telling Wade to stop prosecuting doctors who performed abortions. It was during these court proceedings that Norma gave birth to a healthy baby girl who was put up for adoption immediately. She was not yet free to consider an abortion in Texas. The case would make its way up to the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS ).  On January 22 1973 SCOTUS issued its very famous and controversial 7 to 2 decision. The majority stated that most laws against abortion violate a constitutional right to privacy thus overturning all state laws outlawing or restricting abortion. The decision was based on the 9th and 14th amendments. This was a landmark ruling which essentially divided the nation into 2 camps: Pro-choice and Pro-life. Opposition to Roe came primarily from those who viewed and still do that the Court had overstepped or strayed too far from the text and history of the Constitution. There was also opposition from those who believed in the personhood of fetal human life while in the womb. Supporters came from those who viewed and still do that a women has the right to privacy equality and personal freedom. Another two groups from law enforcement and health services wanted to save women from unclean and unethical conditions irreputable sources and from the distinct possibility of death during an illegal or botched abortion.  Coffee and Weddington were elated with the decision. It had never been a question in their minds about whether Norma L. McCorvey had been raped but rather about the legal fight and legal results that would help all women be able to seek an abortion regardless of rape. Was Norma elated as well? Did this long very personal and public debate leave her feeling vindicated satisfied ready to go on to the next chapter of her life? Did she publicly express gratitude for her attorneys' efforts and victory? No. While it is true that her real identity was kept secret from the public for a decade in the 80's Norma herself revealed the ""Roe"" identity and all ""hell"" broke loose in Texas surrounding her private life. Her public and personal appearances brought extreme reactions within her daily life. While trying to buy groceries at local businesses other shoppers began shouting matches against her gun shots were taken at her home day or night as well as personal assaults directed towards her verbally and physically. Harassment was common for Norma in Texas during this aftermath. Norma was also feeling as if she had been ""used"" by feminist groups; they still seemed to be looking down on her as a symbol of how not to be--poorly educated especially by elitist females all over the country. At one point Norma sought refuge in a lesbian relationship for two years before dissolving the relationship.  Norma brought on another form of great stress when she proclaimed herself to be a pro-life activist as well as a born again Christian. She would seek Christian counseling over a period of time and would become an active member of the Catholic Church in Dallas. She was invited for television interviews and other public appearances such as parades and speaking opportunities. Being thrown into the limelight with her identity unmasked was a challenge indeed. With the help of ghostwriters Norma had two books published on her life of the streets of the Roe v. Wade ordeal and of her public notoriety: I Am Roe: My Life Roe v. Wade and Freedom of Choice and Won by Love: Norma L. McCorvey Jane Roe of Roe v. Wade Speaks out for the Unborn as She Shares Her New Conviction for Life. Unfortunately neither publication was a victory for pro-lifer or for pro-choice. Norma continued to maintain until her death that the first trimester of pregnancy was fine for an abortion. Norma L. McCorvey died in 2017 within an assisted facility of heart complications. Perhaps if she had known about the new medical technology for observing the fetus in the womb during all three trimesters her awareness of life in uterine environment would have made her emotionally more mature--realizing that the most recent facts were very important in making life changing decisions. Before death Norma made a rather insightful version of the problem: ""More and more I'm the issue.I don't know if I should be the issue. Abortion is the issue. I never even had an abortion.""  Part 2 of this presentation will appear on Women to Women in about 3 weeks. This second part will focus on where the country is today in light of the Roe v. Wade decision--especially as Governor Andrew Cuomo signed into law on the anniversary January 22 2019 an extreme abortion law. Will it too affect the other states to become a national/federal and eventual SCOTUS decision? In the meantime here below are current facts. Carol Paz at npazcar@aol.com.

Im going to get a lot of hate for this but I disagree with Congressman ORourke regarding the confiscation of certain guns. I recognize the rationale behind removing certain weapons from peoples homes but I question the constitutionality of forced removal. Firstly itd be a logistical nightmare. How will you determine what sorts of weapons someone already has in their home without violating their privacy and individual liberty? Secondly millions of law abiding gun owners will refuse under penalty of law as a matter of principle and protest. I am not opposed to gun reform stricter laws or the barring of certain weapons continuing to be manufactured. I do support guy buyback programs that incentivize people to sell their weapons to the government. But I have my personal limits as a proud Democrat and gun owner.,political,Facebook

These are values I will bring if elected Mayor of Martinsville!  DEVELOPMENT  What is your long-term vision for Martinsville and how do we get there?  Answer: My long term vision for Martinsville is that it becomes a place families want to move to and are proud to live in. I want people to look at Martinsville as one of the top communities in Central Indiana to live and raise their family. In todays workforce many look for where they want to live and then look for jobs- that is a huge change from when I was young. In order for this vision to become a reality we must create new high paying jobs and I believe that can occur with a new industrial park.  Given broad development the city is currently experiencing what are three key strategies you would focus on to maintain the momentum and create a great place to live work and play?  Answer: The downtown is developing which is great. We need to work to make the rest of the city a great place to live that means investment in the neighborhoods where people live investment in all the parks around the city and finally investment in a new industrial park to bring the high paying jobs here that are needed to support the downtown businesses and bring first time home buyers to our city neighborhoods.  How do you propose to attract new businesses to the area and what businesses do you see as the best fit?  Answer: I have spoken to several landowners outside of flood zones already as I attempt to identify an area that we can plan for commercial and industrial growth. We need to secure 100 plus acres and prepare the area so we can attract businesses to come here who want direct access to I-69 those options arent as readily available in Johnson and Marion County as they have already developed along 37. We may not be able to attract one employer of 250 plus jobs at first but we are more likely to secure 4 to 5 employers offering 40 to 50 jobs each.  Our communitys reputation is based on the perception of those outside looking in. What efforts if any should the city take to influence our reputation in a positive way?  Answer: Unfortunately our community suffers from a reputation based on a false narrative. In fact that narrative has been proven false. Combating this reputation starts at home we all live here and we should take pride in our community. We need to instill in our own residents a form of pride and then carry that outside of Martinsville. I believe we should also start a marketing campaign for our city which is designed to go to other communities college campuses and businesses and recruit them to come grow with us by showing them what Martinsville has to offer and how great the people here are.  Extensive investment has been put into the downtown corridor particularly through public-private partnerships. What role do you see those playing if elected? More less about the same? And why?  Answer: If elected I am very interested in looking into the specifics of those public-private partnerships in detail. Public-private partnerships can be a great thing or as we saw with section 5 of the I-69 project can turn into an expensive mistake for tax payers. From the outside looking in I believe the downtown corridor public-private partnership is doing great things. I cant currently speak to what role I will play if elected until I review the partnership in detail to make sure I am making the right choice for tax payers.  The citys redevelopment commission has launched the downtown action plan as part of the citys effort to revitalize the area. What are your thoughts on the plan?  Answer: It is so important that we make sure to have long term plans and the redevelopment commission has done a good job of spearheading this. I believe a downtown that is more pedestrian and bicycle friendly will be a very good thing for our residents and recruiting new families to come live here but we must make sure the city as a whole is becoming more pedestrian and bicycle friendly.  What role if any should public arts play in the city? City-backed efforts? Private efforts? A combination? Or not a priority?  Answer: I believe public arts should be part of our overall plan within the City of Martinsville. The display of art can help enhance the aesthetics of our city. I believe that a partnership could be formed between both public and private entities or individuals to help promote and display various works of art within our city. It is our hope that there will be an increase in the number of people that visit Martinsville and public art can help visually improve our city.  INFRASTRUCTURE  Housing  whether availability affordability or subpar conditions  has been cited as a significant problem in the city. What steps should the city take to improve those conditions?  Answer: For a number of years the city has had an Unsafe Housing Authority. This Authority has been very active over the past 3  years and has helped improve unsafe structures within our city. I would want to continue the Unsafe Housing Authority Board.  In regard to the availability or affordability of housing if we increase job opportunities for our citizens we would further be able to increase the availability of housing. These opportunities could be both with attracting companies to locate within our city to allow our citizens to have jobs or further with the construction of I-69 having more land dedicated for housing to enable people to locate in Martinsville. Proper planning would enable these opportunities to happen.  Streets sidewalks and general infrastructure  the backbone of city services. What is your plan to maintain and/or improve the citys infrastructure?  Answer: I believe that our city desperately needs to identify a grid system for the improvement of our infrastructure. To do so we need to grid all of the various areas of our city and begin a systematic reconstruction of the infrastructure within those sections. This would include streets sidewalks water lines sewer lines and storm sewers. We would then have a map and location of all the new infrastructure and we could systematically work through the various sections of Martinsville. I plan to implement this system if elected Mayor.  What is your view of our city parks and where do they fit into your agenda?  Answer: City parks are so valuable to our citizens as they are quality of life items. We need to ensure that we have programs and activities in which our citizens can take advantage of our city parks. The image of your city can be displayed to visitors by having a nice attractive city park system. If elected Mayor I would want to ensure that we have the appropriate programming and various activities available through our park system. Currently the City does have various properties which it has identified for park expansion and we need to follow through on bringing those properties online into the park system.   OPERATIONS  What if any changes would you implement to improve transparency and accountability in city government?  Answer: I do not know what has been done in the past as I have not been a part of any city administration. What I do know is that I believe in being upfront and honest in my dealings with people. I would bring that same openness to the Mayors office. Further I believe that I need to be accountable for any and all decisions made. Harry S. Truman had a great mindset when he was president the buck stops here. I would take full responsibility for decisions made during my administration.  The city has been plagued by the perception of the good ol boy network for decades. How would you combat that perception if elected?  Answer: Again as mentioned above I have not been a part of any city administration therefore I do not know what the inner workings have been. All I can say is that I believe in dealing with people openly and honestly and I will be accountable for any and all decisions made by me. In my business I strive to deal with people with sincerity and honesty. I will bring that same openness and honesty to the Mayors office.  How do you ensure you have the most qualified city employees working for the citizens? What would your hiring process look like?  Answer: It would be my hope to have an interview process for any and all job openings available with the City. Therefore I would ask that resumes be submitted and an interview process then be conducted to ensure that we are receiving quality employees for the city.  What groups or organizations  whether in the city county or state  do you see as essential partners in moving the city forward and why?  Answer: At this point I do not know all of the individual groups or organizations which may be essential partners for our city. I do know that I want to set aside land and run the infrastructure to that land so that we can attract companies to locate in a new professional park. In order to do so there are various groups and organizations we will need to partner with. Obviously a good working relationship with Morgan County is important as well as with the State of Indiana. I will promote the City of Martinsville to the best of my ability and I will welcome help from any and all groups or organizations which share that goal.   The citys financial standing has seen good years and bad. How do you ensure the citys finances are in order and what are your top priorities for the budget?  Answer: I have been involved with running successful businesses over the course of my professional career. I will bring that same work ethic and business sense to the City. Obviously I will need to consult with financial advisors and work very closely with the City Clerk-Treasurers Office to make sure we are operating the City in the same manner that successful businesses operate. We have many challenges ahead of us as we grow and take advantage of our location in relation to I-69. Sound financial footing will be important as we tackle those challenges.  When it comes to city codes a complaint is sometimes made that theyre often inconsistent and antiquated and above all rarely enforced. What would be your approach to the citys municipal code?  Answer: We do probably have City Ordinances that need to be updated revised or repealed. It would be my position that I would work with the City Council to implement any modifications to current ordinances or to pass any new ordinances which need to be implemented. I would then be committed to put the people in place to make sure the ordinances are enforced. I do believe that part of ensuring the city operates to the best of its ability is to enforce ordinances.  How much importance do you put on professional relationships outside the city limits  vital somewhat useful unimportant? And why?  Answer: Part of running a successful business is the development and nurturing of good relationships with various individuals and organizations. I do not believe that you can put a geographical limit on these various relationships. As Mayor it would be my goal to see Martinsville be successful. To be successful various relationships will need to be made nurtured or continued. I would be committed to use my best judgment to identify those relationships and to build upon them.  While many of the decisions concerning I-69 through Martinsville have already been made how will you work with INDOT to ensure the best possible outcomes for the city both during construction and after I-69 is complete?  Answer: I will want to see what decisions have been made and what decisions are left to be made. Obviously navigating through Martinsville during construction will be a challenge. It would be my hope that we are able to work with INDOT to make that situation the best it can be and to ensure against total traffic gridlock. Obviously I would want to have an open line of communication with INDOT and would want to be a good partner with INDOT however I would want to do everything possible that would benefit Martinsville.  INDOT plans to shut down Ind. 37 for one full construction season in 2021. How will you help guide the city during this time? What do you see as top priority/ies?  Answer: See answer to question above.  Currently some city offices are spread across several locations throughout the city. What would you as mayor do about consolidating city offices?  Answer: I would like to see the results of a study to show what the best options would be for use of our current buildings vs. expansion/remodeling of current buildings vs. purchasing/ new building construction. I would love to consolidate our city offices but I want to make sure it is being done in a way that uses tax payer dollars wisely.  CHARACTER  What is one instance in which you faced an ethical dilemma and how did you resolve it?  Answer: With the nature of my business and the expectation of privacy I will abstain from this question.  What are the biggest influences in your life and why?  Answer: The largest influences in my life are and will always be my family and my faith. Growing up my parents John and Anita Costin showed me the importance of a strong work ethic and how to treat others. My wife Debbie supports and encourages me in all that I do. Our faith in the Lord guides us to make each of our decisions.  Describe a situation when you took a controversial position that angered people. How did you handle it?  Answer: During my time on the school board for the MSD of Martinsville I took a position against the installation of artificial turf. I felt that such a large monetary investment could be used for other improvements/repairs in the district at that time and staff retention due to economic downturn. I did not waiver from my position during the course of the proceedings.  Describe your firsthand experiences if any dealing with people who are different from you socially economically religiously or politically.  Answer: I work with people different than myself every single day in my business and it is often times in the worst moments of their lives. What I have learned is life is not about the differences we have- those are just things people want us to focus on. In the end no matter the differences you have with others you will find that life is about the things we have in common and that is that we all have family and friends that we love and care for that we want to be safe happy and we all want the opportunity to give our families a better life.  When it comes to being the mayor of Martinsville what excites you most about that possibility? What makes you most nervous?  Answer: I am excited about the potential this City has it is a diamond in the rough. We have the geographical advantage of being located between the States capital and one of the top Universities in the country. I am most nervous about wasting that potential we have to make sure it is not squandered and that the proper steps are taken for the City to reach its full potential. If I am elected as Mayor during the most pivotal time in our Cities history and it fails to reach its full potential that will be on me. I am not going to let that happen.  Why should voters cast a ballot for you instead of your opponent?  Answer: If I am elected Mayor the buck will stop with me. I get phone calls from families in the worst moments of their life at all hours of the day and it has been my job for over 30 years to help those families. That is going to be the standard I bring to the Office of Mayor. I have been in business since 1985 in large part because I have always worked with a realistic budget geared towards growth and making sure the families I serve come first. If I am elected Mayor I will bring this business experience and philosophy with me.",political,Facebook
Good morning Associates.  We asked you guys to participate in our collective wisdom challenge where you the community proved tips to your fellow workers/employers. After the massive response weve decided to share these insights for the entire week. These tips come from a variety of industries positions and experiences.  Sarah from Pittsburgh writes   Ive worked in Corporate America for over 34 yrs. I am proud to say Ive reached the heights of my profession in the tech space and I love it. What Ive come to discover however is this. We are afraid to share our wages with others because it may seem rude or for the sake of privacy. Ive worked at companies who had the undertones of keeping wages secret! However heres my advice. Share this type of information with your co-workers our inability to have open and honest conversations about pay allows for inequality to take place in the workforce. If we share our wages it allows us to have a voice and dismantle this notion that women shouldnt have equal pay for equal work the same as men.  #GreenandHillAssociates #CollectiveWisdomeChallenge #Staffing #Jobseekers #HiringManagers #Yourrights #FemaleEqualPay #Equality,political,Facebook
I published my first book just before the political rise of President Trump. I have been thinking about what I would have added to the book if I wrote it this year.  I did not spend a lot of time on politics in the book although I did spend a considerable number of pages on leadership and what I think it takes to be a truly effective moral leader. More on that in a bit.  Although I have voted many times I certainly would not call myself a political activist. This may partially stem from my time on active duty in the military where service members have certain restrictions regarding involvement in political activities. For example I could attend political meetings or rallies only as a spectator and not in uniform. I also couldnt make public political speeches. Partially to avoid violating any of these rules and mostly because I was pretty overworked and wasnt really interested I stayed away from political activities. The Department of Defense encouraged us to be good citizens and take full advantage of our rights especially our right to vote but we had to be careful not to create the perception that we were an official representative of the DOD and implying DOD support of a certain political party or candidate. As military members we had to be focused on following the orders of the Commander in Chief while recognizing our right to question unethical orders. This last right is actually a significant obligation. This intrinsically decent obligation was something that few soldiers in the Nazi regime seem to have considered. Sure there could be debates on whether some specific actions are ethical or not but at least our U.S. military is open to serious discussion of these questions.  Since I retired I am no longer subject to these restrictions on political activity.  I dont have to stay on the sidelines or keep quiet.  Silence is tacit agreement.  Facebook provides one avenue to voice my opinions and I decided I should take advantage of it.  To start with I cant say that I align completely with the platform of either the Republican Party or the Democratic Party. This fact may hint at part of our problem. The two party system always seems to foster (fester?) an us versus them mentality.  Some could say I have Republican leanings because I dont want to waste my hard earned money on programs that appear to be a deep hole with little effectiveness. Some say I have Democratic leanings because I think building a Wall along the Mexican board is a waste of money or because I think that we need to figure out how to reduce healthcare costs so we can make medical care available to more people. Some people may say I am more Republican because I think medical care provision should also take into consideration how people take care of themselves. For example I am not a believer on spending a lot of my money on a person born after say 1980 who smokes every day and develops lung cancer. These people should know better and I dont want to divert money from my childrens education for example to pay for some medical costs for strangers that resulted from their poor decisions. My point is you could say that I am somewhere in the middle of the road as I suspect most people are.  The unproductive and simmering us vs them attitude is further fueled by the misleading people who try to complicate their opponent Partys position by highlighting the fringe members extreme ideas and representing them as central to each Party. These diversionists then try to dismiss every idea an opposing Party comes up with simply because it is associated with the other Party.  Further complicating the political process are all-encompassing bills that cover many different legal issues. Congressional representatives may personally only agree with say 60% of the items proposed in the bill but they have to compromise and endorse an overall bill that contains things they dont agree with in order to get the items they really want. As a result these individual politicians get associated with things that they dont really support and this gets used against them by their political opponents. Compromise can be a tough pill to swallow. I do not have a solution for that except perhaps to suggest that the most controversial items should be broken out to debate separately and more thoroughly.  As I watch the growing political swirl I ask myself What do I really think about the President? What can I do? What should I do?  To answer these questions I draw upon my past experience.  I have been blessed to grow up in a hard working loving and compassionate family. I have attended some remarkably good schools served two decades in the worlds finest Navy and participated in the respected Boy Scout program.  My family and all of these institutions are based on principles of integrity and excellence that I am immensely proud of. In my book I tried to distill many of the traits that I believe are important to great leaders including as the title states basic decency common sense and passion.  President Trump certainly has passion.  I do not think the current President of the United States nor many members of Congress can claim to have many or even some of the character traits of great leaders.  I dont think these politicians would last long in the military which does not tolerate the egregious behavior displayed by many politicians in power. The President likely realized that he wouldnt make it in the military so he avoided his duty by claiming a boo boo on his foot (and then years later has the audacity to question the hero status of a Prisoners of War veteran. These politicians certainly couldnt be role models in organizations such as the Boy Scouts which are based on time honored principles and a cultural desire to be the best human beings possible. It disgusted me when the President attended a significant National Boy Scout event last year. As if he could redeem himself by trying to associate himself with such a group famously dedicated to positive values.  I believe there is so much wrong with this Presidents approach to the job that I find it hard to decide where to begin. Ill start with just a few of the behaviors that concern me greatly. My concern is for my children and the fundamental security of not only our Nation but our world.  However before I go into some of the unimpressive behaviors I want to make it clear that I first wonder if I should look past his character and behavior and focus solely on his political goals his executive orders and his ideas. Maybe this is a case where I dont have to necessarily like someone to work with them or respect their accomplishments. I freely admit that I have never been so negatively charged by any politician in my life. The intensity of my visceral reaction sometimes surprises me. Its like tens of thousands of years of evolution have wired me with a warning system that screams danger whenever I see him or listen to him talk. My mind cant even wrap around his words because nearly everything he says creates a mental dissonance for me. America was built on a commitment to values. This President has no record of championing Christian values and I believe he is actively working to destroy our American values. Our traditional values include hard work compassion for others defense of freedoms no patience for fear mongers a relatively open economy and an almost universal desire to make our country better through healthy debate with strong support for freedom of the press.  I have been fortunate to travel the world as an officer in the Navy and in other roles so I have witnessed the types of societies that are produced when news is controlled by the government. I am also a student of history and have read quite a bit about many famous and infamous leaders but it doesnt take a rocket scientist to see the connection between fascist or authoritarian leaders and their well documented attacks on the press or in extreme cases their outright removal of the right of freedom of speech. I believe our government should be extremely transparent without disclosing information that should genuinely be categorized as classified due to its importance to national security. These types of anti media leaders are fearful of losing their power and they dont like anyone who disagrees with them.  I think the Presidents claims that much of the mainstream media is Fake News is ludicrous. He seems to think that anyone who doesnt agree with him was nefariously influenced by the media. My opinions of him are almost entirely based on the words I hear come out of his mouth the actions he take and the things he doesnt take action for. I dont watch much of the mainstream media opinion shows so I wont comment on them.  Part of the concept of common sense is the idea that facts matter. I have no doubt that our President lies he distorts the truth he deflects attention away from his own behavior he distracts and he denies. He does not seem to be interested in the truth. He only appears to want to defend his position and stoke fears held by some parts of our society. He is a coward. He does not reflect on his own behavior and how his words and actions may have consequences because people are listening to him and watching him. Every good leader must exercise a significant degree of self evaluation. Good leaders know that their words have expected and unintentional effects so the words must be carefully chosen. The more power or influence a leader has the more this self reflection is required. We cant solve problems if we dont establish the facts. We need the media to help us communicate the facts as well as opinions. Nearly every problem has multiple solutions. This administration does not publicly debate the options. They like to dictate their poorly thought out approach and squash any conversations.  The President of the United States should represent the best America has to offer. He or she should be someone who strives to uphold the values our country was founded upon. That kind of person will help us continue to be great and worthy of admiration. The President doesnt have to be perfect but they should be above average. As an American who travels around the country and the world I am not proud to be associated with this President. People often ask me what I think of him. He does not reflect most of my values. He doesnt even understand that one of the things that has made our country great has been our immigrants. Our success was fueled by immigrants longing for a better life and putting in hard work once they got here.  I am a patriotic American but I am not a Nationalist. It is painfully obvious to me that we are part of a very interconnected global environment where problems in another part of the world can have a very dramatic impact on our part whether we build a wall or not whether we engage overseas or not whether we believe in global warming or not. There are a limited amount of raw resources on the planet and they are not evenly distributed. I am looking for leaders to better define the problems instead of putting band aids on the superficial wounds with the conviction that it will eradicate the underlying cancer. I am looking for leaders who are willing to help others in need and not turn a blind eye.  Lack of respect - I think the last time I dealt with people who routinely made fun of other people was somewhere around 6th or 7th grade. Our current President acts like an adolescent bully. He disrespects individual people with childish names and insults. He disrespects entire groups of people by suggesting the horrific acts of a few in the group are representative of the entire group. He disrespects our trust in government and our intelligence through his distortions and lies. I cant fathom how he became President after the infamous Hollywood Access tape revealed his vulgar comments about women. He and some of his supporters downplayed it as locker room talk. Its disgusting. I never heard anything remotely close in any locker room that I ever entered in my Navy career. I think he is simply disgusting. I have zero respect for him.  For the sake of giving him the benefit of the doubt lets say I look past his behavior that I personally consider is horrific and consider his policies and political goals.  I do not agree with most of his actions or goals including this short representative list: - Decreasing taxes for the wealthy at the expense of medical research programs and other worthwhile programs as well as the national debt. Not all taxes are bad. I also disrespect the fact that he weasled out of helping pay his own fair share of taxes. Just because he may have taken advantage of tax loopholes or his businesses did so poorly that he routinely resorted to bankruptcy doesnt absolve him of the obligation to help pay for basic services such as the military police fire protection and public education. Instead the rest of us have to pick up more of the tab. - Planning to Build a border wall - Threatening to remove birthright - Taking no action to implement responsible gun laws - Reducing funding and research for mental health - Minimizing the opioid crisis - Sending in DOD military instead of more National Guard to the border with unclear and disproportionate Rules of Engagement for a stream of refugees - Supporting foreign countries with a criminal record of human rights violations - Implementing immigration bans not based on reasonable cause - Appointing numerous unqualified people to important positions within the Federal government - Gutting our State Department and hampering our ability to develop diplomatic solutions to the many international challenges that affect us - Implementing poorly thought out tariffs - Repealing Obamacare with no real plan to address our healthcare challenges - Deny global warming and withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement - Abandon the Trans Pacific Partnership - Ending the law requiring internet service providers to respect their clients privacy  Im sure there must be some more issues I agree on with the President but only a few jump to mind. - Giving veterans more choices for commercial health care - Championing infrastructure development (though he hasnt delivered much actual work) - Rebuilding Americas Armed Forces -  This is probably because I try to distance myself as much as possible from him. I just dont want to be associated with his style or more importantly his lack of traditional American and Christian values.  I am also sure there are people that have different opinions than me about the President including good friends and family. If anyone would like to share them with me for potential inclusion in my next book please send them to me at the following email: Thomasjamesmitoraj@gmail.com. I am looking for constructive thoughtful input. I will simply ignore any emails or other comments that dont contribute to solutions or a fact based explanation of support for the President and his behavior.,political,Facebook
The U.S. Supreme Court upheld peoples First Amendment rights in AFPF v Bonta. This case brought together nearly 300 groups from a diversity of perspectives and representing a range of issues including health faith civil rights and racial justice among others. When a state makes a blanket demand for a list of an organizations supporters it creates an unacceptable risk to those peoples right to join together with one another and violates the privacy necessary to protect that right. We applaud the Court's decision and what it means for non-profits across the country and the millions of Americans who support them.  Joining forces with others whether publicly or privately has always been a key part of Americas forward march toward realizing our founding ideals. From the Federalist Papers to the Civil Rights Movement to important causes today people have banded together to demand a better way - opening the door to progress time and again. Their identities were far less important than their ideas and because they had the right to keep the former private the latter transformed America.,political,Facebook

Dan Bishop's Republicans: The Party of Enormous Government  In case you needed another reason to vote for me in this election Dan Bishop and his Republican colleagues in the North Carolina General Assembly just made it clear again that theyll ignore your privacy your liberties and your livelihood. Bishop loves talking about freedom but by sponsoring Senate Bill 315 he controls what you can put in your body.  Bishops latest barrage on his constituents freedom deals with the non-psychoactive and non-addictive medicine known as CBD. Voters need to wake up to their new ballot options because Libertarians like me unlike Bishop and Republicans believe in personal freedom.  When it comes to guns Dan knows bans are futile saying The answer from the left to issues like that seem [sic] always be to restrict rights of law-abiding people which seems implausible ineffective and contrary to the sort of basic principles of liberty that our country is built around. Why does Dan think the situation would be any different with CBD?  National polling suggests more than 84% of the country supports the legalization of medical or recreational cannabis. North Carolina slumped far behind the rest of the country even in the face of widespread humanitarian support for medicinal use. After struggling under the Trump-Tariffs our agricultural industry began reaping the benefits of hemp.  Then Dan Bishop killed the buzz. Under the bill he sponsors the 1000 licensed hemp growers and 600 registered hemp processors in North Carolina alone will have to deal with new burdensome regulations. When red tape suits their needs Republicans like Bishop are thrilled to put their boot on our necks. He doesnt care that thousands of farmers sank billions of dollars into this explosive industry. Rather than championing North Carolinas opportunity to expand into the hemp industry Bishop wants to squash small businesses and hurt farmers.  Republicans are ramming this ban of CBD through the General Assembly as quickly as they can because they know it is wildly unpopular. By sponsoring this bill Bishop is not representing District 9 voters but is joining forces with the pharmaceutical industry the police and prison-industrial complex and the alcohol industry.  Dan a pro-war fearmonger wont resist the president when you and your loved ones are sent to their death in yet another needless war but he will resist the veterans when they return home. By barring veterans personal choice when it comes to managing their pain with CBD Dan dishonors their sacrifices their medical needs and their freedom. In light of the ever-growing opioid epidemic politicians like Bishop should be looking to expand options for our veterans not on stripping them away.  Dan Bishop and Republicans took this position because the police said they cant distinguish CBD from marijuana that contains THC. Rather than listen to clear a majority of the population that prefers marijuana legalization Bishop wants to further expand prohibition. Police take advantage of the system because the ambiguity gives them wide discretion. There are many examples of people who legally obtained CBD criminally charged for possessing marijuana. Some are charged with DUIs despite CBD containing nothing that gets you high.  Dan doesnt care about the new commercial ventures that free imaginative people can start. He doesnt care about your values and the initiative to make your life better. Instead he cares about legislating your morality and picking who wins and who loses in the market.  Remember the next time a Republican like Dan Bishop says I stand for small government there is nothing to back it up. From Bathroom Bills to CBD Bans Republicans think their morals and decision making abilities are superior to those of their constituents. Obey my morality or pay a $2500 fine.  This September you can vote for the only candidate that stands for limited government. Dont accept a Republican bullying you over your medical and economic needs. Make the sane choice not the same choice.  Jeff Scott for Congress,political,Facebook
I would like to take a moment to share 2 stories of client impact in our community that explain exactly what we do everyday for members of our community. These people may be your friends your neighbors members of your family or the person next to you on the street. Please help us continue this extremely important service to our community and donate today. Any amount will help. Peace & Blessings Jennifer G. Kierstead CEO  Mary is a client we met at an outreach function. She did not have transportation and had attended the event because a friend invited her and drove her there. We spoke about the benefits she would potentially be eligible for including SNAP AHCCCS MSP and potential referrals to other agencies. Mary is one of the most skeptical clients we have ever encountered. We gave her an overview of the process and eligibility requirements as well as flyers pamphlets and encouraged her to come to the office. The day she finally came to the office she was extremely frightful of giving us any information and questioned every step of the process. We gave her privacy treated her with respect and took the time to explain everything to her. She decided to apply and was determined eligible for SNAP (food stamps) AHCCCS (Medicaid) and QMB (Qualified Medicare Beneficiary-subsidizes Medicare costs). Mary was tearfully greatful of the difference these programs made in her life. Acquiring these programs allowed Mary to have better access to food and healthcare which have improved her overall quality of life significantly.   Betty is client in her 80s living at home and caring for herself and her disabled adult son. Betty and her son consistently struggle to meet their daily living expenses their only source of income being Social Security benefits. Due to the circumstances Betty was not able to come to the local office to apply for benefits we went out and did a home visit. During our home visit it was evident Betty and her son needed some urgent assistance. We brought the tools to help them apply for Emergency SNAP benefits as well as AHCCCS/MSP in their home. The household was determined eligible for the emergency benefits by the State due to their dire needs. They were able to receive their benefits in less than a week. We were also able to refer Betty and her son to other agencies to assist them with additional programs.,political,Facebook
My stance on body cameras has been twisted and misrepresented. Let me take time to explain my stance. It is not that I wont allow our deputies to wear body cameras. The fact is I have to be a good steward of the tax payers dollars. Agencies are shelving their body cameras due to cost privacy issues and reliability. Just recently NYPD just recalled 3000 body cameras because one caught on fire. Until studies prove that crime is reduced because of body cameras being worn I may consider. The fact is citizens of Bernalillo County are fed up with crime and fed up with being victimized. I have priorities for the Bernalillo County Sheriffs Office. The citizens of our great county deserve well trained and equipped deputies to respond to their needs. I have deputies that do not have radio coverage in the east mountains. That is a very concerning issue for me. I need a much needed raise for our deputies who go out and risk their lives every single day. I have deputies that are driving patrol cars that have over 120k miles and I question their road worthiness. I would like more deputies so I could place in every elementary school in order to keep our children safe. It is a budget issue and if the county has available funding I would focus on our priorities first. In addition I support dash cameras and have started implementing them within certain units. Body cameras have been sold as a silver-bullet solution a newfangled quick fix to cure policing of its public trust deficit. Instead our deputy behaviors will continue to be shaped most by recruitment selection and the training they receive.,political,Facebook

It is now TIME to Strap-On your IMAGINATION Astronaut Helmet as the End Game enters its Final Stages. Most of the story has already been written through updates emailed to others. For the Reader to Play You Be the Judge a TIME-Line will be used. Excerpts in some cases will be used as permitted. If you are ready YOU BE THE JUDGE.  How many of you reading this have ever represented yourself or another party in the Court of Law? Previously during Nicks senior year in high school my Feet had to represent Nick as a parent to request a Temporary Restraining Order or TRO in the Henderson NV. Civil Court. This was the result of Nicks Mugging by two thugs outside of Nicks House. The TRO was approved followed by another PRO for the length of one year. Henderson Civil Courts with Judge Rodney Burr provided a couple of minor league games to prepare my Feet for the 8th District Court Clark County Nevada.  The CCSD with the use of taxpayers dollars decided to file a Motion to Dismiss my Complaint for a Temporary Injunction to defend their Business Relationship with Scott Baker and the Southern Blue Sox Private Baseball Company operating on the campus of Basic Academy/HS in Henderson NV. This Motion was 12 pages and it resembled a White Woolly Mammoth defined with prehistoric legal terms that did not relate to the LIFE of my Feet in the year of 2019. Question How does One eat a White Woolly Mammoth? Answer One Bite at a TIME. The Irony of this End Game was that the CCSD was using the Tax Dollars of my Feet to defend their Business Relationship with Scott Baker and the Southern Nevada Blue Sox Private Baseball Company.  The Clark County School District is the 5th largest public school district in the USA with the 5th largest Legal Team in the USA public schools to PLAY against my Feet in the End Game. My Feet are represented by my Small Town West Aliquippa Pa. Legal Team of One Butt. Stories and Fables are abound of outnumbered Butts on the Side of RIGHT rising to the occasion and vanquishing Wrong. From afar One could compare the End Game as David vs. Goliath. All my Feet could do to counter the Motion to Dismiss was have my Legal Team of One Butt submit an Opposition to the Motion to Dismiss.  After chewing the White Woolly Mammoth one bite at a TIME a 11 page Opposition was submitted to the Courts. For Dessert a 12 page Motion for Additions was filed with the Courts that were granted a Court Date. In the Defense Motion to Dismiss evidence was presented that a Business Relationship had been formed between the CCSD and Scott Baker and the Southern Nevada Blue Sox Private Baseball Company since 2010-11. This Business Relationship would be used to mount a counter-attack on the CCSD. Next is a letter to the 4 Musketeers describing the day of the Motion to Dismiss Hearing on 3/4/19.  3/4/19  To the 4 Musketeers  RESULTS FROM THE COURTROOM OF JUDGE JOE HARDY JR  As preparations were being made this morning for the visit to the Court Offerings of Encouragement and Blessings greeted My Butt & 2 Brains (MB&2B) starting around 6 AM. Encouragements came in the way of Backdoor Messages from My 2 Angels of INSANITY The Cellobat and God is My Judge AKA Passion & Compassion. Our Relationship has permitted MB&2B to name certain items around the Dream Home in the Honor of Passion & Compassion. For example the Outdoor Fountain that greets guests has two names in Honor of Passion. One is the Cellobat Fountain or the Fabled Cello of the American West Fountain.  The fountain in the backyard is called the God is My Judge Fountain in Honor of Compassion. Each morning as today MB&2B is always greeted by the Cellobat Fountain on the way for the daily paper. Then usually my attention is turned to the backyard fountain while preparing for the morning. It was obvious that the timing mechanism was affected by the recent wet weather for it had still not turned on. After a manual adjustment to set the correct TIME the God is My Judge Fountain began to operate. MB&2B continued to observe the filling of the fountain from the back porch.  A Blessing then appeared in the form of Nick Hummingbird. Nick Hummingbird and I share a Spiritual Relationship that began after Nicks Physical Passing from this planet. His documented visits are Legendary with some caught on camera and video. Another story for another TIME. Nick Hummingbird buzzed around the GIMJ Fountain as it continued to fill. MB&2B immediately declared it as a Blessing from Nick. Eventually Nick Hummingbird perched on the edge of the fountain. He then started to perform a Bird Bath Dance. The Dance went on for over a minute. Then Nick Hummingbird buzzed off leaving his Blessings behind.  As the morning continued an email reply came to my cellphone from #12. He was privy to receive the previous email that was sent to the 4 Musketeers the day before. He offered the following Words of Encouragement for he represents the Class of 69 and all of Quiptown.  #50 Thanks for the update. Your intended Opening Statement is respectful well-written and factual. I think the Judge is obligated to render his opinion based on legal precedent - not the obvious immorality and improprieties of your opponents glaring offenses so yes the outcome is unpredictable but I wonder what the Judge has to lose (NOTHING in my opinion) by granting a continuance to enable the introduction of additional evidence. Good luck my friend. I am in your corner.  #12  As MB&2B walked off the elevator to courtroom 11 the only KNOWN thing was this. In my pocket and on my cellphone My 2 Angels of INSANITY would offer their Encouragement along with the Words of #12 and all the FANTASTIC Good Energies that others have shared. The monitor screen verified the correct TIME and date for the hearing. Then after a few minutes the doors opened and the check-ins followed. The batting order was not revealed until the court called out MB&2B batting third. The name Judge Joe Hardy Jr. had a familiar ring to it. For during my TIME at Garrett JHS in Boulder City a student of mine named Joe Hardy Jr. excelled in my Physical Education Class in the early 80s or later. The Joe Hardy that I remembered was not a Gifted Athlete. However he bought into one of the many mottos that were created by MB&2B.  The Motto Read BE THE VERY BEST YOU CAN BE. Joe Hardys drive and determination earned him numerous awards in Physical Education class. During my TIME at Garrett Physical Fitness was stressed with the Blessings of the Principal and the community. This support led to the creation of an Obstacle Course the only one in the CCSD. Joe Hardy Jr. earned Conqueror of the Obstacle Course T-Shirts and Certificates indicating that he ranked among the VERY BEST. He added to his collection numerous Excellence in Physical Fitness T-Shirts and Certificates signifying that he ranked among the VERY BEST. As an A student his citizenship earned him an E which qualified him for more recognition as the VERY BEST.  Judge Joe leads off the hearing as MB&2B are sitting at the Plaintiffs table. After reading a few legal matters he then directs a question at MB&2B. It went something like this. Are you the Mr. Feher that taught Physical Education at Garrett JHS in Boulder City? MB&2B replied Yes I am your Honor. I had the privilege of opening up the school in 1979. Judge Joe continued talking to the court and declared he was a previous student of mine and that since this episode occurred about 30 years ago it should have no legal bearings on the case. The attorney for the defense agreed.  Judge Joe said that he had read the Motion to Dismiss and the Opposition for the Motion to Dismiss. He also acknowledged the Motion for Additions with the court date. After finishing the defense went first and argued for the Motion to Dismiss. When she completed Judge Joe asked if I cared to respond. My FEET stood up and out came the words My Opposition for the Motion to Dismiss speaks for itself. Then MA&2B read the next prepared statement.  Your Honor my name is George Feher and my roles in this case as the Plaintiff Attorney for the Plaintiff and as a taxpayer are dwarfed by my role as an Advocate for the children and families that reside in the Basic Academy/High School zone in Henderson NV. Regardless of the courts decision my school tax dollars will not be affected. However the courts decision will cast either a Positive Effect or a Negative Effect on the children and families that reside in the Basic Academy/High School zone.  As an Advocate for the children and families that reside in the Basic Academy/High School zone that are unable for various reasons to represent themselves it has been an honor and a privilege to serve and represent the past children and families of the Basic Academy/High zone the present children and families of the Basic Academy/High School zone and the future children and families of the Basic Academy/High School zone. Before your Honor continues with todays Motion to Dismiss recent evidence introduced in the Defendants Motion to Dismiss has set the stage for the court to hear our plea.  After over three and half years of correspondence with the Clark County School District in regards to this matter before you the Clark County School District did not ever respond to my writings that questioned the Clark County School Districts relationship with Scott Baker and the Southern Nevada Bluesox Private Baseball Company on the campus of Basic Academy/HS as stated on page 8 of 12 lines 21-23 in the Motion to Dismiss. SILENCE was their tactic. This lack of legal information has had a negative legal effect on my Complaint for a Temporary Injunction. The Defendants did not ACT in GOOD FAITH in over three and a half years.  Because of this Lack of GOOD FAITH the Plaintiff requests a delay in todays Motion to Dismiss so that the Court can hear the Plaintiffs Motion for Additions on Monday March 25 2019 at 9 AM in the same courtroom. These Additions which are based on the new evidence will support the Plaintiffs request for a Temporary Injunction.  I thank you for your TIME your Honor.  After completing the verbal pleas MB&2B sat down. Judge Joe then permitted a rebuttal from the defense attorney. After she was done Judge Joe then proceeded to cast his ruling. Out from his mouth the first Motions that he mentions are the Opposition and Addition. His words expressed a possible lean in the direction of MB&2B. Then it became clear as his words shifted to a lean to the defense. The dialogue between him and the defense attorney who was Melissa was spoken in a Foreign Tongue. It did not compute in MB&2B. After the Murky Waters cleared Judge Joe renders his decision.  Judge Joe agreed with the defense that the original Complaint did not meet the standards of the Nevada Courts. However he then said that because of the other information presented to him an extension should be granted to MB&2B to file an Amended Complaint. He then directed the defense attorney in Foreign Tongues to draw up an order that needed my approval. He gave her a few days for the task. Judge Joe then asked if MB&2B would be leaving the country or going out of town in the near future. I responded No. He then ruled that MB&2B had 14 days to file an Amended Complaint. He asked if that would work and I said yes.  As my case was winding down and officially off the record MB&2B made an announcement to the court. I said I remember Judge Hardy as a student. He was an Outstanding Student. Plus by looking at his Physical Fitness he must have learned something. Judge Joe and the others laughed. Question how does an Outstanding Student who Blest my Physical Education Class now reside as the Judge in my case against the CCSD?  After you answer that question then perhaps your HELP can be extended in another request. The prudent and proper thing to do now with this Second Chance is to pay a reasonable fee to an attorney for Unbundled Services for my GUT & RADAR indicates the Judge Joe sees some merit in my case. If not he could have ruled for the defense but he chose Second Chance. In order for this Second Chance to obtain the results from the case for the children and families in the Basic Academy/HS zone it has be done LEGALLY CORRECT.  MB&2B is opened for suggestions to add to the ideas that pop into My IMAGINATION.  * Melissa in her last letter mentioned employee contracts with the CCSD. She also mentioned the same in court. It was a vague announcement about Teachers Contract and the contract of other personnel. Tomorrow MB&2B will do some research on the employment status of Scott Baker with the CCSD. If need be public records from the CCSD will be requested that legally demonstrates the contracts.  * Judge Joe said that he could not offer legal advice in the Amended Complaint. MB&2B interpreted that as GO FIND LEGAL HELP.  * Again please check any local attorney sources within your circle who may be interested in HELPING a WORTHY CAUSE while earning a Reasonable Fee.  * After this email my next visit is to the NV. Bar Org. to seek HELP FOR A WORTHY CAUSE.  George (End of Letter)  My 2 Angels of INSANITY #12 Queen Noir Nightingale and Sir Charles received various forms of this letter. On Tuesday 3/5/19 a Game Plan was devised. The CCSD Public Records Division was sent an email to verify the CCSD Business Relationship with Scott Baker and the Southern NV Blue Sox. Following the advice of Judge Joe emails requesting Legal HELP were sent to the following: 2 Education Law School Professors at Boyd Law School UNLV. As of this writing NO RESPONSE. An attorney from the NV. Bar Org. returned my Call for HELP on Wednesday 3/6/19. The request did not meet the Firms legal area of expertise and three other attorneys were recommended. All three attorneys were contacted by either email and/or phone. However their responses mirrored those of the UNLV Professors.  More Flares for HELP were sent out to others including two paralegals. When the paralegals heard that the Defendants were the CCSD both advised my Feet to get an attorney. Following the Wisdom of #12 Batters that were currently are and in the future that would be negatively affected by the BULLY Fees of Scott Baker had to be tracked down. Their Willing Presence as Batters in the line-up as possible Plaintiffs could alter the direction of the Court Case. Emails text messages and letters were sent out into the community including the Henderson Little League Board Members for Batters and their Families to Step-Up to the Plate in the Game of RIGHT vs. Wrong.  Since the Legal Cavalry showed no evidence of arriving in TIME Smoke Signals indicated that the Legal Team of One Butt would write the Amended Complaint for a Temporary Injunction. With Sunday 3/17/19 at 4pm a deadline for Batters/Families to be added as possible Plaintiffs the ACTI was written molded and shaped to the VERY BEST Legal Standards by the Legal Team of One Butt. Once completed and filed on Monday 3/18/19 the Courts would rule.  The following is a letter to Queen Noir Nightingale and Sir Charles. Though dated 3/19/19 it was emailed on Sunday evening 3/24/19.  3/19/19  Queen Noir Nightingale & Sir Charles  The Enchanted Forest in the Piazza Lounge as usual created Blessings Energies & Gifts on the 18th Monday of March 2019. As my words appear may they carry my sentiments of GRATITUDE your way. The Sound Tech commented on my absence the past couple of weeks as we shared our words early in the night. My Confession spoke of an Addiction for the Enchanted Forest during the reasons given for my previous absences. I explained that QNN & SC were sent emails of my Missing of the Blessings requesting an Excused Absence. The Sound Tech laughed and said welcome back. As stated before these Blessings began back in the Summer of 2016.  The Wonderment of the Blessings varies during each visit to the EF. Monday Night was no exception for the Blessings took My BUTT & 2 Brains on a Cruise of the Past. This Cruise was triggered by the Authenticity and Honesty of Queen Noir Nightingale and her Court plus others that were among the creatures that roamed the EF that night. Hal Urban in his book Lifes Greatest Lessons writes;  In the previous chapter I said that respect was the foundation upon which good people build their lives. The cornerstone the first and most indispensable piece of that foundation is honesty. Its respect in its highest form. Hal admits that he did not practice the Virtue of Honesty on a regular basis. Like others his attitude was everybodys doing it for somehow being a little bit dishonest was OK. He further explains his one thing he would Pass On To Others. If you genuinely want to succeed in life honesty isnt just the best policy; its the only policy.  The key to being or becoming an honest person lies in understanding the meaning of integrity and its relationship to honesty. The two words are used interchangeably but integrity is a broader term. In regard to human nature it means being complete. It comes from the word integral which means whole or undivided. Its defined in Merriam-Websters New Collegiate Dictionary Ninth Edition as essential to completeness. To have integrity is be a complete person-honest and with consistently high moral standards. To live without integrity is to be an incomplete human being.  Hal continues to share the Struggles of Honesty and if left unattended these Struggles usually develop a shortcut philosophy of life. Hal writes Without realizing it we become morally lazy. Its easier and quicker to be dishonest. Hal tells us that this Dishonesty is with both others and Oneself. There is also a Cost of Dishonesty which includes:  * William James great psychologist/philosopher wrote that we create our own hell in this world by habitually fashioning our characters in the wrong way. Most dishonest behavior is at the very root of most of ones psychological problems and the relationship between ones values and ones health.  * Dishonesty is a vicious circle. * Dishonesty turns us into phonies and manipulators. * Dishonesty eventually catches up with us. * Dishonesty cant be hidden. * Dishonesty ruins relationships. * Dishonesty attacks our nervous system * Dishonesty prevents us from fulfillment and becomes roadblocks to our growth and development.  On the other hand if one practices Honesty all the TIME regardless of the results Hal praises Six Reasons For Being Honest.  * Peace of Mind. * Character and Reputation-Honesty is a Habit that One can practice All of the TIME. * Relationships-The most essential ingredient of a good relationship is trust.

Or your fingers can click on the Attachment Amended Complaint and your senses can play You Be the Judge. Judge Joe and his legal team will review the Amended Complaint in Chambers on April 29 2019 without legal reps for the Plaintiff (thats me) and the Defendants (the CCSD). However in the exchange of the Amended Complaint to Melissa which was mailed on Tuesday 3/19/19 another mention of the Deal was included.  Not one Local Batter/Family stepped up to the plate. (Story for another TIME) However 13 SLUGGERS from the Nevada Revised Statutes and CCSD Policy/Regulations round out the Line-Up. Judge Joe and his Legal Team will decide the legal merits of each SLUGGER. If one or more of the SLUGGERS advance to base then Judge Joe will rule that the Game of RIGHT vs Wrong can continue. If the SLUGGERS produce no legal merits then the Game of RIGHT vs Wrong is over and Judge Joe will issue his legal reasoning. Until such TIME and since MB&2B is a Rookie Manager the legal rules are UNKNOWN. Countermoves may or may not be submitted to the Court by the Defense.

A Friend (#12) of the Plaintiffs writes: Baseball played a very important role in my maturation process. From the age of 9 when I joined my first Little League team participation in team sports enabled and promoted the development of my essential life skills like preparation cooperation teamwork generosity and humility. Fortunately access to team sports was FREE in my town because my Father - an immigrant to this country and a high school drop-out - was not financially equipped to provide such luxuries. If a participation fee had been charged I would have become a spectator instead of an enthusiastic player and the critical lessons I learned would have eluded me completely. Spectators seldom acquire the equivalent levels of friendship dedication and commitment shared by players. In short I would have been unfairly deprived of the qualities that have defined my life happiness and success. I am saddened to know that access to team sports IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS is limited to ONLY those who can afford it in Henderson NV because that form of discrimination is unfair inappropriate and contrary to the freedoms I hold dear. I wholeheartedly support your quest for justice and your advocacy for those members of your community who cannot afford to participate.  Heres wishing you the strength and endurance you will need to confront a well-oiled and better equipped machine. May your faith tenacity and preparation enable the same outcome David realized in his conflict with Goliath. Your opponent is daunting but your mission is admirable and worthy. Good luck!

Recently MB&2B had more KNOWINGS and was written and shared with others in a story titled The Enchanted Forest-3-18-19. Excerpts include:  During a series of text messages the past few weeks with the 2019 Spring ARTWORK attached the theme was The Quest for the TRUTHS of Danigirl & Batgirl. It was done with the intent to demonstrate inconsistencies in the TRUTHS of their Relationships with others including with Oneself. Especially since Danigirl Royalty raised the bar of her relationship with her boy-toy to that of a fianc and Batgirl publicly announced her 2  plus years boy-toy relationship.  It was near the end of the legal writing that MB&2B read Hal Urban and his thoughts on INTEGRITY and HONESTY. On Saturday night March 16 2019 the chapter was shared with Compassion & Passion thru a series of text messages along with the personal discourse of MB&2B. The reason being is that Danigirl and I have been Word Sparring since 2013 and she is the only person on the planet to have read all of my stories on my website and Facebook page plus personal writings. Batgirl is a distant second but far ahead of third.  The Vixen(?) Angels were the first contacts after returning from the courthouse. The following are excerpts of the letter.  3/18/19 2:45 PM  The Vixen Angels(?)  Before leaving to file my Legal Case a check of Backdoor Messages was called for. A Message appeared from the Vixen Angels. Now whether this Message was sent by the Original Vixen Angels (OVA) only Danielle & Sarah would KNOW.  The Message was greeted with GRATITUDE from whatever Force sent it. However the Level of HONESTY was not KNOWN. During the process of completing the Amended T.I. the 2 Original Vixen Angels in various Images plus the 2019 Spring ARTWORK assisted. After the Discourse of Honesty and sleep a Revelation occurred while finishing the A.T.I.. This Revelation said to Continue My Quest with or without Batters. If Batters/Families wanted to PLAY Great! If Not the sign would read PLAY as ONE which would signal FANTASTIC.  The 2019 Spring ARTWORK which is attached was used for Wisdom Guidance Inspiration & Stimulation. It was displayed on the Big Screen TV. An Added Degree of HONESTY shines when the ARTWORK is shown on a Big Screen. It is suggested that Danielle views the ARTWORK with her fianc and that Sarah views the ARTWORK with her boy-toy. If both couples can party together this party would provide the HONESTY Party Atmosphere for the relationships.  This Added Degree of HONESTY is a result of various TRUTHS/KNOWINGS.  * George N. Feher created the ARTWORK with INTEGRITY & HONOR  * The INTEGRITY & HONOR of the ARTWORK has been accepted and approved by Danielle and Sarah indicated by their continuing Backdoor and Cryptic Messages. At what level of INTEGRITY & HONOR only Danielle & Sarah would KNOW.  Please accept the 2019 Spring ARTWORK as a GIFT for the contributions of the 2 OVA. This Special Edition has been captioned. A copy of the A.T.I. is also attached. With plenty of college hoops to entertain MB&2B this week perhaps TIME Forces and Signals will direct the angle of PLAY with the 2 OVA within the Dream Newsletter #14.  May DREAMS of GOOD HEALTH & GOOD FORTUNE always enter your sleep. Until our Roads Intersect.  With INSANITY Your Man-Friend George (End of Letter to OVA)  During the last series of text messages from the Discourse. Relationships INTEGRITY & HONOR were emphasized. It was noted by MB&2B that the level of I & H practiced by Danigirl & Batgirl with their relationships including with each other and Oneself had gaps of INCONSISTENCIES. MB&2B KNOWS of the boy-toy and the fianc. However the fianc and boy-toy KNOW nothing of My Relationship with Danielle and/or Sarah.

To all citizens of Carroll County  The Life Center of Galax is looking to purchase and move to the old Training Center in Woodlawn.  Training Center Tax value $9+ million with 98+/- acres and buildings. State is selling for ridiculous $4 million or best offer very quietly.  The Life Center is a drug/addiction treatment facility in downtown Galax.  It is our understanding that the people coming for drug treatment to the facility will mostly be doing so as part of a Prison sentence drug court deferment program. ( you either go to jail for your crimes or rehab if youre blaming the drugs)  We here in Carroll County support treatment and people getting help. Only requesting from Facility that it be privacy fenced and secured with minimum of two 24 hour security guards each 8 hour shift to cover the 95 acres and hundreds of patients as well as not cost our County unreasonable tax burdens.  That being said we have all heard of the serious problems that the surrounding community in Galax has had to endure because of this facility being located in a residential area.  The facility in Galax has some 400-500 911 Emergency Police and EMS calls to their locations every year. The Training Center in Woodlawn would accommodate 10 times as many people therefore a realistic expectation of several thousands of 911 Police and EMS calls per year.  Our understanding from the chief of police in Galax are these calls include theft weapons drug possession assault stolen property trespassing breaking and entering drug dealing stolen property credit card fraud just to name a few.  This could possibly crush our local 911 call center leaving citizens all over Carroll County without Police or EMS available in our time of need because they are tied up at the Woodlawn drug treatment facility. This volume of expected calls would also create a burden on our local government financially which would raise our taxes while the drug treatment facility clears millions of dollars in profits.  The citizens of Carroll county need to make their feelings known to the board of supervisors that if any facility locating in Carroll that is known to have these type problems already happening be either zoned to non residential areas with conditions or prohibited in the county. ( if the board of supervisors can create an ordinance against fortune tellers then surely this is a no brainer)  Board of Supervisors meeting is December 13th 2021 at 6pm on the second floor of the Carroll County Courthouse Complex.,political,Facebook
No Time for Apathy - Charlie's Soapbox 9/17/18  If this piece is going to have any impact it cannot be viewed through partisan eyes conservative liberal Republican Democrat. Preconceived political prejudice and implacable attitudes must be cast aside. For the moment we must view the political system as just that a political system without the personalities and policies we loath or the blind loyalty we show for one side and the blind hatred that we feel for the other.  What I will attempt to say in the next few paragraphs are the very deep and profound feelings of my heart fostered by my abiding love for this country and is not written for the purpose of casting aspersions on any political party but on individuals who regardless of their party affiliation are engaged in a power grab the likes of which has never taken place in this nation.  Our founders by virtue of the Constitution the Bill Of Rights and other federal papers tried to set up our government to include checks and balances to prevent any one person or group from accumulating enough power to become a dictatorial entity free elections limits on presidential terms of office and so on.  They gave us three branches of government the legislative branch to create and pass legislation and limit the powers of the president and the Supreme Court to interpret the meaning and intent of their writings and have the final word on how the legislation affirmed or disaffirmed the constitution.  Government agencies were to serve all the people equally to give preferential treatment to none and were never meant to be politicized for the use of the executive or any other branch to further political agendas or personal vendettas.  Im firmly convinced in my heart that America has been and still is in the throes of a bloodless revolution an attempt to subvert government agencies and resources to take away individual privacy to create an unbeatable voting base to regulate medical care education media coverage gun control and authority over every aspect of life in America.  When it was brought to light a couple of years ago that the Internal Revenue Service had been subverted and used against right-wing political activist groups Congress was all a titter. Lois Lerner took the Fifth and for all intents and purposes that was the end of it.  Although the Republicans control both houses of Congress neither body has undertaken the task of digging out the rot amongst the rank and file and identifying the upper echelon who ordered it.  It is obvious that the Federal Bureau of Investigation has been politicized and the awesome power of this feared organization has been subverted. They have supported lies used false documents to initiate a special counsel interrupted the lives of American Patriots who gave up defending themselves because it is impossible to outlast a government agency who can use taxpayer money to keep you in court for as long as they want to.  The Justice Department which has basically been leaderless under the tenure of Jeff Sessions has under the feckless interim directorship of Rod Rosenstein definitely listed to port and been complicit in obtaining FISA Court warrants under false pretenses.  Had everything gone according to plan Hillary Clinton would have been elected all the corruption would have been buried way down deep two more ultraliberal rubber stamp Supreme Court Justices would have been appointed the borders completely opened up a method developed for giving citizenship and therefore voting rights to undocumented immigrants and our government would have turned into a one-party monopoly without any way to defeat it.  Guns would have eventually been confiscated tax cuts never passed the military gutted coal mining banned domestic fracking and petroleum exploration abandoned and business killing  federal restrictions put in force entitlements would balloon the national debt would double. Triple and eventually cause the kind of inflation we cant even imagine.  The American dollar would have ceased to be the official trading currency around the world and America would have to buy whatever the preferred currency would be to pay for imports environmental groups would have finagled legislation that would make farming unprofitable abortion mills would have become as common as fast food restaurants and religious rights would have been severely curtailed.  Socialized medicine would have crippled the finest medical care in the world and there would have been a federal bureaucracy to regulate every facet of life and education would have been tailored to raise a generation of sheep who were taught that America is the cause of all the worlds problems and carbon credits would have driven fuel prices out of sight.  Do you think this couldnt happen?  Best think again.  Part of what I have written is theoretical but imagine a one-party government with a lock on every foreseeable election the aims and declarations of the parties involved and follow it to its logical conclusion.  Scary thoughts.  What do you think?  Pray for our troops our police and the peace of Jerusalem.  God Bless America  Charlie Daniels,political,Facebook
Note: Very long article about voter suppression. Please read. Give this to anyone who makes noises about voter fraud.  The 200-Year History of Using Voter Fraud Fears to Block Access to the Ballot It didnt start with Donald Trump. PEMA LEVY JANUARY 3 2019 6:00 AM  It seemed inevitable after evidence of voting irregularities appeared in the contested race in North Carolinas 9th Congressional District: Republicans used the problems to push for tighter voting laws last month. Voting restrictions in the name of fraud prevention have been at the forefront of Donald Trumps presidency ever since he claimed in the wake of his election that millions of fraudulent votes had been cast against him and he created a commission to investigate voter fraud. (Never mind that the commission failed to document any evidence of widespread fraud or that North Carolinas issues appeared to stem from impropriety on the part of the Republican candidates campaign not voters.)  But raising fears of fraud in order to make it harder for peopleparticularly people fitting certain demographic profilesto vote didnt start with this administration or even in the past 100 years. As Harvard University historian Alexander Keyssar lays out in his 2000 book The Right to Vote: The Contested History of Democracy in the United States the tactic dates back to the early decades of the 19th century. Throughout US history politicians and activists ginned up stories about fraud in order to keep their opponents from the polls. Legislative debates were sprinkled heavily with tales of ballot box stuffing miscounts hordes of immigrants lined up to vote as the machine instructed men trooping from precinct to precinct to vote early and often he writes.  The most pervasive fraud that was actually occurring in the late 19th century was in the South where African Americans were denied the right to vote through vigilante violence and ballot manipulation. We are a majority here a black man from Georgia testified to the Senate in 1883 but you may vote till your eyes drop out or your tongue drops out and you cant count your colored man in out of them boxes; theres a hole gets in the bottom of the boxes some way and lets out our votes. The unfolding scandal in North Carolina where it appears African American voters were the victims certainly fits with the long tradition with trying to suppress the black vote in the South Keyssar tells Mother Jones.  In the late 19th century white Southerners began to realize that the easiest way to disenfranchise African Americans was through legal means like poll taxes and literacy tests. Meanwhile fear of widespread voter fraud prompted restrictions on voting around the country often employed to hinder immigrants minorities and poor and working-class voters. Heres an incomplete timeline of using the specter of fraud to deny people the vote:  1836: Pennsylvania passed its first voter registration law. The law applied only to Philadelphia where it required assessors to go door-to-door to compile a list of eligible voters. To cast a ballot a voter had to be on the list. Although the proclaimed goal of the law was to reduce fraud opponents insisted that its real intent was to reduce the participation of the poorwho were frequently not home when the assessors came by and did not have big brass nameplates on their doors Keyssar writes.  1866: California passed a restrictive registration requirement aimed at quelling fears about voter fraud committed by immigrants. Democrats considered it an act of hostility to the Democratic party. To register naturalized citizens had to present to the county clerk their original court-sealed naturalization papers Keyssar explains. In the absence of such papers an immigrants eligibility could be established only through the testimony of two householders and legal voters and by residence in the state for a full year double the normal requirement. The deadline to register was three months before the general election.  1866-1867: New Jersey Republicans erected a series of hurdles under the pretense of fighting fraud. Everyone who wished to cast a ballot had to register in person the Thursday before each general election; anyone could challenge the credentials of a would-be registrant; and anyone not on the list on Election Day could not vote. Democrats protested that the laws discriminated against the poor who couldnt take time off work to register. These registration laws varied in the ensuing decades with Democrats repealing them when in power and Republicans reinstating them upon taking control. Republicans also passed laws to close the polls at sunset based on the assumption that illegal votes would be cast after dark. Democrats countered that these sunset laws blocked workers from voting.  Early 1880s: Chicagos elite losing power to Democratic politicians began to advocate reforms to preserve the purity of the ballot box including a burdensome registration system. At the same time they set out to discover evidence of fraud to boost their reform agenda. They hired investigators to monitor polling locations and offered a $300 reward to anyone who helped in the apprehension and conviction of anyone who voted illegally in Chicago in 1883. The allegedly illegal voters the effort produced were acquitted in court.  1885: Despite a lack of evidence of fraud Illinois enacted a new voter registration system drafted by the states elites. Under these reforms voters in some cities were required to register in person on the third or fourth Tuesday before a general election. Election clerks accompanied by the police would then conduct a house-by-house canvass of every would-be voter and create a suspect list of anyone potentially registered improperly. Anyone on this suspect list would not be eligible to vote unless he appeared on the Tuesday two weeks prior to a general election with convincing evidence of his eligibility. This entire process would be repeated every four years. The Chicago elites celebrated that the foundations for honest elections were now firmly laid.  1911: New Jersey in a Progressive Era effort to squash corruption erected major hurdles to voter registration but only in cities of more than 5000 people. Whenever a voter moved or sat out an election he had to re-register. Registration was available only four days per year and the registration process required a prospective voter to list his occupation and the names of his spouse parents and landlord as well as a satisfactory description of the dwelling in which he lived as Keyssar describes it. Turnout plummeted especially among African Americans and immigrants.  Mid-late-20th century: Voter purges and administrative barriers to registration persisted contributing to chronically low turnout in the United States compared to other Western democracies. When voting rights advocates successfully pressed Congress to pass a bill to relax registration rules in 1992 former President George H.W. Bush vetoed it calling the bill an open invitation to fraud and corruption.  2010-present: Republicans who took control of state governments across the country after the 2010 elections passed a rash of restrictive voting laws as anti-fraud measures. These reforms included voter identification laws restrictions on early voting and requirements that people provide proof of citizenship to register. They have done little to stamp out in-person voter fraud which is virtually nonexistent. But they do impede voters of color the poor the elderly and young people from casting ballots. A federal appeals court found in 2016 that North Carolinas voter ID requirements target African Americans with almost surgical precision. A federal court in Texas ruled in 2017 that the states voter ID law passed under the pretense of fraud deterrence purposefully discriminated against African Americans and Latinos.

My name is Tim Huttner. Ive lived in Champlin for 30 years. Im running for ward1 because I believe the city of Champlin needs leadership that brings new ideas and a can-do attitude.

As a local business owner and employer I have 30 years experience in weathering economic ups and downs and a proven track record of innovation and getting things done. As a current member of the Economic Development Authority in neighboring Dayton Ive worked in concert with that city council and the community to promote economic growth and retain businesses. Im an educated technician and patented inventor working with industry in the high-performance automotive and computer field. I look for and appreciate the talents of other people and work to promote good ideas. Im all about getting creative solving problems and serving people.

In September the Biden Administration proposed a new rule that would expand the IRSs data collection on millions of Americans. The rule would require financial institutions and other financial service providers to report all inflows and outflows on accounts that have more than $600. This proposal would be a huge privacy issue for Americans and create an expensive undue burden on our local banks and credit unions.  Here are 5 ways that you could find yourself surveilled by the agency:  1. Sending your child to college. You worked hard you saved and now that investment in your childs future will pull you into the IRS dragnet.  2. Taking out a loan to buy equipment. Want to start a new business or invest in your current one? Thatll cost you your privacy.  3. Selling goods at a farmers market or Etsy shop. Do you create something or grow something and sell it directly to a consumer? If you did and deposited those dollars into a bank account youll be reported.  4. Saving for and making a large purchase. Want to buy a new car? Or do some home renovations? Or take your family on a trip? Your bank accounts will wind up in a dragnet.  5. Purchasing groceries for a family of four. With the cost of groceries skyrocketing under inflation  your account will be reported to the IRS even sooner.  Over the last several weeks Americans have voiced their outrage over this invasion of privacy including countless Middle and South Georgians. In response to the public outcry Congressional Democrats and the Biden Administration are trying to save face but proposed updates to the proposed rule would still pose a gross overreach into the private financial lives of Americans. I recently joined dozens of colleagues in sending a letter to President Biden on this issue.

February 1 2017 In a rollback of an Obama-era protection Donald Trumps White House withdrew the Mercury Effluent Rule which regulated the safe use and disposal of mercury in American dental offices. The Natural Resource Defense Council estimated the repeal would discharge five tons of the neurotoxic substance into water supplies each year. Even trace amounts of mercury can harm brain function and damage the human nervous system particularly in pregnant women and infants.  65.  February 1 2017  Trump and House Republicans rolled back an Obama-era regulation that required oil companies to provide purchasing information! when buying minerals from foreign governments. Concerned that oil companies would purchase oil from corrupt and violent foreign administrations the SEC had originally said Obamas regulation would combat government corruption through transparency and accountability. The repeal had long been on the oil lobbys wish list and will save oil industry giants about half a billion dollars per year in compliance costs.  66.  February 2 2017  Donald Trump vowed to dismantle the Johnson Amendment a law which restricted churches and other religious institutions from taking a public political stance while retaining tax-exempt status. When following through on his promised repeal proved legislatively difficult Trump signed an executive order encouraging leniency on enforcement of the amendment.  67.  February 3 2017  Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai rolled back an agreement with nine internet service providers that had encouraged ISPs to provide affordable internet access to low-income communities. This reversed the decision of Pais Obama-era predecessor Tom Wheeler and will remove a $9.25 per month credit for low-income households to purchase internet service.  68.  February 4 2017  Donald Trump posted a report to his Facebook page saying Kuwait would institute a travel ban on many Muslim-majority countries. The report was not truthful; Kuwait did no such thing. The Assistant Foreign Minister of Kuwait responded to Trumps false Facebook post: The State of Kuwait believes that granting of visa [sic] is a sovereign matter and is not linked to terrorism or violence or nationality or faith.  69.  February 4 2017  Donald Trump questioned the legitimacy of the federal judge who had blocked his travel ban calling Judge James Robart a so-called judge whose dissenting opinion had taken law-enforcement away from our country. Justice Robart had received a unanimous endorsement of well-qualified from the American Bar Association before his appointment to the bench by George W. Bush.  70.  February 7 2017  The Republican-led House Administration Committee voted to eliminate the Elections Assistance Commission which was the only federal agency charged with ensuring voting machines could not be hacked. Chairman of the committee Rep. Gregg Harper R-Mississippi stated the committee had outlived its usefulness to the nation. Only weeks prior to the EACs dissolution Donald Trump claimed hacks of voting machines allowed 3 million of people to vote illegally in the 2016 election. No evidence exists to support this claim.  71.  February 7 2017  In another rollback of Obama-era policies the House voted to eliminate two regulations on American education: the Teacher-Preparation Rule which ensured new teachers would enter classrooms fully qualified to teach; in addition to the School Accountability Act which evaluated the quality of service American schools provided to their students and distributed funds accordingly. Civil rights advocates have explained that the latter rule was vital to providing education budget for low-income schools and its removal could thereby harm funding for poorer areas of the country.  72.  February 7 2017  Donald Trump stated the murder rate in America had reached a 47-year peak. This was not true. While there had been a slight increase in murders from 2014 to 2015 the murder rate for both years was still more than 40 percent lower than it had been 47 years ago. In 1970 there were nearly 8 murders per 100000 people in America; in 2015 the latest year with full data collected by the FBI that number had fallen to 4.9 murders per 100000 people.  73.  February 7 2017  Donald Trump told a sheriff in Rockwell County Texas to destroy the career of a state senator who had opposed civil asset forfeiture. This controversial law enforcement practice allows police officers to seize cash and assets they believe may be related to a crime even if the property owners were never arrested or convicted of that crime.  74.  February 7 2017  Vice President Mike Pence cast a tie-breaking vote to confirm Donald Trumps appointment of Betsy DeVos as education secretary. At the time of her appointment to lead the Department of Education DeVos had no government experience and no experience working in public schools.  75.  February 8 2017  Despite extreme opposition the Senate confirmed Jeff Sessions as attorney general. Throughout his career as a lawyer and Alabama Senator Sessions had opposed assurances for the voting rights of minorities favored heavy criminal punishments for low-level drug offenders and routinely attacked civil rights.  76.  February 8 2017  President Trump used Twitter to lash out at Nordstrom for its decision to stop carrying his daughters retail brand. He tweeted about the company My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly.  77. February 9 2017  Donald Trump attacked Senator John McCain on Twitter. McCain had raised objections to the Yemen raid wherein one American soldier was killed and five others were wounded. Trump tweeted about McCain Only emboldens the enemy! Hes been losing so long he doesnt know how to win anymore. McCain was a prisoner of war in the Vietnam War enduring torture and solitary confinement after his plane was shot down in North Vietnam.  78.  February 9 2017  When meeting with senators Donald Trump addressed Democrats by saying that Pocahontas is now the face of your party. The racial epithet referenced Elizabeth Warren who has claimed Native American ancestry.  79.  February 9 2017  Three times in one week White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer referred to recent terrorist attacks in Atlanta which never actually happened. The City of Atlanta has not had a terrorist attack in 21 years in 1997 when Christian extremist Eric Robert Rudolph bombed Centennial Olympic Park. After misspeaking for the third time Sean Spicer acknowledged his mistake and explained that he meant to reference the nightclub attack in Orlando Florida in June 2016.  80.  February 9 2017  Senior White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted Ivanka Trumps retail brand while speaking on television in her official capacity as an aide to President Trump. Go buy Ivankas stuff is what I would tell you Conway said on Fox and Friends Im going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today everybody. Sales for Ivankas brand skyrocketed that day almost tripling after Conways appearance. Jason Chaffetz the Republican Chairman of the House Oversight Committee joined ranking Democrats in jointly issuing a letter to the Office of Government Ethics calling for a review of Conways comments. In response to inquiries on disciplinary action for Conway Press Secretary Sean Spicers stated she had been counseled on her behavior.  81.  February 9  2017  Before a day of golf with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe Donald Trump tweeted that refugees were flooding in from the seven suspect countries his travel ban had outlawed and that these refugees were SO DANGEROUS. In January Fox News reported that no terrorist attacks had been perpetrated by refugees from countries on Trumps list.  82.  February 9 2017  Donald Trump knew about Michael Flynns contact with a Russian ambassador for weeks before Flynns resignation as a national security adviser. Reportedly the Justice Department warned Trump about their concerns with Flynn on January 26 2017; Michael Flynns forced resignation did not arrive until February 13 more than three weeks later.  83.  February 11 2017  Donald Trump claimed without evidence that 3 million illegal votes went to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. Politifact and Snopes have both debunked the claimwith Snopes saying the 3 million non-citizens may just as well have been plucked out of thin air. The number appeared to originate from an InfoWars article which sought to explain why Donald Trump lost the popular vote by 2.9 million votes.  84.  February 12 2017  In a televised interview with George Stephanopoulos senior White House policy adviser Stephen Miller reaffirmed Donald Trumps unsubstantiated suspicion of voter fraud in the presidential election. When challenged for evidence by Stephanopoulos Miller replied This morning on this show is not the venue for me to lay out all the evidence. But I can tell you this voter fraud is a serious problem in this country. Miller never subsequently offered any evidence for his claim.  85.  February 12 2017  In a tweet from their official account the Department of Education misspelled the name of W.E.B. Du Bois. In a follow-up tweet apologizing for the error the Department of Education misspelled the word apologies.  86. - February 12 2017  In the wake of Donald Trumps travel ban some international travelers faced increased scrutiny at airports and in some cases were asked to deliver digital information to Border Protection. Sidd Bikkannavar a natural-born U.S. citizen and scientist at NASA was detained at an airport in Texas upon his return from Chile and pressured into unlocking his cell phone for search. Haisam Elsharkawi an American citizen and electronics salesman from Anaheim California surrendered his cell phone after persistent pressure from border control. He said in an interview that border control told him they would confiscate the phone if he did not comply. Elsharkawi said I opened the doors of hell when I asked for a lawyer. They just started attacking me verbally. Why do you need a lawyer? Are you a criminal? What are you hiding?  87.  February 12 2017  After receiving news that North Korea had fired a ballistic missile (the first during Donald Trumps presidency) Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe strategized during dinner in the main dining room at Trumps Mar-a-Lago resort in full view of other diners.  88.  February 13 2017  Less than one month after Trump took office Michael Flynn resigned as national security adviser. His resignation followed the public revelation that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about his contact with Russians. Contrary to what Michael Flynn had told Pence Flynn had discussed Russian sanctions in a December meeting with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.  89.  February 14 2017  Kellyanne Conway told the press that Michael Flynns resignation had been voluntary. Just hours later Sean Spicer said Whether or not he actually misled the vice president was the issue and that was ultimately what led to the president asking for and accepting the resignation of General Flynn.  90.  February 14 2017  The day after Michael Flynn resigned FBI Director James Comey reported Donald Trump requested a private meeting] [BP2] to talk about Mike Flynn. Trump told Comey that Flynn had misled Mike Pence about his conversations with Russian representatives but that Flynn was a good guy. Trump said he hoped Comey could let this go.  91.  February 14 2017  In the wake of Michael Flynns resignation for lying to senior officials and interacting with Russian representatives after the election Donald Trump tweeted The real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington? Will these leaks be happening as I deal with N.Korea etc?  92.  February 14 2017  The House Ways and Means Committee rejected a Democratic proposal requesting Donald Trump release his tax returns Under federal tax law the chairman of the committee can request tax information from the treasury. Chairman of the committee Republican Kevin Brady declined to exercise that power in Trumps case citing invasion of taxpayers privacy rights.  93.  February 15 2017  Vice President Mike Pence falsely stated that no member of the Trump campaign including national security adviser Michael Flynn had contact with Russian officials. Pence publicly defended Flynns phone calls to Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak claiming Flynn did not discuss sanctions against Russia (Flynn later confessed to the FBI that he had). Pence did not realize that Flynn had misled him until two weeks after he made his public assertion well after Donald Trump had become aware of Flynns Russian contacts.  94.  February 16 2017  Donald Trump asked April Ryan an African American reporter and White House correspondent if she would arrange a meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus. After Ryan asked a question about Trump meeting with the Caucus he said Do you want to set up the meeting? Are they friends of yours?  95.  February 16 2017  Staff at the United States Department of Agriculture were given a list of blacklisted terms which the agency would no longer use in their scientific research. The memo instructed scientists to replace climate change with weather extremes and reduce greenhouse gases with build soil organic matter increase nutrient use efficiency. Explaining the decision in an email the Deputy Chief of Programs wrote It has become clear one of the previous administrations priority is not consistent with that of the incoming administration. Namely that priority is climate change. Please visit with your staff and make them aware of this shift in perspective within the executive branch.  96.  February 16 2017  Using the Congressional Review Act Donald Trump repealed the so-called stream protection rule which kept coal companies from dumping mining debris into rivers. Barack Obama first implemented the regulation after a growing body of evidence suggested the debris could contain toxic materials such as selenium mercury and arsenic. Trumps repeal has been on the wish list for the coal industry since the rules publication in December of 2016.  97.  February 16 2017  In the first two months of 2017 Republican lawmakers scheduled only 88 town hall meetings with their constituents. In 2015 by comparison Republicans held 222 town halls during the same two-month period.  98.  February 17 2017  In what has become a regular attack on free press Donald Trump tweeted The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes @NBCNews @ABC @CBS @CNN) is not my enemy it is the enemy of the American People!  99.  February 18 2017  The Department of Homeland Security drafted a proposal to mobilize the National Guard in an effort to arrest undocumented immigrants. While the DHS never implemented the proposal and the White House denied it had existed in the first place (despite the 11-page memo leaking to the Associated Press) Washington lawmakers saw the draft as an indication that the Trump administration was willing to consider military force as a means of rounding up undocumented immigrants.  100.  February 19 2017  The Trump administration asked the Council of Economic Advisers to predict a 3.5% surge in economic production over the next decade. Compared to the 1.8% projected by the Federal Reserve this calculation could be dangerously optimistic. The risk explained the president of the Committee Responsible for Federal Budget is that rosy economic scenarios allow us to borrow trillions of additional dollars in the next couple of years doing real damage.  101.  February 20 2017  Donald Trump signed an executive order that instructed the Bureau of Land Management to lift a moratorium on new coal mining leases for federal land. A full 40 percent of the coal mined in America comes from federal property. In one such state-owned region the Powder River Basin of Wyoming and Montana private companies produced coal that accounts for 10 percent of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. The Obama administration introduced the original moratorium on new mining leases to curb the environmental consequences of coal. Without renewal the current leases would have allowed mining to continue as is for another 20 years; now with Trumps decision to permit renewed leases that timeframe may extend much further into the future.  102.  February 22 2017  The Trump International Hotel in Washington D.C. received an estimated $40000-$60000 for hosting an event held by the Embassy of Kuwait. This violates the foreign emoluments clause of the Constitution which forbids government officials from accepting any present Emolument Office or Title of any kind whatever from any King Prince or foreign State. Trump never divested from his companies and thus has continued to benefit from payments to the Trump Organization.  103.  Feburary 22 2017  Donald Trump signed an executive order halting an Obama-era directive that allowed transgender students to use the school bathroom corresponding to their gender identity. Civil rights groups said the executive order would reinforce a culture of discrimination and could further endanger transgender students.  104.  February 23 2017  Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the Justice Department would renew its contracts with for-profit prisons. This reversed an Obama-era decision to phase out federal use of private correctional facilities. In decades past privately-run facilities were used to address the U.S.s overflowing public prisons which saw the number of incarcerated people skyrocket 800 percent between 1980 and 2013. After Barack Obama introduced a series of significant prison reforms in 2013 (most significantly a directive to lower sentences for non-violent offenders) the Justice Department anticipated less demand for corporate-run prisons as the number of prisoners was expected to dwindle significantly. Because the Trump administration announced a new crackdown on crime Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the Justice Department would need to renew contracts with the private institutions in order to meet the future needs of the federal correctional system.  105.  February 24 2017  After Donald Trumps speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference where he declared certain media outlets to be FAKE NEWS White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer temporarily barred the New York Times CNN and Politico from the daily White House press briefing. While reporters from these publications were not permitted into the briefing the Trump administration allowed entrance for correspondents from Fox News and Breitbart News.  106.  February 24 2017  After Donald Trumps election Republican lawmakers in 18 states proposed new legislation intended to curb mass protests. Among these were increased consequences for protests blocking roadways new punishments for any demonstrators wearing a mask and in Arizona a law which would allow the state to seize the assets of any person attending a protest which later turned violent.  107.  February 25 2017  Donald Trump announced he would not attend the White House Correspondents Dinner. Without further explanation Trump tweeted I will not be attending the White House Correspondents Association Dinner this year. Please wish everyone well and have a great evening! The last president to skip the dinner was Ronald Reagan in 1981 who at the time had been recovering from an assassination attempt.  108.  February 26 2017  The Trump Organization claimed it had made good on its promise to donate all profits earned from foreign governments to the U.S. Treasury. However it provided no evidence of how much it donated or how that amount was calculated. Since his company has accepted payments from foreign governments (see numbers 41 42 63 102 135 210 277 319) Donald Trump may have violated the Constitutions Emoluments Clause which prohibits any U.S. official from receiving gifts or compensation from another nations government. By all recent evidence Trump has neither divested from his companies nor set up a blind trust for his assets.  109.  February 27 2017  In his first budget proposal Donald Trump boosted defense and security spending by $54 billion. He proposed slashing the budget for non-defense spending in areas like education science poverty programs and environmental protection by almost the same amount.  110.  February 27 2017  The Justice Department dropped its long-standing claim that a Texas voter I.D. law discriminated against black and Latino voters. The announcement ended a 6-year period of opposition against the I.D. law indicating the DoJs new priorities under Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the Trump administration. Sessions has a history of favoring controversial views surrounding voter identity once going so far as to say the Voting Rights Actthe landmark piece of federal legislation which protected equal voting rights for minority Americanswas an intrusive act. The new Texas voter I.D. law has long garnered criticism for imposing hurdles which disproportionately affect minority voters. In August of 2017 a federal judge granted a permanent injunction against the I.D. law ruling that lawmakers had created it with discriminatory intent.  111.  February 28 2017  To stop a long string of press leaks Donald Trump approved a rule allowing White House senior staff to examine the cell phones of anyone working in the White House. According to Politico senior staffers invited aides to an emergency meeting wherein the junior staffers had to relinquish all mobile devices for search. Press Secretary Sean Spicer led the charge on the operation informing junior staffers that apps such as Signal and Confideencrypted messaging appswould violate the Presidential Records Act. Spicer warned staffers against speaking to the press about the emergency meetings; the story was almost immediately leaked to the press.

BRIANNA WU ANNOUNCES SUPPORT FOR SEN. ELIZABETH WARRENS PLAN TO REGULATE BIG TECH  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE March 8 2019 Press Representative: Paul Casali (917) 714-4205 paul@briannawu2020.com  DEDHAM Massachusetts - Candidate for U.S. Congress Brianna Wu announced strong support for the plan proposed by Senator Elizabeth Warren to regulate large tech companies. Wu is running for the 8th Congressional District in Massachusetts and is widely recognized as a national political leader on technology issues.  This is a smart ambitious plan said Ms. Wu. And it will create competition in the tech industry. Our field is best when we are forced to innovate.  Warrens plan includes a proposal to force Facebook to sell Instagram and Whats App - a move reminiscent of the anti-trust action against Microsoft in the late 1990s. Wu says this is the most important part of Senator Warrens plan.  Facebook buys all competition in sight said Wu. And even though most consumers are disgusted with the way they behave they have no place to turn. The is anti-competitive and ultimately stifles competition. Wu added that Oculus a leading virtual reality technology should be added to the list.  The proposed legislation also places limits on the ability of large tech companies to collect private information about users and sell it. Right now the financial incentives are to gather every piece of information they can said Wu. Its the reason most Americans no longer have privacy. This plan will put consumers back in control of their digital lives.  Wu wants to expand Warrens Proposal and create liability for companies that are grossly negligent in how they treat cybersecurity. Big tech wont take cybersecurity seriously until its more expensive to do it wrong than to do it right. Under my plan companies will be indemnified against legal action for breaches if they follow Infosec best practices. But if they dont as was the case with Equifax they should expect to answer to their users in court.  Wu added that Warrens plan is a great start. I dont agree with everything in this plan but it is a strong first step. When I am serving in the United States Congress this bill will have strong support in my office.  For interview requests or follow-up comments please contact the Press Representative listed above.  ###,political,Facebook

"Truly an Honor  It was truly an honor and a privilege to have been involved in my latest investigation. And I thank God for allowing me to bring it to a successful conclusion.  I won't get into specifics because the family has asked for privacy and rightly so as they will need time to nourish this new relationship.  Last year I was contacted by Houston radio personality Chris X Blayney who asked if he could refer a woman to me who needed help. As it turns out after a bitter divorce and child custody case her 1-year-old daughter had been abducted by her ex-husband. They both had disappeared and had not been seen since.  Here's the catch. That was 26 years ago.  The mother contacted me and I listened to her explain the situation. For the past 26 years the FBI the State Department the US Consulate Interpol the Harris County DAs office local law enforcement United States Senators and Representatives other State and Federal organizations several Private Investigators and a plethora of Mexican Government agencies had all worked on this investigation to find the ex-husband and the missing girl.  And for the past 26 years no one was able to find them.  For me the case was intriguing for a number of reasons. My first thought was this:  ""This girl is a Texan. It's time to saddle up and go get her.""  But I know the emotions involved in a case like this and that is not something I take lightly. After speaking with the mother I agreed to ""look"" into the case. And with multiple warnings of ""Don't get your hopes up"" I gave her the only promise I am willing to offer any time I take on an investigation.  ""I can make no promise but this. I promise to do my best.""  And this was my challenge:  -Travel to a foreign country to a city where I had never been. -Where they speak a language I don't understand. -To find a girl I've never seen before. In fact a girl no one has seen for the past 26 years since she was 1-year-old.  And so...by the grace of God...  I found her.  Over the past five months I have traveled to Mexico several times to develop information that came in through a website the mother had set up for tips as to her daughter's whereabouts.  While developing this information...I was able to successfully locate both the long-missing daughter now 27 years old and the ex-husband who were still living together under alias names.  And on Tuesday August 17 2021 I traveled back to Mexico along with the mother and a family friend who has been instrumental in assisting in this investigation for years.  With the threat of Hurricane Grace bearing down on us we met with Mexican officials and developed a plan of action. Then I and the local Mexican Police Chief with a team of his tactical officers went to the house where I found them and successfully made contact with both the ex-husband...AND the missing girl.  We took them back to the local police station where...for the first time in 26 years...  The mother and daughter were reunited.  They are working slowly to develop the mother-daughter relationship they've never had. The relationship that was stolen from them a lifetime ago.  And so I respect their privacy and won't go into further details. I thank God for the honor of having been able to help this mother end her agonizing lifetime search for her abducted daughter and for being able to arrange their reunion. Twenty-six years is a long time and I can't even pretend to know the pain she's had to endure.  Please join me in praying for this mother and daughter as they form a new relationship during the most difficult of situations. It will be a long process with language barriers involved that will make it even more difficult. They need our prayers and support.  May God bless them and allow their new relationship to blossom. And may joy and happiness fill both their lives tenfold as compared to the suffering they have both had to endure for the past 26 years.  ",political,Facebook
Our town relies on numerous volunteers for elected and unelected boards and commissions and to run youth sports and other organizations. We applaud all volunteers and teachers in our town whose work too often goes unrecognized. Few of them have political ambition and no parent expects private correspondence with the school district to be broadcast and politicized.  Today four days before Election Day Good Morning Wilton decided to publish a series of emails between our Board of Ed candidates and the school and town. These were not political. They were emails by parents concerned about issues affecting their kids.  Whatever anyone thinks of that fact GMW went even further violating the legitimate privacy interests of children of these candidates by publishing one or more of their names as well as emails making plain which children on an individual basis were being discussed. One or more private emails of at least one Wilton teacher was likewise published.  Publishing these was a grotesque misjudgment and our candidates -- all candidates volunteers and teachers in our town -- deserve an apology from GMW. While we appreciate that GMW removed the subject posts and our candidates wish to move forward there is no room for disagreement that GMW should apologize for this very disappointing and grievous error in judgment.  No parent wants to see their private correspondence over school concerns broadcast like this and GMW should have known better.  For their part our candidates will continue to focus on what's most important: You the voters and your input on how our town can move forward.,political,Facebook

Did you know that roll call votes in which each Senators vote is individually recorded are not mandatory? In fact theyre not even the norm in the Massachusetts State Senate. Of more than 3000 legislative matters that have come before them the current Senate has only taken roll call votes on 260.  Without a record of how our elected officials vote how can we know if they are actually representing our best interests? Take my opponent for example. He touts a 100% voting record but never mentions that sometimes he merely votes present rather than yea or nay on legislation that directly impacts lived realities in our district.  If elected I will do everything I can to ensure that all votes and voting records are public and easily accessible because you deserve to know what your elected officials are doing in your name. The norm should be legislative transparency and Ill work to get it done.  Ill work to make state government transparent and accountable in other ways too. I served as the first ever eDiscovery Attorney for the Massachusetts Executive Office of Health and Human Services work for which I received a Citation for Outstanding Performance from Governor Charlie Baker so I understand the importance of information management and data security. Thats why Ill be an effective advocate for improved government information management privacy and security.  Finally I will support culturally competent census awareness and implementation. Accurately documenting the demographics of our state is a critical part of ensuring adequate funding for our schools highways and other government-funded services. I will work to make sure that every resident is accounted for and that the data collected on them cannot be used for purposes of discrimination.  As your next Senator I will not forget who I work for and you will always know where I stand. I respectfully ask for your vote on Tuesday November 6. Thank you.

"This article was written by Ron Paul Campaign for Liberty For over two years weve watched the national media elites cheerlead for the Russian Collusion charade as the Deep State targeted a politician they HATE -- just for the crime of beating their chosen candidate in 2016.  Now theyre going for President Trumps jugular with an impeachment scheme that looks fully-backed by the Deep State.  Ive been shouting from the rooftops for decades that our fragile Republic wont last long if we continually hand the government spying powers over our lives.  After all if theyll go after a sitting president you or any other law-abiding American could be next.  The good news is with a major battle looming over reauthorization of the so-called ""USA Freedom Act"" and some of the Deep States most intrusive surveillance powers you and I could have our best opportunity to strike a deathblow against Big Brother and restore the Fourth Amendment protections all law-abiding Americans deserve.  Today our Constitutions Fourth Amendment -- which protects American citizens right to privacy against government snoops -- is hanging by a thread.  The fact is the Deep State is hell-bent on collecting your (and every other Americans) emails phone records text messages Internet searches instant messages online purchases and Facebook posts -- the reach of the Big Government statists surveillance powers over you and me should scare every liberty-loving American to the core.  And once the experts in Washington D.C. know how we live its only a matter of time until they start trying to fix us by telling us what we can and cant own read watch think listen to and teach our kids and grandkids.  Of course they tell you and me trust us and everything will be ok.  But how can we knowing our government has targeted political opponents like Martin Luther King Jr. routinely in the past?  How can we after the IRS -- under the last president -- was caught red-handed targeting limited government organizations?  How can we after the last administration illegally wiretapped reporters who dared criticize them?  I dont know about you but I sure dont trust safeguards and oversight the Deep State promises you and me to protect our privacy.  Court documents revealed earlier this year that the NSA illegally collected millions upon millions of phone call and message records on innocent Americans. As one Bloomberg News report stated the NSA ""deliberately ignored restrictions on their authority to spy on Americans multiple times in the past decade.""  And just since the lid was blown off our federal governments domestic surveillance programs in the summer of 2013 weve seen story after story hit the press regarding NSA abuses including: >>> NSA employees spying on ex-lovers and spouses -- a practice so common the intelligence community has come up with their own jargon LOVEINT to describe it;  >>> REFUSING to say whether or not they spied on members of Congress which would effectively destroy any ability of our governments Legislative Branch to police this rogue agency;  >>> Effectively GUTTING attorney-client privilege by holding confidential records.  There are literally thousands of examples of abuse. The FBI has become so emboldened theyre using DMV photos to launch a massive facial recognition database!  And now Deep State operatives in the Trump administration are pushing Congress for a permanent reauthorization of the USA Freedom Act -- the phony reform bill Congress passed to replace Section 216 of the ""PATRIOT"" Act -- which was supposed to ""fix"" the NSA's unconstitutional domestic spying procedures.  You and I cant let the Deep State get away with their plot to cement its dragnet surveillance powers over law-abiding Americans.  SO PLEASE ACT NOW  With the ""USA Freedom Act"" set to expire at the end of this year this could be our best opportunity to strike a deathblow against Big Brother and restore the Fourth Amendment protections all law-abiding Americans deserve. Please contact David Rouzer or Greg Murphy at 202-224-3121 and ask them to let the USA Freedom Act expire. DO NOT VOTE FOR A PERMANENT REAUTHORIZATION.",political,Facebook
The Good the Bad and the Ugly updates Regarding Highways 10 41 and 65 from MoDot. Please share.  Northwest District For more information contact Customer Service at 888 ASK MODOT (1-888-275-6636)  July 17 2019  Route 10 now open west of Norborne Other routes remain closed  NORBORNE Mo.  As one east/west route opens two north/south routes look to remain closed for an extended period. Missouri Route 10 west of Norborne reopened to traffic today after water receded and crews from the Missouri Department of Transportation completed minor repairs and debris removal.  Receding water doesnt always mean a roadway can reopen though. Travelers who rely on Route 41 to Miami have been anxiously awaiting the water to go down and their route reopened. However floodwater undermined the roadway and while the water is off the road it will need to be repaired by a contractor before it is safe for motorists. Currently the timeframe for reopening Route 41 is not known.  U.S. Route 65 south of Carrollton remains closed with water over the roadway. Floodwater remains so high that damage to the road surface and the road bed are not yet exposed and no assessments can be made. Crews continue to monitor water levels and are making repairs and clearing debris as they are able but many parts of U.S. Route 65 are still inaccessible due to high water.  While these prolonged closures are a burden on many for your own safety and the safety of those who may follow you do not move barricades. Barricades are in place for your protection. As soon as the roadway is safe for motorists we will remove all barricades.  If you come upon a flooded roadway without barricades do NOT drive through the water. Pull over to a safe location and call the MoDOTs 24-hour Customer Service line at 888 ASK MODOT (1-888-275-6636) to report it.

ARE YOU AT RISK? Several of Spring Hopes private residents text messages ended up in the hands of a local newspaper this past week. Many of you will be surprised when you wake up one day this week and potentially read the newspaper only to find that text messages you sent a town commisioner with a reasonable expectation of privacy were published without your consent. I personally have faith that the ethic and moral compass of the Spring Hope Enterprise will protect these messages sent by private citizens. The Spring Hope Enterprise has always been the most professional and fair newspaper Spring Hope has ever had.  All the details about how this happened are in this post.  After you finish reading my post please comment below so we can have an open community conversation together because many of you are at risk and this may be the only way to stop it. Now is not the time to send yet another text to your favorite commisioner asking them if your text were some that got released. It would make it even worse if it were just a few citizens that were singled out and released. If you rather skip reading the rest of my post and still try to protect yourself and all fellow private citizens of Spring Hope simply copy and paste this in the comments below: Town officials please always make sure to separate out private citizens messages before fulfilling a public records request. We all make mistakes but please be more careful next time. Spring Hope Enterprise please dont publish any messages sent by private citizens even if to a town official without written consent. Only text messages sent by town officials should be published as part of your public records request.  I firmly believe that if all of the newspapers readers and subscribers ask them to keep all private citizens messages out of their paper they will respect your wishes.  A public record request is used to get communications and records of our elected officials and those with the authority to govern. This is a very important part of our democracy as is freedom of the press. However a private citizen should not have to worry about their messages being released to the press because they in no way have the ability to govern the public and are not public officials. A resident of Spring Hope should not have to worry if their messages will be published without consent as part of the freedoms of the press.  In the the next few months most of you will get to know me really well Ill become your neighbor. Youll have my personal cell phone number and email. Many of you will call text or email me regularly. Some of you already do.  If I become your mayor I hope that you will still see me as your neighbor and continue to stay in regular contact with me.  As your mayor listening to you will be one of the most important parts of my job. You should be able to tell me anything in confidence that it will stay between us unless you wish for me to make it public. The media will have a right to request my communications just as they did last week of our current board. However as a private citizen you will never have to worry about what you send me ending up in the local newspaper. I will always take the time to separate my messages out from yours so that all private citizens messages are kept strictly confidential. As a private citizen even if you tell me to fire all the police officers and lower your taxes it should still be separated out and remain confidential because private citizens do not have the authority to govern. Even if a pay raise for the police and a .04% tax increase was discussed at the board meeting the night before your messages sent as a private citizen are not part of official town business because youre a private citizen without the authority to govern. Therefore your messages should not be released to the media as part of a public records request. I will not violate your trust. We are all as private citizens now sadly at risk of having our messages published because of careless mistakes made.  Right now the power to do the right thing to show all private citizens their messages are now safe is in the hands of newspaper. Allowing just one message from a private citizen make it to the news article regardless of which private citizen sent the message regardless of what the content of the message was would be a very scary day for us all.  Im asking all of you to please openly talk below. If youd rather just copy and paste a reply use this: Town officials please always make sure to separate out private citizens messages before fulfilling a public records request. We all make mistakes but please be more careful next time. Spring Hope Enterprise please dont publish any messages sent by private citizens even if to a town official without written consent. Only text messages sent by town officials should be published as part of your public records request.  Thanks Kyle,political,Facebook

A CAUTIONARY TALE  There are places where birth control is forbidden by law not religion. In places where the state controls everything it can determine What the individual needs and how much they need.  Communism is such a state. At first they take from the richest their wealth and their livelihood and people do not object. After all had they not chafed and envied? But when that is done the state moves on down the line they take what the middle class has owned homes family businesses and farms their dignity. Eventually there is no private anything. The people are told when and how to vote when to march and when to clap and yes when to procreate.  Of course by this time they have no privacy and no access to birth control except abstinence. Their income is low their housing inadequate and shared even with strangers. But the state needs strong men to man the factories and plows to join the army to enforce the states will. It also needs women with strong wombs to grow more of the same.  To save one woman living with this dilemma I became a smuggler. Before leaving to visit family in Budapest I visited my OBGYN and explained the need for an IUD to go he understood and prescribed one for me. Disguised in my carry on bag it traveled safely to Budapest. The process repeated as replacements were needed. It was never found though my bags were searched for contraband every time.  Other things were matter of course all of us who went to visit took stockings and clothing money and food even an occasional periodical. Except for the periodical everyday things were allowed. What they could not search were our thoughts. The information we took in and brought out. Perhaps they did not care they knew that nobody would believe what we told and they were right nobody did. If Americans had listened we would not now be heading down the road to Communisim.  After all they provide free education free medical care If one was deemed worthy.  Once on the slippery slope to free where does it stop? Who pays for it?  The moral of the story: Any government any at all is only as good as the people in it and power corrupts absolute power corrupts absolutely.,political,Facebook
Im curious to know your thoughts The phrase contact tracing has received a lot of attention recently. If someone tests positive for COVID-19 contact tracing is the process of identifying other people who have been near that patient recently and notifying those other individuals they may have been exposed.  Many experts believe contact tracing will play a significant role in our efforts to keep infection rates low. Let's dig into three related topics: 1 tracing apps 2 human contact tracers and 3 a very important question: Then what?  First on tracing apps for cell phones: Apple and Google are rolling out updates to their mobile operating systems (iOS and Android) that should help the development of COVID-19 contact tracing apps. From a privacy standpoint Im very pleased to see both companies (A) require user consent before these apps will work on someones phone (B) only allow tracing apps to collect the minimum amount of data necessary and (C) prohibit these apps from knowing where they are. Bluetooth technology will enable participating phones to know about their proximity to one another  in case notification is needed down the road  but the apps themselves wont know where that encounter took place.  However we should not get a false sense of security once these apps have been developed. For starters false positives will be likely. You could be sitting three feet away from someone with COVID-19 but the app has no way of knowing youre in a completely different office separated by a wall. There will also be false negatives where youve possibly been exposed but the app either cant notify you because the infected person isnt using that technology or wont notify you because something about the encounter doesnt meet the programmed criteria (e.g. duration too short outdoor location etc.)  The point is apps may be one tool in the shed but theyll need to be supplemented with human expertise. Thats where contact tracers come in. These are professionals who perform detective-like work to figure out who an infected person has been around and then make efforts to contact those individuals. Clearly this approach also has limitations.  The longer this pandemic lasts however the more important itll be to have some combination of safe audited privacy-sensitive technology coupled with the expertise of human contact tracers. So that leads us to the third topic: Then what?   What should happen when contact tracing identifies someone who has possibly been exposed to COVID-19?  Should you go to work if you cannot work remotely?  Do you have a responsibility to self-isolate?  Should you be required to be tested?  Should government be able to restrict the movement of someone who has a verified likely exposure to COVID-19? If so under what circumstances?  I have some strong opinions on these questions but want to hear what you think in the comments below. (Keep it clean please. I cant respond to every comment of course but look forward to reading what everyone thinks.),political,Facebook
Last night while we rightfully celebrated the elevation of so many new progressive women to leadership positions in the House and state Governor offices many of us were also watching returns in places like West Virginia Alabama and our home state of Ohio with disgust. Two states passed sweeping anti-abortion measures and Ohio has elected as governor the most ardent opponent to bodily autonomy the state has seen in decades.  We know how devastating it can be to put blood sweat and tears into an election only to come out short. You did everything right; you marched you protested you knocked doors you stood at polls you made calls you donated and you voted all in defense of a constitutional right to be secure in your own body - and this morning it doesn't feel like it was enough.  In many ways being an abortion rights activist in Ohio means death by 1000 cuts - progress can be scant and regression happens piecemeal from all sides at every turn. Anti-abortion groups flood the legislative schedule and judicial docket with unconstitutional laws that have already been litigated over and over they abuse patients at clinics and they blatantly engage in voter intimidation in hopes that they will overwhelm our ability to resist. Their greatest hope is that we will succumb to the exhaustion of always being on the defensive.  Don't give into despair.  In the end we know that we are the majority of Americans that we are defending a fundamental right of privacy and bodily autonomy and that every time a woman makes a decision about what is best for her and her family - free from outside interference or influence - the world becomes just a bit better of a place.  We'll keep fighting and we'll keep doing it in community - loudly and joyously. A week from today is our next show benefiting . We'll hope you'll join us as there IS much to celebrate but there is also work to be done. The fight for 2020 and 2022 started when the polls closed yesterday and we aim to make it clear to the DeWine administration that from the first day of his term to the last: We Will Fight.  With gratitude for all that you have done -Pat and Amber,political,Facebook
The plan for a pandemic we should have had and should be working on now. We can still make this happen.  Some have asked me what my plan was/is for dealing with our current health crisis. And that is a fair point. I actually agree with the plan as developed from the American Enterprise Institute.  Here it is in outline form.   Create a system that can suppress coronavirus outbreaks without widespread lockdowns. That will require extensive testing: estimates say 750000 per WEEK. And that number is now possible and might even be better using rapid tests like the one Abbott Labs released to reduce turnaround times. If people test positive they must immediately isolate themselves.   Testing and isolation is NOT enough to halt virus or curb any upticks because people are contagious long before symptoms present. To deal with that public health authorities need to use contact tracing. (like what was used for HIV/AIDS) but this virus moves SO fast traditional tedious hand counting and tracing methods will not work. Again here we can use technology to our advantage. Singapore used a contact-tracing app relying on the Bluetooth signals from peoples phones to determine who may have been in close proximity to someone who tested positive. (yes we need to deal with privacy concerns around thatbecause yes it does scream of big brother or big government tracking). However there may be alternative solutions for that as well while preserving anonymity. And Apple and Google may ALREADY have that data. Using that same app we can quickly notify people that they have been exposed and that they need to be tested immediately and if positive self-quarantine to prevent further spreading. o This can start at the local and state levels and we need both funding and policy changes to make that work. Federal money should provide the funding and local government public health agencies must loosen their rules on who should be tested. (and this is why we need more science trained and critical thinking people in government) o Secondly we need a NATIONAL syndromic surveillance system to tie local and state information together from the contact-tracing throughout the country to identify possible outbreak hot spots   After test-and-trace systems are in place and new cases have fallen for 14 or more days lift shutdowns BUT NOT ALL AT ONCE! o Using a phased approach to reopening businesses with telework distance learning and personal social distancing continuing as much as possible o Maintaining bans on gatherings of more than 50 people o ONLY once a vaccine is in place (probably mid-2021) can all restrictions be lifted.   If an outbreak begins to spike again then another shutdown should be implemented.,political,Facebook
SB 8 which destroys community-based policing in New Mexico just passed and will now go to the Governors desk. I want to make sure everyone understands this dangerous bill.  This bill requires body cams for police officers. No one objects to this. Many if not most good officers already want to use them voluntarily for their own protection. But the language of this bill forever changes the way that police officers will be viewed by both the communities and the authorities they serve.  SB 8 declares police officers GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT even if there's an honest technological problem with the camera. Every day police officers will have to prove their own innocence over and over again. Placed in that position of constant suspicion and presumption of guilt before innocence why would a good cop stay in a state with those policies in place?  But its not only that. Police must record every conversation even if a neighbor acting in good faith wants to remain confidential to protect themselves. This escalates the increasing divide between citizens and police. Police now placed in a permanent position of suspicion will be forced to behave less like members of their communities and more like mercenaries set apart who only enforce the will of the states authority.  Now you might say well why would a cop ever have a good reason for not using a body cam or recording device?  Imagine a single mom in a rough neighborhood trying to protect her kids by working with police. Or a business owner in a similar situation. Both of these folks may now be punished or intimidated by gangs for working with police. And theyre far less likely to help law enforcement if they know that there will be official documentation of that interaction for all eyes to see. Why would anyone in a tough neighborhood cooperate with a police officer ever again? This bill destroys the trust and privacy of the brave people who want to make their communities safer. This is the end of community policing as we know it and it effectively surrenders high-crime areas to the gangs and cartels who have moved in abandoning the good people who are left in those neighborhoods.,political,Facebook

A new letter to the president about his sad Supreme Court pick ...  Dear Mr. Trump  A judge who doesnt make law but only interprets the law? Complete nonsense!  You know that you dont have to ask Kavanagh if hes going to reverse Roe v. Wade. He will do so ASAP. The kind of judge that the Federalist Society approves of has made up his mind on that point already because  purportedly  the Constitution does not expressly say that theres a right of privacy in the individual vis--vis the government.  Kavanaghs interpretation will in effect make it the law that the government has the right to control womens bodies to force those bodies to bear children whether or not the woman who has conceived wants a child or can take care of a child to force those bodies to bear children whether or not the embryo was conceived as a result of rape or incest whether or not the embryo is viable whether or not continuing to term will not only threaten the health of but potentially kill the mother. That is making law and  wink wink -- you know thats exactly what Kavanagh will do  And what next? Where in the Constitution does it say explicitly that inhabitants of the United States cannot be beaten up by police officers for their political beliefs for their ethnicity for their refugee status for their sexual orientation? Where in the Constitution does it say explicitly that people have a right to use contraception or marry whom they wish? Where in the Constitution does it say explicitly that parents have a right to decide what schools their children can attend? In fact where in the Constitution does it say that parents have any rights in the upbringing of their children?  Kavanagh will make law when it damn well pleases him and the so-called conservatives Sir. They will be activist judges whenever they feel it suits your agenda.  Unless the Senate refuses to confirm him. It will take the defection of only two Republican senators and the courageous action of all the Democratic senators to stop this charade of interpreting but not making the law.

"Everyone here is an email you can send to Attorney General Jeff Landry as well as your legislators asking for them to advocate for our industry in the Phase 1 opening in Louisiana. You can get their contact info here. https://www.ag.state.la.us/ http://www.legis.la.gov/legis/FindMyLegislators.aspx Please email them. If they get enough response from us perhaps they will consider us in the reopening of the state. You can copy and paste and tweak to your liking.  Dear Mr.  Thank you for taking the time to read this despite your busy schedule. It is encouraging to see that you are advocating to get so many small businesses reopened. It is desperately needed and I know you have a tough job ahead of you. Your work to get the economy moving again is appreciated by many. With the movement towards Phase I of opening our state I would like to ask that consideration be given to reopening Massage Therapists alongside hairdressers and nail salons. I can greatly understand the fear in doing so as we are all working to control the spread of COVID 19. The environments that we work in however are at a minimal just as secure as as those of hair salons barbershops and nail salons. In fact oftentimes our work environment is even more so. Hairdressers who must still have physical contact with their clients to perform services must be a certain distance apart. Massage therapists already practice what we have come to call ""social distancing"" on a daily basis. In establishments where there is more than one therapist we typically work in separate rooms with one client. In fact many therapists are independent contractors that work alone. This solves the problem of keeping a safe distance from other people while we work. So the first step taken towards safety is actually how we normally do business on a daily basis. We can implement the use of masks according to guidelines just as well as every other establishment already doing so without hindrance to our job duties therefore not compromising our clients' safety. Most of us work by appointment only which means that we can control how many people are sitting in our lobby through scheduling. This again is usual protocol anyway for many independent therapists in order to protect our clients' privacy. The time between scheduled clients is already spent washing hands changing sheets (which are already used to avoid direct contact with therapeutic tables) spraying disinfectant on our tables face cradles and other areas of the office that are heavily trafficked. Again this is usual protocol for myself and most therapists. The health and safety of our clients has always been our priority. I would also like to point out why the industry is so important. My client base alone much like many other therapists are people who use our service as part of their pain management. Many of our clients are just as eager to get back into our offices as we are to get back to work. For many of them this is a necessity not a luxury. The very definition of therapy is ""treatment intended to relieve or heal a disorder"". We are not simply establishments of amusement or entertainment but are in fact health care workers. I sincerely hope that you read this and would consider advocating for us to be opened up on Friday as well. We are a vital part of many people's lives and our livelihoods depend on it as well as small business owners. Sincerely AG.STATE.LA.US www.ag.state.la.us",political,Facebook
Do you care about Montana laws that protect the privacy dignity and integrity of Montana women?  Here is Mike Black's analysis of Justice Laurie McKinnon's record:  Justice McKinnons positions go against what the majority of the Montana Supreme Court has determined to be the law. Her attitude toward the fundamental right to privacy guaranteed by the 1972 Montana Constitution is particularly alarming and demonstrates she does not believe the Supreme Court should protect the right of a woman to use any legal procedure to terminate pregnancy before viability. Justice McKinnons anti-choice stance flies in the face of long-settled Montana law and betrays the fundamental right to privacy guaranteed by the Montana Constitution.

Hello my name is Martin Casey and I am running for LUSD school board. I made this decision earlier in the year before Covid struck. I have been volunteering at my childrens school in a variety of ways over the past few years (Classroom help PTA events chaperone for field trips School Site Council). During this time it became evident that change is needed at the district level to support students and teachers. After meeting several board members at a school event and realizing they have not had kids in school in decades I solidified my decision to run to affect change.  What I believe students come first and the teachers a close second. The role of the district is to assist and make the teachers lives as easy as possible so that they can focus on teaching. By not having them jump through hoops to get things done or impeding their teaching. The district needs a better handle on technology. the privacy and security policies for students and teachers in this time of distance learning is evermore pressing.  What I bring to the table is common sense no nonsense low tolerance for rigmarole and quick head for figures. I have passion for learning and making things better. I have over 20 years of experience working in a collaborative manner with people and groups who have competing interests due to my career field in access technologies. I am also skilled with reaching a consensus with different stakeholders to be able move forward and get the work done (this is from my time attending and for a time been in a leadership position (co-chair of the PhyTx) group at Broadband Forum an international group that produces standards that help define the networks the internet runs on today and in the future. The standards produced require consensus from all the stakeholders in order to be released).  A bit about me I and my lovely wife Rebecca have been married for 18 years and have two wonderful children who currently attend LUSD schools. I received my degree in Computer Mathematics from Carleton University in Ottawa Canada. I immigrated to the US in 1998 after getting a job offer and received my US Citizenship in 2013. Rebecca and I moved to Lompoc in 2005 and I have been an active member in the community through volunteering and charity. My career started in access technologies (how your house connects to the internet) and I continue to work in this field today. My family and I love to travel all over the world and take cruises during school holidays. My favorite food group is chocolate.  I have the confidence and necessary experience to bring forth the changes our students and teachers need. I hope you will support me for school board this November 3rd with your vote.  Thanks for checking out my page. If you have any questions please message me via the page. I work full time during the day so answers to messages maybe delayed until the evening. This page also has post moderation turned on please forgive any delays in having your post show on the page.,political,Facebook
Dear Dr. Adams  This letter comes to you from a veteran teacher of more than thirty years serving Connetquot families. I have dedicated more time love energy and passion than you could possibly imagine. This is a path I have chosen believing that our children truly are the most precious and important commodity we share.  I have read the districts plan several times over trying to understand how you think that this new plan you have dictated is best for our children. Perhaps you have not witnessed for some time what takes place in our classrooms.  You are the leader of this community and should consider what is best for all. I cannot express how disrespectful your mandate is not only to your teachers but also to our parents and students. You have single handedly removed the value of relationship building. Brava! Engaging students is a difficult enough task trying to engage the same clusters of students in person while teaching those on screen is truly ridiculous.  As a parent the very idea that someone would could monitor my child in someones class is really disgusting. Are we blacking out the images and names of our population? This is prime fodder for commentary on social media as well as bullying. Where is the privacy that should be afforded to each of us?  The lack of confidence you express in your teachers is both disheartening and reveals the insincerity of your intentions. The message I received slap up rote unimaginative lessons that any self-respecting teacher would shudder at. I will not compromise the integrity of my classroom nor the dignity of my students by disintegrating what has always been a safe space for them. Teaching live on screen is quite different than in person and this decision needs to be reexamined.  You are part of an exceptional community replete with talented and dedicated professionals who want to do the best for our children. As an educated person representing this community I urge you to reconsider this plan and value what the committee has recommended. I want to believe you will do the right thing.  Respectfully  Cheryl Sosa,political,Facebook
Lets Stop the State Legislature from Approving SB 1120 which Eliminates Single Family Home Zoning in California  SB 1120 is rushing toward approval in the California State Legislature. It could reach the Assembly floor as early as August 25 2020. If we have any hope of stopping SB 1120 we must all contact our Assembly Members by Tuesday August 25th to let them know that we oppose the passage of SB 1120 and ask them to oppose it as well. If State Legislators do not hear from their constituents this devastating bill that promotes high density housing in all of our neighborhoods regardless of current zoning will pass.  You can find out how to contact your State Senator or State Assembly Member here:    Senate Bill 1120 will eliminate single family home zoning in California by allowing developers to buy single family home lots as small as 2400 square feet and subdivide or split a single lot into two equal parcels and then each half could be turned into two separate duplexes resulting in a total of four housing units on one single family home lot. SB 1120 does not include provisions for yards or garages and off-street parking requirements would be reduced to just one space per home. So where you once had one home and two vehicles you would now have four homes and eight vehicles with provisions for only three extra parking spaces. Just imagine the parking nightmare residents would be subjected to if half of the single family homes on a block were converted to four homes per lot!  SB 1120 also allows local city governments to adopt ordinances to implement these urban and duplex lot conversions without being subject to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Without being subject to CEQA the bill would prevent any environmental review of public health and safety infrastructure traffic congestion utilities (water supply) sunlight privacy neighborhood character and quality of life. It is unacceptable that the public would have to live with the consequences of housing projects that were not fully vetted and whose impacts were not mitigated.  It seems that the only ones who benefit from SB 1120 are the wealthy developers who will build these new market-rate homes and the politicians who receive their campaign funds from the developers. It certainly does not benefit low income residents as it has no provision for low income housing and it most certainly will cause gentrification and displacement of low income residents who reside in homes that are demolished to make room for market-rate housing.  This is still a democratic State and we should have a right to choose the type of neighborhoods we live in. Please help send the message to Sacramento that we will not stand idly by while they pass laws that destroy our neighborhoods and diminish the quality of our lives!

Hi. I'm Steve Dutner. I am the Libertarian candidate for Illinois Secretary of Stete.  The Secretary of States office is no different from any other government agency in Illinois when it comes to overspending and inefficiency. So how do we solve these issues? One way we can do this is by opening up Driver Services to the free market presenting the consumer with more options.  Eighteen states in the US have either privatized or contracted out Driver Services. Since doing this almost all of the states have experienced shorter wait times across the board and a lower cost per transaction for the consumer.  In addition to saving costs by privatizing Driver Services cutting wasteful spending on grants and eliminating the front license plate requirement I will look to cut down redundancies between the Secretary of State police and the other ten state police agencies. Although House Bill 394 allows advertising on the Secretary of States publications it still limits who can advertise. Recently the Libertarian Party Comptroller Candidate Claire Ball won a case allowing the medical marijuana industry to donate to campaigns. With medical marijuana being legal in Illinois and full legalization of right around the corner there is no reason why a legitimate business like this should not be able to advertise. Government should abstain from the crony capitalism of picking and choosing with whom they do business. Although I use marijuana as an example many other businesses are not allowed to advertise either.  The Secretary of State's Office is responsible for investigating identity theft. Traveling around Illinois citizens have told me their concerns over protecting their privacy especially after seeing Equifax get hacked. I would like to make use of air gap technology and make the entire Secretary of States office PCI compliant.  We have had nearly twenty years with the current Secretary of State and the people of Illinois are looking for fresh new ideas. My Republican opponent wants to raise the age requirement to get a license to 18 preventing teenagers from getting a job going to after-school activities gaining life skills and earning money. I am offering a platform that considers all of your freedoms all the time and my only special interest is you. Believe in Steve on November 6th and vote to bring the Secretary of States office into the 21st century.,political,Facebook

THE 7 THINGS HUMANS DO NOT KNOW #4  WHAT IS IN A PERSONS MIND  Rabbi Yakov Saacks The Chai Center Dix Hills NY AUTHOR OF THE KABBALAH OF LIFE  In my previous writings we dissected the first three items that were withheld by God that we are not made privy to. The basic reason is that if this information were available it could create havoc and cause the world to be in total chaos and disarray.  THE FIRST THREE DEATH/GRIEF/JUDGEMENT The first item we discussed was death. We are not told the day we are going to die as this would lead to us taking advantage of this knowledge and abusing it. A person could do bad all his life and then repent a day before his demise and dodge the bullet. The only ones who definitely do know the day hour and minute are the ones who are on death row and even then the Governor could suspend or postpone the execution.  The second was grief. We discussed that the reason for denying us the knowledge of when our particular grief will end is because God wants us to work on our grief. We need to muddle through it and come out of it with a new perspective on life. If grief were to magically disappear it would stunt our growth.  The third was how the inner workings of divine judgement operate. We have no clue as to how God views things. Is it the quality of the good deed or quantity? Since God is the sole judge this should prevent us from judging others as we simply have no clue.  NUMBER 4  WHAT IS IN A PERSONS MIND There is no way to truly know what a person is thinking. We can guess predict and presume but ultimately it is completely hidden from us. Even though there are no mind readers to be found there are people who have an uncanny skill in being able to size up a persons character in literally minutes. I am not talking about the easy-to-read people like the auto warranty telemarketers as even my phone tells me it is a scam. I am referring to a consummate con man. Most of us have unfortunately been duped more than once. However there are people who literally have a sixth sense and masterfully avoid bad people.  THREE INTERPRETATIONS The Talmuds comment that we have no clue as to what is in someones mind has a number of commentaries postulating differing reasons as to why knowing what is in someones mind is impossible.  FREE WILL One commentary posits as follows if we could read someones mind we could then insert ourselves into their lives where we clearly do not belong and ruin someones design. We have been given a gift of free will meaning that we are the ones who decide what we should do in any given situation. We are free and clear to make our own decisions and not because someone is nudging you to do it or not do it for that matter. This gift by the way was not imparted to animals faunae or cherubs seraphim or any other type of angel. It is only human beings who have the ability to choose to do something even against its very nature. Therefore someone knowing our inner thoughts and directions can disturb our free choice and cause a disruption in the master plan. On a side note the free will element is why prison is so fearsome. In addition to being surrounded by unsavory people your free will has somewhat been marginalized.  MOTIVATIONS Another commentary focuses less on knowing someones plans and designs and rather focuses on motivation. What is the motivation of the person you are interacting with? If someone does you a favor you may ask yourself is the courtesy wholly altruistic or do they expect reciprocity of some kind a quid pro quo? The fact that we do not know the motivation behind the favor is very human and allows us to act as a human. If we knew a persons motivation it could and most likely would lead to excessive friction and major dysfunction.  In fact as far as motivation goes it is pretty low on the totem pole. You see a major principle in Judaism is that we stress the deed way more than the creed. In other words it is less important what one thinks or believes and it is far more significant what one does. It also does not matter what your motivations are as long as you act properly you are in good shape. As an example; it is really of no consequence whether you believe in keeping kosher and likewise it does not matter that you struggle with the reasons behind keeping Kosher. The main thing is that you keep kosher. The bottom line is this. Someone did you a solid. Therefore regardless of the reason just say thank you and mean it. They did you the kindness so they deserve the gratitude.  MODESTY AND PRIVACY Another problem with reading someone elses mind is that it is an invasion of privacy. This is another fundamental principle. I cannot begin to explain the great lengths Jewish law goes into respecting someones privacy. Did you know that according to rabbinic law by simply opening another persons mail one can be severely punished by excommunication as it is considered a vile invasion of privacy? Likewise when a woman makes an appointment to go to the Mikvah (ritual bath after menses) no one else is privy to the name and time except for the Mikvah attendant.

"URGENT UPDATE ON SENATE BILL 1120  The growing opposition to SB 1120 led to a new delay by the Assembly in voting on this devastating bill that will eliminate single family home zoning in California and turn local control of zoning over to the State of California. Here is a brief reminder of what SB 1120 is about:  ""Senate Bill 1120 will eliminate single family. home zoning in California by allowing developers to buy single family home lots as small as 2400 square feet and subdivide or split a single lot into two equal parcels and then each half could be turned into two separate duplexes resulting in a total of four housing units on one single family home lot.  SB 1120 does not include provisions for yards or garages and off-street parking requirements would be reduced to just one space per home. So where you once had one home and two vehicles you would now have four homes and eight vehicles with provisions for only three extra parking spaces. Just imagine the parking nightmare residents would be subjected to if half of the single family homes on a block were converted to four homes per lot!  SB 1120 also allows local city governments to adopt ordinances to implement these urban and duplex lot conversions without being subject to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Without being subject to CEQA the bill would prevent any environmental review of public health and safety infrastructure traffic congestion utilities (water supply) sunlight privacy neighborhood character and quality of life. It is unacceptable that the public would have to live with the consequences of housing projects that were not fully vetted and whose impacts were not mitigated.""  Senators' Toni Atkins and Scott Wiener did not have enough votes to get SB 1120 out of the Assembly today. The Assembly is now expected to vote on SB 1120 on Sunday August 29th. Assembly members will come under pressure from Senator Toni Atkins and her closest ally state Senator Scott Wiener to pass SB 1120. That is why we have to put even more pressure on Assembly members statewide to vote ""NO"" on this bill.  This is the second time this week the Assembly cancelled its vote on SB 1120 because of the pressure we have put on them. Help make this the final time by calling YOUR ASSEMBLY MEMBER HERE . Send an easy Oppose SB 1120 LETTER HERE . We only have until Sunday August 29th to make our voices heard.  We cannot let this attack on working and middle class single family home neighborhoods go unchallenged. We have a right to choose the type of neighborhoods we live in without the government coming along and forcing a way of life on us. Further the politicians we vote to represent us in the State Legislature should represent us not special interest groups.",political,Facebook
OKLAHOMA IS CHANGING!!!  I spent a couple of hours last night in two new Oklahoma City Cannabis Dispensaries The Peak and The Rabbit Hole both on 23rd across from O.C.U. within a block of each other. I was not prepared for what I found there. WOW!!! Never in my lifetime did I ever think anything like this would happen in my home state. Not in Oklahoma. Marijuana (roll after roll of glass canisters of it) of every possible description strength smell genre and variety; marijuana vapors in a thousand different flavors; edible Cannabis candies e.g. gummy bears and my personal favorite brownies; and a myriad of other food products (flour and seasonings infused with marijuana); that and every marijuana smoking paraphernalia I had ever seen before and then there were some new things added.  I shared my sense of wonderment with two close friends prominent iconic OKC attorney Bob Moore and former OKC Police Captain Dennis Berglan when I got home. You mean theyre selling marijuana  I cannot write the word marijuana the way that word left their lips mariwanna  in a store here in Oklahoma City both men asked surprisingly and incredulously. Both of these fellas are rock solid citizens and they were more than a little incredulous. They were thunderstruck. Bob thought the Rapture was surely upon us now. Bob is an O.C.U. alum and its fair to say he was convinced this is not what the student body or the university needed. Dennis was a good deal more inquisitive and curious and wanted to know everything I saw and experienced. Dennis was what you might expect from a trained homicide detective. He wanted to know nitty gritty. It was like telling a 3-year-old that there is a Santa Claus and here he is. It was exciting grist for Dennis curious mind. He hung on the smallest of details. Asked a million questions. We talked probably 30 minutes and when I told him I had to go Dennis still wanted to talk more about it. I told him wed talk more tomorrow.  There is an easy new breeze blowing through Oklahoma today. Some changes one can easily discern on the horizon today. Others will become more apparent as time moves on. One were never going back this way again. There are out-of-state and in-state Oklahoma interests doing business here today that are spending and making tens of millions of dollars already. This is a billion dollar a year business. The marijuana ship has sailed. Two Medical marijuana will inevitably lead to recreational marijuana especially now that both New York and Texas Governors announced their states are headed that way. Does anybody seriously think Oklahoma would sit back and watch Texas take in $350 to 450000000 a year in new state revenue and not do the same thing? And if we go the route Colorado did we know we can expect about $120 to 135000000 in new annual recurring revenue. Think about that. Thats almost exactly the size of the current hole in Common Education funding the State Of Oklahoma is in. The poetic justice and irony of marijuana being what saved Oklahoma public education is not lost on me nor I suspect you. Not for one minute.  There are other corollaries. Three this state has sent more than our share of people to prison and branded them felons for possessing small amounts of marijuana a privilege our state now sells and licenses for $100 a license. Although its clearly not enough  not nearly enough  to fix the grave injustices that was done going back two generations ago when we stigmatized and imprisoned some of the best and brightest of two generations of Americans we must now vacate those convictions. People I went to school with and who were a helluva lot smarter and better students than I was. We all lost because of that bad and immoral experience but those convictions must now be vacated. WHY? It was a bad idea to begin with but our current state policy is an implied admission that we in fact mistreated hundreds of thousands of our citizens. Justice demands those convictions be set aside in light of current state policy. We owe that much of an acknowledgement to my classmates who were wrongfully sent to prison.  Folks once prohibition was gone it was never going to return. And marijuana decriminalization is here to stay in Oklahoma. It never met the definition of a Class I drug but was always treated the same as heroin for historic non-scientific reasons. No longer. Common sense has finally come to drug enforcement. The inmate population is declining in the Oklahoma Department of Corrections for the first time in my entire lifetime. No more are there going to be drug nazis hiding among honest law enforcement like Lary Damron running around terrorizing and imprisoning children in the name of integrity.  Quite the contrary I recently heard an Oklahoma Sheriff who had a ton of insight say a very wise and mature thing: There are many many [Oklahomans] out there who like to go on their back porch in the evening in the privacy of their own homes and they like to smoke marijuana said Wagoner County Sheriff Chris Elliott who worked for 27 years as a Tulsa police officer before being elected sheriff. These are not what you would consider druggies or seedy people. These are people who work they pay taxes and they go to church. And theyve had to sneak around because theyve lived in fear of me law enforcement. I want more Oklahoma Sheriffs like this Sheriff Elliott. Hes got it exactly right. Can anybody imagine an Oklahoma Sheriff saying that 20 or 30 years ago. They would have been run out of the state.  No there really is an easy new breeze blowing through Oklahoma today and most of us hope its here to stay. I hope we continue to spend more and more money on public education and less and less on prisons. What a trend line!!!

"TAKE 5 DNL #11: JUNE 2018; WOULD YOU PAY $30000 FOR YOUR SON TO PLAY BASEBALL AT BASIC ACADEMY/HS IN HENDERSON NV? ADMIRAL BUSTAMANTE OF THE DESTROYER OF DREAMS RESPONDS TO MY REQUESTS FOR PUBLIC DOCUMENTS. RELATIONSHIPS PURGING AND LAWS OF THE UNIVERSE ARE OTHER TOPICS. STOP IN &/OR PASS IT ON  TIME has indicated for another 10000 word Dream News Letter. Before the story is told a Morning Verse should be shared. A Daybook of Grace quotes the following passage  THE DOOR OF HOPE  Never be lacking in zeal but keep your spiritual fervor serving the Lord. Be joyful in hope patient in affliction faithful in prayer. Romans 12:11-12  God is the only one who can make the valley of trouble a door of hope. Catherine Marshall  Think about it. If you had everything you wanted if there were no challenges in your life if you didnt have any questions about why things are the way they are and if you didnt feel there was something for you to accomplish that is bigger than your abilities; what would you have to hope for? Nothing of course. You would already have everything.  We know thats not the way the world worksbut sometimes we act and feel as though thats exactly what we believe. We seem surprise by problems and challenges.  We live in a world with fallen people. That accounts for so many of the trails we face. But beyond that God wants us to live in reliance on Him. For that reason He doesnt grant our every wish and give us everything our heart desires exactly when we want it. He wants us to grow in the ways that really matterpatience kindness self-control and other fruits of the spirit. (see Galatians 5:22-23 for a list)  Dont have everything you want right now? Well that gives you something to hope for!  LORD AS I WORK AND WAIT FOR VARIOUS BLESSINGS IN MY LIFE HELP ME TO GROW IN CHARACTER AND MATURITY. AMEN. (end of passage)  It has been over five years since my LIFE took a swim as a single fish in the Dream Fishbowl in Henderson NV. Four years ago spawned the creation of the Nick Feher TAKE 5 Foundation Facebook page. Three years ago my website became a reality. This story with images and photos can be found on my website by visiting the site and scrolling down the homepage until the story appears.  If only the written words are to your likings then continue reading. After you are done you are invited to see the DNL #11-photo album on my Facebook page that includes the images and pics used on the website. With different topics to choose from in this story feel free to skip around to explore your topics of interest.  Todays story begins with PURGING. A definition of PURGE from  1. to rid of whatever is impure or undesirable; cleanse; purify.  2. to rid clear or free (usually followed by of or from): to purge a political party of disloyal members.  3. to clear of imputed guilt or ritual uncleanliness.  4. to clear away or wipe out legally (an offense accusation etc.) by atonement or other suitable action.  5. to remove by cleansing or purifying (often followed by away off or out).  6. to clear or empty (the bowels) by causing evacuation.  7. to cause evacuation of the bowels of (a person).  writes; To purge is to get rid of something or someone and often its done suddenly. Purge rhymes with urge and when you have a really strong urge to throw stuff away or clean something out you have an urge to purge.  From the Latin purgare meaning ""purify"" purge is used as a verb for removing impure things whether they're guilty feelings in a person or rotten vegetables in a refrigerator. As a noun the act of tossing out the too-small clothes in your closet before getting new ones might be called a purge. It can be a very bad act too as when individuals have an unhealthy urge to purge or empty their stomachs after eating or when a military group decides to purge a certain ethnic group from a country. (End of definitions)  As one can read PURGING engulfs many meanings. Question Have you ever PURGED? If you have then you too have probably experienced the Emotions that accompany PURGING. Recently a PURGING for renovations in my Dream Fishbowl has been an ongoing project. The post-nuptial agreement a few years ago included that the Dream Fishbowl and many items remained in my possession. A 25 plus years Relationship that included 3 offsprings created a vast amount of items. PURGING is a TIME consuming activity for each item has to be handled and evaluated. There have been books and many articles written about PURGING.  My experience included dancing with Melancholy and other Emotions as I touched each item. Some describe PURGING as an Emotional Experience when one removes unwanted items from their LIVES. Some of the PURGING results in Gifts & Blessings to others as in donations of usable items. Other PURGING are just tossed in the recycle bin to give back to the earth that once created it or tossed out with the trash to be buried in landfills. Special PURGING is sometimes saved. This PURGING also releases old emotional bonds once held for these items making room to store new emotional bonds from newly formed Relationships with others and other items.  It was during this PURGING that the word Relationship also joined in as a partner. writes;  When you're in a relationship you're emotionally involved or at least connected in some way. If you're related to somebody  your parents your aunts and uncles your cousins  you share a family relationship with them. You can also use relationship to describe dealings between various groups as Members of the European Union have a relationship of economic interconnectedness or A lease helps define your relationship with your landlord. You'll also see relationship used with interactions that don't directly involve people. In many of these cases the word relation is better. For example in the sentence ""We are always looking at the relationship between ticket price and sales"" it would be better to use relation. (End of Definition)  It is a general consensus that Relationships could involve people items ideas nature music sports religions jobs careers hobbies and many other endeavors. After Nick physically passed on this planet the word Relationship morphed into a new meaning in my vocabulary. My new meaning became RELATIONSHIP is defined as TIME Well-Spent With Others With No Guarantees. In the natural scheme of the Universe Nick should have outlived my BUTT. However his Competitive Spirit clouded his judgement to TAKE 5 which resulted in his early demise. It was during my Journey after Nicks Physical Passing that the Laws of Universe formed a Relationship in my LIFE.  Prior to the Laws of the Universe my experience with other laws included The Laws of Man and The Laws of Religion. Marcelo Gleiser of writes about the Laws of Man We humans are an unruly bunch. So much so that we need laws to keep order to make sure we stay on track. Without our laws society would quickly descend into chaos. The laws of man are guarantors of order a necessary control against the inherent greediness of our species.  When one looks closely at the Laws of Man much of its contents are taken from the Laws of Religion. Depending on the region of the world this Relationship varies. Some societies base their Laws of Man to mirror closely their societys Laws of Religion. Other regions of the world may choose a different Relationship. My personal religious training consisted of Catholicism.  My BUTT & 2 BRAINS attended St. Joseph Roman Catholic Elementary Grade School 1-8 in West Aliquippa Pa. To escape the wrath of the nuns it was always a wise choice to attend daily mass before the start of each school day. To earn additional bonus points for entrance into Heaven my BUTT & 2 BRAINS became an altar boy. My performance would eventually earn the extra opportunities to assist with funerals weddings baptisms and Special Holy Days along with escorting the Roman Catholic priest for the Blessings of the Homes Ceremony. These extra opportunities also included monetary tips.  Part of the daily classroom schedule included strong portions of Catholicism being served. In addition to my Roman Catholic Relationship because of my fathers Relationship as Cantor with the towns Byzantine Catholic Church I was required to attend their Catechism classes. All other students in the Catechism classes were from the public school. Within the 2 divisions of Catholicism there are many more similarities than there are differences. However the major principles are the same. It was this Sameness that eventually led to my Unhealthy Relationship in Catechism class.  It began as a 3rd & 4th grader. Little did I KNOW at the TIME the Laws of the Universe started to play a role in my LIFE. Catechism classes were viewed by my BUTT as punishment of boredom. After my daily bombardment of Roman Catholicism by the nuns my BUTT & 2 BRAINS had to serve another 90 plus minute weekly sentence of Byzantine Catholicism that was taught by lay people cutting into my Playin TIME. As the most knowledgeable student in the room many of the questions were easily answered by my BUTT.  To express my Punishment of Boredom occasionally I would play Stump the Teacher by asking theoretical religious questions. If my theoretical question resulted in the instructor saying I will have to look into that and I will find an answer for the next class the Teacher was Stumped. As TIME went on my Reputation in Catechism classes grew. Instructors would not call on my BUTT for answers.  Theoretical questions resulted in phone calls to my parents or talks with my father. My parents offered their counseling but my pleas of Punishment of Boredom fell on their deaf ears. Eventually my tactics over TIME produced the desired results my BUTT sought. My parents grudgingly overturned my sentence. Catechism classes were for public school students.  Though my previous readings in LIFE had introduced the Laws of the Universe it was after the physical passing of Nick that they began to recirculate on a regular basis. This regular re-circulation brought attention to my BUTT & 2 BRAINS about the Relation of the Laws of the Universe and the word RELATIONSHIP.  A clarification of my BUTT & 2 BRAINS is warranted for all humans have them. An BUTT is simply defined as a Human Body. Each Human Body both male and female is under the control of 2 BRAINS. The Primary Brain is located in the skull and is responsible for all of the Human Bodys functions and conditions. In simple terms these conditions and functions are either controlled by the conscious or subconscious parts of the Primary Brain.  The Primal Brain is located in the genitals of the male and female. Merriam Webster defines the word genital as;  1. generative  2. of relating to or being a sexual organ  3. of relating to or characterized by the stage of psychosexual development in psychoanalytic theory during which oral and anal impulses are subordinated to adaptive interpersonal mechanisms (end of definition)  History has shown that a Human Body in TIMES of Wants Needs and Desires think and act with their Primal Brain before accessing the situation and or Relationship with their Primary Brains. This may or may not lead to the results that one sought.  Before my BUTT continues my Thanks have been sent via a Gratitude Letter to Queen Esther and Queen Jacquie for their Inspiration & Guidance for my last DNL #10. My regular Pen-Pals Danigirl & Batgirl were not available due to their other Relationships. It is with Great Joy to write that both Danigirl & Batgirl have found the TIME in their other Relationships to provide my BUTT & 2 BRAINS the Inspiration Guidance and Wisdom for this DNL #11. Recently a quiz was shared with them regarding the Laws of the Universe and Relationships. Next is the quiz.  A KNOWING can be revealed by Observing & Analyzing the Laws of the Universe during Every Day Life including the Relationships with Others. Using Our Relationship which is defined as Time Well-Spent with Others with No Guarantees as an example read each Law then Observe & Analyze if the Law is related to Our Relationship.  Then mark each with either Yes Maybe or No. There is no right or wrong answer. Instead of using Our Relationship as an example feel free to insert others. After you complete the assignment a KNOWING will be revealed. (Editors Note; with you currently as a reader one can consider that a Relationship has been formed with my BUTT & 2 BRAINS)  LAWS OF THE UNIVERSE-EVERYDAY LIFE & RELATIONSHIPS  The Law of Divine Oneness - everything is connected to everything else. What we think say do and believe will have a corresponding effect on others and the universe around us.  Law of Vibration - Everything in the Universe moves vibrates and travels in circular patterns the same principles of vibration in the physical world apply to our thoughts feelings desires and wills in the Etheric world. Each sound thing and even thought has its own vibrational frequency unique unto itself.  Law of Action - Must be employed in order for us to manifest things on earth. We must engage in actions that supports our thoughts dreams emotions and words  Law of Correspondence - This Universal Law states that the principles or laws of physics that explain the physical world energy Light vibration and motion have their corresponding principles in the etheric or universe ""As above so below""  Law of Cause and Effect - Nothing happens by chance or outside the Universal Laws.. Every Action (including thought) has a reaction or consequence ""We reap what we sow""  Law of Compensation- The Universal Law is the Law of Cause and effect applied to blessings and abundance that are provided for us. The visible effects of our deeds are given to us in gifts money inheritances friendships and blessings.  Law of Attraction - Demonstrates how we create the things events and people that come into our lives Our thoughts feelings words and actions produce energies which in turn attract like energies. Negative energies attract negative energies and positive energies attract positive energies.  The Law of Perpetual Transmutation of Energy - All persons have within them the power to change the conditions of their lives. Higher vibrations consume and transform lower ones; thus each of us can change the energies in our lives by understanding the Universal Laws and applying the principles in such a way as to effect change  Law of Relativity - Each person will receive as series of problems (Tests of Initiation/Lessons) for the purpose of strengthening the light within each of these tests/lessons to be a challenge and remain connected to our hearts when proceeding to solve the problems. This law also teaches us to compare our problems to others problem into its proper perspective. No matter how bad we perceive our situation to be There is always someone who is in a worse position. Its all relative.  Law of Polarity - Everything is on a continuum and has and opposite. We can suppress and transform undesirable thoughts by concentrating on the opposite pole. It is the law of mental vibrations.  Law of Rhythm - Everything vibrates and moves to certain rhythms.. These rhythms establish seasons cycles stages of development and patterns. Each cycle reflects the regularity of God's Universe. Masters know how to rise above negative parts of a cycle by never getting to excited or allowing negative things to penetrate their consciousness.  Law of Gender - The law of gender manifests in all things as masculine and feminine. It is this law that governs what we know as creation. The law of gender manifests in the animal kingdom as sex. This law decrees everything in nature is both male and female. Both are required for life to exist. (END OF QUIZ)  During the past 5 years as a single fish many Relationships with others have been formed. Most have been Healthy and some have been not. A Healthy Relationship provides many more favorable results than an Unhealthy Relationship. In my Dream Fishbowl a Healthy Relationship is defined with the four Is. Each I is identified as a Pillar that supports a Healthy Relationship. These four Is include Integrity Intimacy Insanity and Infinite Wisdom.  Simply defined Integrity is Say What You Mean Mean What You Say and Disagree Agreeably. Intimacy is sharing items of privacy such as thoughts in words and actions. Insanity or LOVE is Not Asking for Anything in Return. We do for others we choose with no expectations. The very least one should do is not hurt anyone intentionally with ones thoughts words and actions. Infinite Wisdom includes the Laws of the Universe. If one or more of the Pillars of a Healthy Relationship is considered Unhealthy this condition unless addressed will eventually result in a collapse of the Relationship.  Marcus Aurelius the Great Roman Emperor from 161-180 AD left many words of Wisdom for future generations. Unlike todays society that is governed by technology and bombarded by social media including the opinions of other with little facts and truths Aurelius lived during simpler TIMES. This simplicity permitted him to Observe & Analyze LIFE. The Laws of the Universe opened the door for my BUTT & 2 BRAINS to the philosophy of Marcus Aurelius. His take on LIFE is SIMPLE.  #1. The only thing a BUTT can control is what goes on inside its 2 BRAINS. The BUTT has no control over outside forces but only how the BUTT & 2 BRAINS decides to react to them. Since LIFE is an ART a BUTT and 2 BRAINS can paint the canvas of their LIFE according to its thoughts and reactions.  Other sharers of Wisdom have also agreed with Aurelius. As with any ART practice will be needed for the Game of LIFE. Trying to control ones thoughts and reactions takes plenty of practice. When the situation occurs to test ones practice remember the acronym FUDGE. Personally my BUTT and 2 BRAINS swam with FUDGE many TIMES after Nick physically passed.  F=FEELINGS U=UPSET D=DEPRESSION G=GUILT E=ENVY  No one person event or situation can affect the FUDGE of your BUTT & 2 BRAINS unless your BUTT & 2 BRAINS gives it permission. Once permission is granted only your BUTT & 2 BRAINS can decided the length of the swim with FUDGE. In other words A BUTT & 2 BRAINS is solely responsible for their LIFES ARTWORK.  #2. As with the opening Morning Verse Aurelius viewed obstacles and problems in the same take. He claimed that every BUTT has obstacles and problems in their LIFE. These problems and obstacles are created to entertain the BUTT & 2 BRAINS. If a BUTT had everything and every Dream turned into reality the BUTT & 2 BRAINS would die of Boredom. When the plate of Obstacles & Problems are cleaned the Laws of the Universe will serve another helping.  #3. Perhaps the most memorable passage of Meditations encourages us to view life as being in the words of the poet Rumi rigged in [our] favor. Its a powerful way of reframing any obstacle we encounter. Aurelius wrote:  True understanding is to see the events of life in this way: You are here for my benefit though rumor paints you otherwise. And everything is turned to ones advantage when he greets a situation like this: You are the very thing I was looking for. Truly whatever arises in life is the right material to bring about your growth and the growth of those around you. This in a word is artand this art called life is a practice suitable to both men and gods. Everything contains some special purpose and a hidden blessing; what then could be strange or arduous when all life is here to greet you like an old and faithful friend?  If one reviews closely the Morning Verse and the Wisdom of Aurelius the words Grow & Growth are included in their message. Numerous GREATS of the earths past also spoke of those two words. The moment that a BUTT & 2 BRAINS stop growing and making progress is the moment the Dirt Throwing will begin on that BUTT & 2 BRAINS. It is our duty and responsibility to maintain Homeostasis for our BUTT & 2 BRAINS. Simply put our BUTT & 2 BRAINS should function at the level of design for our age wants needs and desires.  Since all humans are in a Relationship with their BUTT & 2 BRAINS a human with its thoughts and actions can contribute to the Growth & Good Health of their BUTT & 2 BRAINS. All one has to do is Attend Nurture and Cultivate their BUTT & 2 BRAINS. Your entire body rebuilds or regrows itself in less than 2 years 98% in less than 365 days. Every day is a new opportunity to start building and growing a better healthier new body. This is called PRACTICE or ART. Once an BUTT & 2 BRAINS recognizes that their human body is worth over $6000000 in todays society swimming with FUDGE will be lessened for it stifles Growth & Good Health.  Relationships with others can be viewed by using the same principles. Prior to my door opening to the Laws of the Universe my BUTT & 2 BRAINS were constantly reminded that Relationships with others take work. My question for Growth and Good Health was If someone had a job/career or two why would one want more work?  As with LIFE and our BUTT & 2 BRAINS Healthy Relationships with others will have to be Attended Nurtured and Cultivated for Growth and Good Health. If not the Relationship with others as with LIFE and our BUTT & 2 BRAINS will become UNHEALTHY.  A replay is needed as my words move forward. Think about it. If you had everything you wanted if there were no challenges in your life if you didnt have any questions about why things are the way they are and if you didnt feel there was something for you to accomplish that is bigger than your abilities; what would you have to hope for? Nothing of course. You would already have everything.  When this Facebook page was created 4 years ago the intent was to accept a challenge to set-up a Facebook Community Page. The original Mission Statement included items of; Recognizing and Honoring the Past Present and Future members of the Ye Olde Henderson NV Baseball Community. To be a Driving Force to help bring a High School State Baseball Title back to Ye Olde Henderson NV. Encourage others to be a Difference Maker. And When in Doubt Remember to TAKE 5.  This Mission Statement created many Relationships for my BUTT & 2 BRAINS. Many of these Relationships have been described in previous writings on this Facebook page and my website. For you loyal readers my Mission Statement did produce the results as written. The Nick Feher TAKE 5 Foundation did Recognize & Honor the Past Present and Future members of the Ye Olde Henderson NV Baseball Community. A State High School Baseball Title returned to Ye Olde Henderson NV in 2016. Others were always encouraged to be a Difference Maker and to Remember to TAKE 5.  What was perceived as Healthy Relationships at that TIME with others in the Henderson Community eventually fermented into Unhealthy Relationships. The opening Morning Verse includes the words We live in a world with fallen people. My Unhealthy Relationships with these fallen people had one common theme. These fallen people did not practice INTEGRITY at all TIMES when dealing with the Nick Feher TAKE 5 Foundation which resulted in an Unhealthy Relationship.  These Unhealthy Relationships produced as Marcus Aurelius described a special purpose and hidden blessings for the Nick Feher TAKE 5 Foundation. Our record of accomplishment speaks for itself. Our INTEGRITY remains intact. We said what we meant and meant what we said. We also chose to disagree agreeably. These Unhealthy Relationships provided the Inspiration to create a New TAKE 5 Mission Statement.  This New Mission Statement revolved around DREAMS. Our Mission was and still is To Promote & Share the DREAMS of Others while at the same TIME Encouraging Others to Be a Difference Maker while remembering when in doubt to TAKE 5 and to teach others the Importance of Protecting Ones DREAMS. For if an BUTT & 2 BRAINS does not protect their DREAMS the fallen people will either stomp on them or take them leaving a BUTT & 2 BRAINS DREAMLESS. With that said it is now TIME for the next segment.  WOULD YOU PAY $30000 FOR YOUR SON TO PLAY BASEBALL AT BASIC ACADEMY/HS IN HENDERSON NV A PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL IN THE CLARK COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT?  If you said yes PLEASE STOP. Otherwise please continue. With limited inside information to the operations of captain Scott Baker on the Destroyer of Dreams the Basic Academy/HS TIME has provided along with Laws of the Universe plus Healthy Relationships to obtain financial information about the Southern NV Blue Sox. Recently without asking directly more financial data about the fees for paying players and families flew my way.  Previously it was roughly estimated that to play high school baseball at Basic Academy/HS in Henderson NV ranged about $5000 a season or a total of about $20000 for 4 years. In some cases with additional individual instruction and the hidden costs of traveling this range can be even higher. With no written disputes posted on our Facebook page $20000 seems realistic and undisputed. However with this new Fly-By info the new total costs for playing baseball at Basic Academy has increased with the fees associated with Summer Ball.  The Rule of Thumb in order to play high school baseball for the Destroyer of Dreams a player and his family must commit and pay the fees for 3 different baseball seasons. These seasons include Fall-Winter Baseball The High School Season and Summer Ball. Each season carries its own price tag. This Fly-By indicated that the cost for playing Summer Ball for captain Scott Baker and the S NV Blue Sox was about $2300. Individual instructions and costs for travel was extra. This fee of $2300 was to assist with the cost of Summer League games.  During my Quest for the Truth of My Insanity my BUTT and 2 BRAINS discovered the Magical Muck of Stupidity that had infected the once proud Battleship of Hope & Dreams turning it into the Destroyer of Dreams. I once penned the phrase There are no stupid people people do stupid things. If a person continued to repeat the same stupid thing and got the same stupid results the person would then be elevated to the status of an Idiot. Apparently this Magical Muck of Stupidity has infected Summer Baseball on the Destroyer of Dreams.  Please permit the numbers to speak for themselves. Without KNOWING the exact number of baseball games for a Summer Baseball Season 30 games will be used in my example. Feel free to plug in your number. $2300 divided by 30=$76.66 per game. That means each player and family will pay approximately $77 a game or $11 per inning. With only 9/10 players needed per game the 4-5 reserves pay a fee to sit and watch the game in high price seats from the bench. As a bonus each family member receives unlimited passes to watch the games as part of the $77 fee per game.  When a player and family adds Summer Baseball to their fees to play high school baseball at Basic Academy/HS the total costs for 4 years exceeds $30000. If you are reading this and agree that this is an example of the Magical Muck of Stupidity then please continue. If not PLEASE STOP!  As written previously my position is not to question the rationale on the whys parents do for their children. But as a Henderson Taxpayer and the Executive Director of the Nick Feher TAKE 5 Foundation and the author of this page my position is to question the perceived Discriminatory Unethical and Immoral operations of captain Scott Baker and the S NV Blue Sox under the direction of Admiral Bustamante on the Destroyer of Dreams the Basic Academy/HS.  It has been established that according to the regulations of the CCSD these operations are legal and permitted. However there are no regulations in the CCSD which supports that these operations are Non-Discriminatory Ethical and Moral.  My research for this story involved a visit to the Southern Nevada Blue Sox website. If one cares to visit just type their name into Google and the results will lead one to its website. The website is loaded with information including all the past and present players of the S NV Blue Sox. One can witness for their BUTT & 2 BRAINS the players and families who willingly contributed and paid fees to the Magical Muck of Stupidity to play high school baseball at Basic Academy/HS. (Editors Note instead of visiting the website the roster of past and present players and families of the S NV Blue Sox are posted in the album section of this Facebook page titled Dream Newsletter #11 Album)  One can argue that these Special Fees also contributed to the Discriminatory Unethical and Immoral Practices of Admiral Bustamante and captain Baker. Parents with sons on the roster can counter argue that they willingly contributed and paid fees to the Magical Muck of Stupidity to assist their son to PLAYIN in their DREAMS. But the question remains At what price?  Once a FEE has been set to play high school baseball at Basic Academy/HS only those players and families that can afford the FEE are deemed Worthy. If a family and player cannot afford the FEE they are deemed Unworthy with no recourse. In other words these Unworthy are PURGED from the opportunity to pursue their DREAMS of playing high school baseball at Basic Academy/HS in Henderson NV. The object of playing interscholastic sports at a high school level is to provide an equal opportunity for all participants to try-out and earn a spot on the team regardless of race color creed family income and other considerations. If this is true then why is this equal opportunity not provided for all baseball players and families in the Basic Academy/HS zone?  One of the selling points when setting up the Magical Muck of Stupidity with the operations of captain Scott Baker and the S NV Blue Sox was The Chance to Earn a College Baseball Scholarship. On their website the alumni of the SNVBS that played or are currently playing college baseball is listed. To the untrained uneducated naked eye the list looks impressive especially if a parent was not well versed in college baseball scholarships. Unless an untrained parent asks another parent whose sons name appears on the alumni college page and receives a Truthful Response for the exact amount of the Earned Baseball Scholarship one would not ever KNOW the worth of the college baseball scholarship or if one was earned.  The SNVBS college alumni baseball page is loaded with ambiguities. The following is intended to clean up the ambiguities. writes;  Types of Baseball Scholarships  Like all college athletics baseball is regulated by the three national collegiate sports associations. The NCAA NAIA and NJCAA set the rules by which baseball can be played at the college level. They also regulate the number of scholarships that colleges can offer as recruitment incentives for potential players. Unlike football and basketball however baseball is an equivalency sport. This gives coaches a bit more leeway in how they award scholarships and often coaches will divide their allotted full tuition scholarships into a greater number of partial tuition awards. In this way they can attract a greater number of top players to their teams.  Full and partial scholarships are the norm for baseball players at the college level and they can be hard to win. That being said high school baseball players who want to play on a college team should also consider walk-on scholarships. These are in essence general academic scholarships that can get the student to the college they desire where they can then try out for the team. Many well-known professional ball players used walk-on scholarships to make their name in college baseball.  NCAA Division I  There are 297 colleges and universities participating in NCAA Division I baseball. Each school is allotted 11.7 full ride scholarships for its team. Because baseball is a designated equivalency sport coaches are able to divide their 11 + scholarships into awards for up to 30 players. NCAA Division I baseball attracts only the very best and it is not unusual for players to be pinched by the big leagues before they enter college. Consequently students hoping to win a baseball scholarship to an NCAA college or university may be subject to last minute award notifications.  NCAA Division II  There are 242 schools participating in NCAA Division II baseball. Each school is allotted 9 full tuition scholarships per team for up to 30 players per team. Partial tuition scholarships are common in Division II as they allow coaches more flexibility in building a full roster.  NCAA Division III  NCAA Division III baseball consists of 408 programs at colleges and universities across the country. Division III schools are restricted from offering any baseball scholarships as a recruiting incentive. However general athletic grants and academic scholarships may be offered by some schools as a way of bringing talented players to their campuses. In essence these are walk-on scholarships and students will have to try out for the baseball team after they have been admitted to the college.  NAIA Baseball  NAIA baseball consists of 214 member schools across the country. Each school is restricted to 12 full ride scholarships for its baseball program and up to a 30 player roster. These may be full or partial scholarships administered as the coaching team sees fit. Students with strong academic backgrounds who also excel on the baseball field may qualify for a general grant or scholarship which will not count against the schools 12 scholarship limit. Again these are in essence walk-on scholarships and students will have to try out for the baseball team after they have been accepted to the college in question.  NJCAA Division I  NJCAA Division I baseball consists of 188 teams from junior colleges across the country. Each school is limited to 24 full ride scholarships to cover all expenses including tuition books registration fees and housing. (Schools do not have to fund all 24 scholarships.) Partial scholarships are not allowed.  NJCAA Division II  NJCAA Division II baseball includes 130 two-year colleges around the country. Each school is limited to 24 baseball scholarships. These scholarships can only cover tuition and cannot extend to housing or other expenses. Partial scholarships are not available.  NJCAA Division III  NJCAA Division III consists of 79 junior colleges. NJCAA Division III schools are restricted from offering any athletic scholarships as a recruiting incentive. While Division III schools may not offer baseball scholarships they can offer general scholarships and grants for students who excel in the classroom as well as the ball field.  writes;  College baseball scholarships are a sore subject for most college baseball players and their parents. That is because baseball scholarships are completely different than football and basketball. You see all NCAA Division 1 football and basketball players that are on scholarship (there are a few walk-ons) receive a full scholarship. No questions asked. Full tuition paid all fees paid all books bought and free room and board.  A NCAA Division 1 baseball team receives 11.7 scholarships to be split between 27+ different players. I have talked with three different recruiting coaches from the Big 12 Conference. All three said that no player on their team received a 100% scholarship. In fact the highest percentage on each team was 70%. The minimum scholarship a baseball player can receive is 25%. The 25% minimum is a recent change. Previously the coach could award any player between 1% and 100%.  Things even get a little worse at the Division II level. There are approximately 250 Division II level colleges and each one is allowed 9 scholarships for their baseball teams. These scholarships can be split up in any manner. However many of these colleges do not use or fund all 9 scholarships. Six scholarships for baseball are pretty typical for Division II schools.  And Division III level colleges are allowed to only issue academic scholarships.  NJCAA allows 24 scholarships for their Division I and II levels. Division I junior colleges can offer full scholarships: full tuition fees books and room and board. Division II junior colleges can only offer: full tuition fees and books. Division III junior colleges cannot offer athletic scholarships.  NAIA colleges are allowed 12 scholarships but again not all colleges fund all 12 scholarships. And very few if any baseball players get full rides.  Here comes the tricky part of college baseball scholarships trying to figure out what was just offered. A college might offer a 50% scholarship. But 50% of what? Are they offering half of the total college package (tuition fees books and room and board) or just half of the tuition?  There is a big difference between the two in cost. Probably the safest approach to finding out what you have been offered is to have everything broken down to cash. If a coach offers a 40% scholarship ask how much is the total cost for everything (including room and board) to attend this college and how much in cost value are you offering. Be sure to ask nicely.  The coaches will know the answers but they may try to steer you away from this question. Stick to your guns until you find out.  Michelle Kretzschmar from writes;  At the end of my sons last high school summer baseball season I was struck by the number of players who had graduated and didnt know yet where they were going to attend college. I heard a lot of talk from parents about maybe walking on to various teams and see what happens. These were good players the majority better than my son who did know where he was going.  I got the feeling that many of them thought that their sons would at the very least already be committed to a team if not holding an actual scholarship. Given the teams they were talking about walking on to it was obvious that they had spent the last four years watching their sons play baseball without ever really understanding the realities of college baseball scholarships. The fact that it was the summer after their senior year indicated that they werent necessarily up to speed on college application and financial aid deadlines either.  So if your son is playing high school baseball even if he is only a freshman its time for a reality check. The odds are that your son IS NOT going to get a full ride to college playing baseball.  Heres why. 11.7  11.7 is the maximum number of scholarships that NCAA Division 1 baseball teams can give to its players. Thats not per year thats per team for all players. Most D1 teams carry more pitchers than the number of scholarships they can award. To make the money go further many coaches award partial scholarships. Depending on the school this can still leave you on the hook for a hefty chunk of the tuition bill (thus the need to know financial aid deadlines). So if youre investing money in lessons and select/travel ball in the hopes of a full college baseball scholarship then youre making a poor investment decision. (END of QUOTES)  Hopefully that cleared up the ambiguities found on the SNVBS alumni college page. One added point to consider. If a Basic Academy/HS baseball player chooses a college outside the state of Nevada in most cases there will be an additional out-of-state fee for tuition. Usually this fee can be waved after a state residency is established which means year round housing costs. So what do you think? Is it a Healthy or an Unhealthy investment decision for a family to spend $30000 or more for their son to play baseball at Basic Academy/HS in Henderson NV? This is what I KNOW. Let the numbers speak for themselves.  For it to be considered a Healthy Investment then the cost of the college scholarship to play baseball has to either be equal to or greater than the investment of $30000 to the Magical Muck of Stupidity. If the cost of the college baseball scholarship is less than $30000 then the investment to the Magical Muck of Stupidity would be an Unhealthy Investment. With $30000 or more to invest in their sons college education only an IDIOT would not consult with an Investment Advisor before making a $30000 investment to Scott Baker and the Southern NV Blue Sox.  ADMIRAL BUSTAMANTE OF THE DESTROYER OF DREAMS RESPONDS TO MY REQUEST FOR PUBLIC DOCUMENTS  In my last DNL #10 it was written that Admiral Bustamante was in violation of the Nevada Public Record Act NRS 239 for not responding to my requests for certain public records stored in his office. As in tune with the Laws of the Universe the day DNL #10 was posted an email from an unknown entity landed in my mailbox. The email headline read something about the request for public documents. According to the Nevada Law one could argue that this reply did not meet the standards of the Law so the email was not opened and was not read. It was classified as a Moot Point.  It was stated in DNL #10 that out of courtesy another letter with a request for certain public documents would be mailed by my BUTT & 2 BRAINS to Admiral Bustamante. Since my previous request for public documents were included in personal letters to Admiral Bustamante research for form letters requesting public documents on the internet was conducted. With Integrity & Honor as my writing companions the following letter and Request for Public Documents was delivered by UPS to Basic Academy and signed for. (Editors Note; A letter was also mailed by USPS the same day to the supervisor of the local USPS in regards to my lost packages that my BUTT paid to have it delivered in 2 failed attempts to Admiral Bustamante. As of this writing no response from the local USPS supervisor.)  4/3/18  Gerald  My Gratitude is once again extended to you for your role in my ongoing Quest for the Truth of My Insanity.

Thank you for considering my request.  George N. Feher  WITHIN 5 WORKING DAYS A REPRESENTATIVE FOR ADMIRAL BUSTAMANTE SENT ANOTHER EMAIL MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE NEVADA LAW.  This is where my BUTT & 2 BRAINS stand. Please read again my letter. My email address was purposely not included. Since my email address was not included then why was not a mailed letter sent to my mailing address? With an email from an unknown representative in my mailbox the Nevada Law does not state a TIME limit for one to reply to a response from a public entity that received a request for the release of public documents. With that said a Road Not Taken has opened with a Fork.  My BUTT & 2 BRAINS can Open the email from the representative for Admiral Bustamante to examine the content for this Dream Newsletter #11 or It can remain unopened and unread until TIME and the Laws of the Universe dictate.  During My Quest for the Truth of My Insanity the Laws of the Universe gently coaxes one to LIVE in Simpler TIMES and to experience LIFE as an Olde & Faithful Friend. Call it Old School or whatever one chooses It is for best results that when problems and obstacles fill ones plate one should first find solutions for the most pressing problems and obstacles. Once the most pressing problems and obstacles are removed from ones plate then TIME will say when to tackle the other problems and obstacles that remain on the plate. Currently in my LIFE more PURGING for renovations and other chores for the Dream Fishbowl is the priority.  As one reviews my Request for Public Documents requests for certain items out of the jurisdiction of the Basic Academy/HS and the CCSD will not be filled. However Item #2 is within the jurisdiction of Basic Academy/HS and the CCSD and according to Nevada Law must be available for viewing and to make a copy. When TIME dictates the email from Admiral Bustamantes representative will be opened Observed & Analyzed.  After my BUTT & 2 BRAINS experiences a KNOWING INFINITE WISDOM will tell me what to do. Hopefully a story for DNL #12 will be a result especially if my BUTT & 2 BRAINS can compare Item #2 with the current and past roster of the SNVBS that is in my possession. When the rosters are compared How many Unworthy Baseball Players do you think made the Basic Academy/HS Official Baseball Roster during the reign of captain Scott Baker on the Destroyer of Dreams?  Please grant my story to run its course. With the finish line approaching it is TIME to once again to express my GRATITUDE to my Pen-Pals. If you are a loyal follower of this page my Pen-Pals have been written about before. Also one of them has been featured in numerous videos on this Facebook page.  Until a better answer can be found the Laws of the Universe were responsible for the formulation of our Relationship. After Observing and Analyzing this Relationship my BUTT & 2 BRAINS had a KNOWING which resulted in naming our Relationship. The name reflects the initial meeting of each Pen-Pal. It is called the Bizarre Epiphanic Phenomenal Vampyric Relationship.  Each Pen-Pal answers to multiple names including ones that I coined for them. Our Relationship is based on TIME Well-Spent with Others with No Guarantees and the 4 Pillars of Integrity Intimacy Insanity and Infinite Wisdom. Plus the Relationship is Attended Nurtured and Cultivated. After being Stunned with a Spell each granted my BUTT & 2 Brains entrance into their LIVES. When my Integrity & Honor passed their TEST more privileges were sent my directions. One of the Privileges was permission to Explore the Depths of their Truth Beauty Power Passion and Erogenous Zones.  It has been through a series of writings and ARTWORK that the Explorations has manifested and continue to this day. Permit my BUTT & 2 BRAINS to briefly explain this Bizarre Epiphanic Phenomenal Vampyric Relationship. It begin Mid-November of 2013 with a SMILE Handshake and Eye Piercing Gaze from a female named Danielle that resulted in my BUTT & 2 BRAINS being Stunned with a Bizarre Epiphanic Spell. A few of her other names include; Danigirl Dgirl Blonde Danigirl Blonde Dgirl God is My Judge Compassion D Queen Voodoo Vixen or QVV. Email addresses were exchanged which led to a series of writings that continued for over two years with a few small breaks. LIFE was the main topic along with Explorations.  As a gesture for our Relationship my GRATITUDE was extended by a Ticket to the Grand Opening of the T-Mobile Arena back in April of 2016. Though Danigirl accepted my invitation to meet my BUTT & 2 BRAINS at Stoneys she departed without the Ticket. The Laws of the Universe declared the Ticket would remain unused and my Pilgrimage to the T-Mobile Grand Opening would be a solo affair. It was during this Pilgrimage that the 1st Sighting of a Female Cellist unfolded. Her PASSION grabbed my attention.  After Observing & Analyzing this 13 piece Orchestra as they played on the outside stage Forces provided the opportunity to exchange info with the Leader. When told they were local and where to find them their Magical Sounds became a steady diet during the spring & summer months. This diet also included the female Cellist whose name was Sarah. She too goes by other names such as Batgirl Fabled Cello of the American West (FCOTAW) Cellobat Passion S Vampyre Sonata Queen Vampyre Sonata or QVS. The Orchestra Inspired my BUTT & 2 BRAINS to construct my 1st Musical-Story on my website titled David Perrico & His Minstrels.  It was during the Night of Sting at Cabaret Jazz in late September of 2016 with another Unused Ticket compliments of QVV. While the show played on another KNOWING appeared. As a steady Disciple of the Minstrels the only Musician on stage that my BUTT & 2 BRAINS had not formally met was Batgirl. If Forces agreed perhaps a Meet & Greet could be arranged after the show. The Laws of the Universe shined on my thoughts. For after the show a Meet & Greet was arranged. In a blink of an eye with a SMILE and Piercing Eyes plus a Cello Handshake Batgirl performed a Stun and cast a Phenomenal Vampyric Spell on my BUTT & 2 BRAINS.  A few months later QVS granted my request to write to her from Texas during my 2016 College Football Pilgrimage. One writing lead to another. Danigirl also remained my Pen-Pal as Intimacy was shared with her concerning the Adventures with Batgirl. My separate writings to both increased in frequency during the first quarter of 2017. Since Danigirl knew about Batgirl the Laws of the Universe dictated to level the Playin Field. My 1st novel was completed in May of 2017. It was a story of our Bizarre Epiphanic Phenomenal Vampyric Relationship. QVV received the first draft and after reading it with her permission a copy was emailed to QVS.  Signs then indicated that Batgirl also approved my 1st Novel that included a different ending. From that moment instead of writing 2 similar/different letters to each Pen-Pal the same writings were addressed to both and sent simultaneously to both of them via email which continues through this day. Results and Growth are by-products of this Bizarre Epiphanic Phenomenal Vampyric Relationship. Danigirl is the only person on this planet that has read my entire collection of stories on this Facebook page and my website plus all of my writings that were personally emailed to her. Though Batgirl was a late arrival she too has read a large part of my writings that are publicly available plus personal writings to her. In addition all personal writings to each of them starting with my 2016 College Football Pilgrimage have been exchanged between both of them.  Their INSANITY for my writings have been displayed in various ways. Public proof exists on Google Image Pages. To access Google Image Pages just open up Google and click on Images in top right corner. For my website Google Images are always used for accents plus a few may also be included in our Facebook Albums. It was during the writing of my 1st novel that my BUTT & 2 BRAINS were introduced to my Google Image pages. There are numerous ways for an image to appear on the page. Google with their tracking can snag an image off the internet that could be related for that specific image page and download it onto the page with or without an expiration date for removal. If one is adept at coding that too is an option which my BUTT & 2 BRAINS are not adept. If your TIME permits for verification open up a Google page and click the word Images.  Just type playinyourdreams or in the box on Google Images and witness for yourself their creation. Along with Google Both of Them have taken the TIME to download and code images from my website to be posted on my Google Image pages. As your mouse scrolls over the images it will identify if the image is from my website or not for sometimes junk from Google is added. If one clicks on the image another box will open and with another click on the visit box it will lead to my story.  Danigirl and Batgirl also have their own Google Image pages. Danigirl enjoys sharing her DREAMS with ideas and thoughts through words and images. Batgirl also enjoys displaying on her Google Image Page or GIP her DREAMS with words and images. Occasionally Images from will appear also on their GIPS. A few Images actually connect to all 3 GIPS. During visits to each GIP I always thank God for their creations especially when a new encrypted Image message appears.  It was during my 2017 College Football Pilgrimage while visiting the GIPS that Inspiration made a visit. To show my GRATITUDE for their TIME and messages ARTWORK was created and emailed to both of them. ARTWORK should be Original. Though a computer generated program could have created my ARTWORK it would not be Original only computer generated. Over TIME our Relationship through Intimacy revealed common interests and likes. On my website many photos and images are incorporated in my stories for a Story Picture Book effect. With plenty of personal images granted by Danigirl & Batgirl ARTWORK could be created.  Since my computer skills are not advanced Old School Technology with the use of Helen my Canon Power Shot A1200 camera would be used to generate the ARTWORK. It is one thing to send another an image via cellphone text or email. However when one sends Personal ARTWORK it adds value because of the personal touch. Without explaining more and if your TIME permits either visit my website for this story or visit the Dream Newsletter #11 Album posted on this page for examples. ARTWORK has many possibilities to expand on.  As the story ends Remember to PROMOTE and SHARE the DREAMS of others including YOUR OWN. Teach others including your BUTT & 2 BRAINS to PROTECT your DREAMS and When in Doubt Remember to TAKE 5.

Fort Zumwalt School District  Classroom Evacuations becoming Commonplace while Parents are Left in the Dark  This is a tough topic. It is important to remember that transparency open discussion and alignment with all is required to achieve goals through tough topics.  Trust transparency community alignment parent involvement; all are critically important to a students education. FZ policy makers seem to disagree. When it comes to classrooms being evacuated due to situations teachers feel are too dangerous for the class the rollout of safe spaces within all elementary classes and the encouragement of our students to make regular use of these spaces during what should be educational periods our district has acted in a manner that implies parents should be left in the dark.  Nearly three years ago a MO State Senate bill was passed that included a provision now referred to as the Trauma Informed School District. This bill kickstarted an important measure to support the fundamental learning blocks required for the development of successful students and successful young adults. In the bill was a call for a handful of districts to pilot the program and report back on the program success. The program is intended to look for ways school districts should provide emotional support to children within the class setting. The concept is based on the basic principle that one must feel safe to learn.  Unfortunately our district has implemented this policy in a manner that has had impacts to large numbers of students. Our district has quickly moved to place a higher priority on the emotional safety of some students over the physical safety of many students.  While not every school has been impacted in the same manner many new issues are arising within several of our schools. These issues are a direct result of how the district has implemented this social policy and worked to keep parents in the dark and not involved.  The result?  The result is that students as young as six years old are being routinely evacuated from their classrooms for potentially dangerous situations regarding other classmates. They are shuttled into other classrooms or the gym to shoot basketballs until the situation is under control.  They are being taught that evacuation drills not from outside threats but rather inside threats are normal.  They are being taught that special areas such as carpets or camping tents in classrooms to act as safe spaces is part of the new norm. They are being taught to use those spaces as they see fit.  They are being taught that actions do not have consequences and that their physical safety is not as important as anothers perceived privacy.  They are in cases being physically hit abused bullied and learning that those trusted to help keep them safe are unable to prevent it from happening again.  I learned of this not because I was informed by a district committed to parent alignment and communication but rather through one off comments and deeper personal investigation. I have since talked with other families that only learned about this after questioning their children following our discussions. I have talked with parents whose children that once loved going to school now begin to cry at the thought of going due to fear of what may again happen.  As I began to learn how deeply this program had been implemented I went to the school and the district and I asked questions. I pushed for answers.  When I asked why this was happening when it would be ended I was told that this was a policy implemented by the Fort Zumwalt Board of Education and that as a parent there was nothing I could do about it. It was made apparent that our children as young as six and seven were expected to be an emotional support provider. I was told that more information could be provided by a consultant psychologist on the Fort Zumwalt payroll that was instrumental in the bill as well as the roll out of this policy within FZ.  After cancellations he did give a speech on this topic. He spoke to the goal of the program and the need for a village but the village concept broke down when asked about parent involvement feedback and ongoing review.  I asked if teachers were provided a safe and anonymous path to provide their feedback on the implementations of this program. I was not given an answer.  I asked if parents should be notified if their child is evacuated from a classroom due to a violent or dangerous situation. I was told no. I was told that the school alone will make the judgement on what a parent should be told and whether an event was traumatic to a child. I was also told that notifying a parent may impact the privacy of the child that caused the evacuation. In this response I was told that the privacy of that child was more important than the alignment of a parent with their own child over traumatic and dangerous situations.  I asked if a parent should be notified if their child is being encouraged to use a safe space of if a child feels the need to use a safe space on a regular basis so the parent can help their child. I was told no again. I was told that the parents should not be notified or told but that ultimately the classroom teacher could do so if needed.  Finally I asked how this program would be monitored for success. I was told to contact my state rep. This is an unacceptable response to a Zumwalt policy.  Our parents work hard to provide a quality education free from fear to their children. They work hard to be involved in that process. Our teachers work hard to drive forward a positive relationship with the children they teach and their parents. Divisive policies destroy the trust between teacher and parent school and community.  Communication is extremely important. We place the trust of our childrens safety in the hands of this district every day and they have a responsibility to uphold that trust. Unfortunately this BOE and district has decided that when their social policy may differ from parent desire the parent can simply be removed.  As a member of our board I will end policy implementation that seeks to distance the parent from their child and puts family and teacher relationships at odds. I will work with our families our community and our teachers to implement policy in a manner that brings all together through communication and transparency.

"Another hidden terrible fact coming into light. As though it was not enough that almost everything is coming from China including vital life saving medications and equipment such as antibiotics and ventilators and masks and food and much more.The problem is that it is much much more worse ! The Chinese government which owns China Telecom and China Unicom may have been engaging in malicious cyber activity and economic espionage and disruption and misrouting of US communications. Guess who is the global leader in the next generation 5G technology ! Yes CHINA !. Forget the privacy issues which are non existent and long gone this is a real National Security Crisis. We are dependent on China for EVERYTHING !!!! The FCC has been awakened by President Trump now and voted to deny China Mobile to provide services in The US. ""leaders"" and politicians have been betraying us for years in this country. We were sold to the highest bidder and in most cases sold for nothing at least NOTHING for The People ! China is in a geopolitical economic and technological competition if not war with the US. Unlike us they have a united government led by ""wise and ambitious leaders"" not governed by ""democracy or opposition"" ! Not our values but very efficient and determined with very specific short and long term goals. In the past in the US we were united when it came to foreign policy despite any domestic rivalry and disagreements. That is no longer the case at GREAT COST to the country.  Thank you China for all you have given us including the Corona Virus the latest export to us. That we got real cheap FOR FREE !  Our jobs were sold for pennies on the dollar our security and technology our medications everything including our world leadership. Those in control for at least the last three or four decades were sleeping at the switch. For the past almost four years it has been dirty politics and division and impeachment and self destruction while the Chinese and the Russians and others are laughing at us. It is time to reverse the damage ! The swamp is so deep that it is almost impossible to drain but if any President could succeed it is President Trump. The ""deep state"" has to be annihilated before 'the hidden government"" destroys the ""legitimate government"" and this country with it. MAGA Made in America is what I want !",political,Facebook

To all citizens of Carroll County  The Life Center of Galax is looking to purchase and move to the old Training Center in Woodlawn.  Training Center Tax value $9+ million with 98+/- acres and buildings. State is selling for ridiculous $4 million or best offer very quietly.  The Life Center is a drug/addiction treatment facility in downtown Galax.  It is our understanding that the people coming for drug treatment to the facility will mostly be doing so as part of a Prison sentence drug court deferment program. ( you either go to jail for your crimes or rehab if youre blaming the drugs)  We here in Carroll County support treatment and people getting help. Only requesting from Facility that it be privacy fenced and secured with minimum of two 24 hour security guards each 8 hour shift to cover the 95 acres and hundreds of patients as well as not cost our County unreasonable tax burdens.  That being said we have all heard of the serious problems that the surrounding community in Galax has had to endure because of this facility being located in a residential area.  The facility in Galax has some 400-500 911 Emergency Police and EMS calls to their locations every year. The Training Center in Woodlawn would accommodate 10 times as many people therefore a realistic expectation of several thousands of 911 Police and EMS calls per year.  Our understanding from the chief of police in Galax are these calls include theft weapons drug possession assault stolen property trespassing breaking and entering drug dealing stolen property credit card fraud just to name a few.  This could possibly crush our local 911 call center leaving citizens all over Carroll County without Police or EMS available in our time of need because they are tied up at the Woodlawn drug treatment facility. This volume of expected calls would also create a burden on our local government financially which would raise our taxes while the drug treatment facility clears millions of dollars in profits.  The citizens of Carroll county need to make their feelings known to the board of supervisors that if any facility locating in Carroll that is known to have these type problems already happening be either zoned to non residential areas with conditions or prohibited in the county. ( if the board of supervisors can create an ordinance against fortune tellers then surely this is a no brainer)  Board of Supervisors meeting is May 10th 2021 at 6pm on the second floor of the Carroll County Courthouse Complex.,political,Facebook

Prayers Answered! Be safe and keep a watchful eye!  Northwest District For more information contact Customer Service at 888 ASK MODOT (1-888-275-6636)  July 19 2019  Route 41 Now Open U.S. Route 65 remains closed  CARROLLTON Mo.  One more route in Carroll County was able to open today with restrictions. Route 41 to Miami opened today but to one lane only. Traffic signals are in place to direct traffic.  Earlier this week it was thought that the road would stay closed until repairs could be made by a contractor but after further assessment and some monumental efforts by crews from the Missouri Department of Transportation partial mobility has been restored on the route. Further work by a contractor will be necessary though. The road could remain open to only one lane until the contractor work is completed. If the Missouri River rises again the road could be closed with little or no notice. We will do our best to keep the public informed but flooding conditions can change rapidly.  U.S. Route 65 south of Carrollton remains closed with water over the roadway. Floodwater remains so high that damage to the road surface and the road bed are not yet exposed and no assessments can be made. Crews continue to monitor water levels and are making repairs and clearing debris as they are able but many parts of U.S. Route 65 are still inaccessible due to high water.  While prolonged closures are a burden on many for your own safety and the safety of those who may follow you do not move barricades. Barricades are in place for your protection. As soon as the roadway is safe for motorists we will remove all barricades.  If you come upon a flooded roadway without barricades do NOT drive through the water. Pull over to a safe location and call the MoDOTs 24-hour Customer Service line at 888 ASK MODOT (1-888-275-6636) to report it.

"My Platform Thank you for reading my platform. I hope you will also find time to read the platforms of the other candidates. Compare. You will see basic differences in how we propose to represent you. I believe in less government less spending less inflation. In other words I want you to retain more of your own money money that represents the worth of your labors to use as you see fit for the necessities and conveniences of life. Is bigger government really what you want? Make no mistake: you cannot have bigger programs and less government. You must choose. Every dollar spent by government is a dollar earned by you. The government must always ask: Are your dollars being wisely spent? Can we afford it? Is it not better for the state to leave your dollars in your pocket? Your elected officials their appointees and government workers are expected to perform their public acts with honesty openness diligence and special integrity. At the heart of our system must be the confidence that these people are always working for you. I believe that liberty can be measured by how much freedom you have to make your own decisionseven your own mistakes. Government must protect your constitutional rights. Government must assure equal opportunity. And government must be compassionate in caring for those citizens who are unable to care for themselves. I believe that government action should be taken first by the government that resides as close to you as possible. Governments tend to become less responsive to your needs the farther away they are from you. Thus I prefer local and state government to national government and decentralized national government wherever possible. Your initiative and energy create jobs our standard of living and the underlying economic strength of the country. Government must work for the goal of justice and the elimination of unfair practices but no government has yet designed a more productive economic system or one which benefits as many people. The beauty of our land is our legacy to our children. It must be protected by us so that they can pass it on intact to their children Our great American Republic was founded on the principle: ""one nation under God with liberty and justice for all. It was our ""Declaration"" which put the world and posterity on notice ""that Men are...endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights"" and that those rights must not be taken from those to whom God has given them. Jobs and Inflation I believe it is of paramount importance that the Louisiana people understand that the number one destroyer of jobs in the state is government over taxation and regulation. Inflation is the direct responsibility of a spendthrift state government that has been unwilling to discipline itself to live within our means. The temptation to spend and deficit spend for political reasons have simply been too great for most of our elected politicians to resist. Individuals and families must live within a budget. Why not our state? If we are to eliminate high unemployment it is essential to change the state's business atmosphere to be attractive to new businesses. Job creation can only be accomplished in the private sector. Louisiana we must not be fooled into accepting government as the employer of last resort. The people of Louisiana are beginning to understand that no government can ever add real wealth to an economy by increasing tax rates or by creating credit out of thin air. All government can do is confiscate and redistribute wealth. No state can spend its way into prosperity; it can only spend its way into bankruptcy. Taxes and Government Spending I recognize that tax policies and spending policies are inseparable. If government spending is not controlled taxes will inevitably raise either directly or through inflation. Government spending needs to be tied directly to income Every American knows he cannot continually live beyond his means. It is time the Government realizes the same thing. I advocate a legislative policy to obtain a balanced state budget and reduced tax rates. While the best tax reform is tax reduction we recognize the need for structural tax adjustments to help the working men and women of our state. To that end I recommend tax credits for college tuition postsecondary technical training and childcare expenses incurred by working parents. Our tax laws have become a nightmare of complexity and unfair tax preferences virtually destroying the credibility of the system. Simplification should be a major goal of tax reform. I support economic and tax policies to ensure the necessary job-producing expansion of our economy. These include hastening capital recovery through new systems of accelerated depreciation removing the tax burden on equity financing to encourage more capital investment ending the unfair double taxation of dividends and supporting proposals to enhance the ability of our working and other citizens to own ""a piece of the action"" through stock ownership. Health Every American should have access to quality health care at an affordable price. The possibility of extended illness in a family is a frightening prospect but if it does happen a person should at least be protected from having it wipe out lifetime savings. Catastrophic expenses incurred from major illnesses and accidents affect only a small percentage of Americans each year but for those people the financial burden can be devastating. I support the extension of catastrophic illness protection to all who cannot obtain it. We should utilize our private health insurance system to assure adequate protection for those who do not have it. Such an approach will eliminate the red tape and high bureaucratic costs inevitable in a comprehensive national program. I oppose compulsory national health insurance ""Obama Care"". The most effective efficient and economical method to improve health care and extend its availability to all is to build on the health delivery and insurance system which covers nine out of every ten Americans. A coordinated effort should be mounted immediately to contain the rapid increase in health care costs by all available means such as the development of healthier lifestyles through education improved preventive care better distribution of medical manpower emphasis on out-of-hospital services and elimination of wasteful duplication of medical services. I oppose excessive intrusions in the delivery of health care. I believe in preserving the privacy that should exist between a patient and a physician particularly regarding the confidentiality of medical records. State health programs should be consolidated into a single grant to each parish where possible thereby allowing much greater flexibility in setting local priorities. Our rural areas for example have different health care delivery needs than our cities. State laws and regulations should respect these differences and make it possible to respond differently to differing needs. Fraud in Medicare and Medical programs should be exposed and eliminated. We need a comprehensive and equitable approach to the subject of mental health. Such a program should focus on the prevention treatment and care of mental illness. It should cover all aspects of the interrelationships between emotional illness and other developmental disabilities that seek to remove us from the dark ages in these areas. Alcoholism and drug abuse growing problems in Louisiana today should receive the utmost attention. Small Business I recognize that small and independent business is the backbone of the American competitive system pledge myself to strengthen this vital institution. Small business so vital to our economic system is free enterprise in its purest sense. It holds forth an opportunity for the individual regardless of race or sex to fulfill the American dream. Small businesses are the base of our economy and its main source of strength. Some 9.6 million small firms generate 55 percent of our private employmentor the livelihood of over 100 million Americans. Yet while small businesses have a unique place in our society they also have unique problems that government must address. Therefore we recommend that the Small Business Administration (SBA): Assure adequate financing to those creditworthy firms that cannot now obtain funds through conventional channels; Include the proper mix of loan programs to meet the needs of the many different types of firms that constitute the American small business community; Serve as an aggressive advocate for small businesses and provide procurement management and technological assistance. For survival small businesses must have relief from the overwhelming burden placed on them by many regulatory bodies. Paperwork proliferation has grown out of control and small business is not equipped to deal with this aggravation. The present tax structure does not allow small firms to generate enough capital to grow and create jobs. Estate taxes need liberalization to benefit the family business in the same manner as the family farm. Encouraging investment in small businesses through more equitable tax treatment remains the best and least expensive method of creating productive employment. Bureaucratic Over-regulation I believe that the extent of state regulation and bureaucratic interference in the lives of the people must be reduced. The programs and activities of the state government should be required to meet strict tests of their usefulness and effectiveness. In particular I consider an essential analysis of the extensive growth of laws and regulations governing production processes and conditions and standards or consumer products to determine whether the services and benefits the people of Louisiana receive are worth the price they are paying for these services in higher taxes and consumer prices. I am intensely aware of the need to protect our environment and provide safe working conditions in American industry while at the same time preventing the loss of jobs and the closing of small businesses through unrealistic or over-rigorous government regulations. I support a balanced approach that considers the requirements of a growing economy and provides jobs for Louisiana workers. The average businessman and employer is being overwhelmed by government-required paperwork. I support legislation to control and reduce the burden of state paper-work. Government that Works I believe Louisianans are fed up with and frustrated by a government that makes great promises and fails to deliver. I am! What we now have is a government organization that doesn't make any sense. It has not developed by design. It just grewby whim bureaucratic fighting and then caving into special interest demands. So today we find that nine federal departments and twenty independent agencies are involved in education; seven departments and eight agencies in health; federal recreation areas are administered by six agencies in three departments; and so forth. There must be a functional realignment of government instead of the current arrangement by subject areas or constituencies. I want departments to reflect on the major purposes of government such as natural resources human resources community development and economic affairs. Now we must insist that attention must be paid. Veterans As a combat veteran that uses the VA I understand better than most that: The nation must never forget its appreciation and obligation to those who have served in the armed forces. Because they bear the heaviest burdens of war we owe special honor and compensation to disabled veterans and survivors of the war dead. I am firmly committed to improving our Veterans Administration hospital system. Younger veterans especially those who served in conflict deserve education job and housing loan benefits. We must continue to provide for our veterans at their death a final resting place for their remains in a national or state cemetery and the costs of transportation thereto. Older Americans Older Americans constitute one of our most valuable resources. Families should be supported in trying to take care of their elderly. Too often government laws and policies contribute to the deterioration of family life. Our tax laws for example permit a deduction to the taxpayer who gives a contribution to a charitable institution that might care for an elderly parent but offer little or no incentive to provide care in the home. If an elderly parent relinquishes certain assets and enters a nursing home the parent may qualify for full Medicaid coverage but if parents live with their children any Supplemental Security income benefit for which they are eligible may be reduced. Incentives must be written into law to encourage families to care for their older members. Along with loneliness and ill health older Americans are deeply threatened by inflation. The costs of the basic necessities of lifefood shelter clothing health care have risen so drastically as to reduce the ability of many older persons to subsist with any measure of dignity. In addition to our program for protecting against excessive costs of long-term illness nothing will be as beneficial to the elderly as the effect of this Platform's proposals on curbing inflation. The Social Security benefits are of inestimable importance to the well-being and financial peace-of-mind of older Americans. We cannot let the Social Security system fail. I will work to make the Social Security system sound. The Social Security program must not be turned into a welfare system based on need rather than contributions. The cost to employers for Social Security contributions must not be raised to the point where they will be unable to afford contributions to employees' private pension programs. I will work for an increase in the earned income ceiling or its elimination so that as people live longer there will not be the present penalty on work. The Medicare program must be improved to help control inflation in health care costs triggered by present regulations. Other areas of concern to the elderly that need increased attention are home and out-patient care adequate transportation nutrition daycare and homemaker care as an alternative to costly institutional treatment. A nation should be judged by its ability to help make all the years of life as productive and gainful as possible. This nation still has a job to do. Welfare Reform The work of all Americans contributes to the strength of our nation and all who are able to contribute should be encouraged to do so. In every society there will be some who cannot work often through no fault of their own. The measure of a country's compassion is how it treats the least fortunate. I appreciate the magnificent variety of private charitable institutions that have developed in the United States. The Congress has produced a jumble of degrading dehumanizing wasteful overlapping and inefficient programs failing to assist the needy poor. A systematic and complete overhaul of the welfare system should be initiated immediately. The following goals should govern the reform of the welfare system: (1) Provide adequate living standards for the truly needy; (2) End welfare fraud and prevent it in the future with emphasis on removing ineligible recipients from the welfare rolls tightening food stamp eligibility requirements and ending aid to illegal aliens and the voluntarily unemployed; (3) Strengthen work requirements particularly directed at the productive involvement of able-bodied persons in useful community work projects; (4) Provide educational and vocational incentives to allow recipients to become self-supporting; (5) Better coordinate federal efforts with local and state social welfare agencies and strengthen local and state administrative functions. I oppose federalizing the welfare system; local levels of government are most aware of the needs of their communities. Consideration should be given to a range of options in financing the programs to assure that state and local responsibilities are met. Those features of the present law particularly the food stamp program that draws into assistance programs people who are capable of paying for their own needs should be corrected. The humanitarian purpose of such programs must not be corrupted by eligibility loopholes. Food stamp program reforms need to accomplish the twin goals of directing resources to those most in need and streamlining administration. We must never forget that unemployment compensation is insurance not a welfare program. It should be redesigned to assure that working is always more beneficial than collecting unemployment benefits. The benefits should help most the hard-core unemployed. Major efforts must be encouraged through the private sector to speed up the process of finding jobs for those temporarily out of work",political,Facebook
THE TEN COMMANDMENTS AS IT RELATES TO ELECTRONIC HARASSMENT  1) Though shall not bear false witness against thy neighbor.  This important Commandment as it relates to my own situation is very important because I have been lied to kept from the truth AND people have called the police for my behavior to torture and they called it something other than it really is.  2) Though shall not steal.  My captors have stolen a very sacred place only reserved for one: God inside my head with V2K. My freedoms and rights have been stolen through speaking for me (like with the Mediation Center) an issue of Freedom of Speech invading my privacy which is my own body being punished for something in a cruel and unusual way and had no opportunity to defend myself which violates my Due Process rights according to the Constitution  3) Though shall not murder.  Because of advanced periodontal disease caused by my captors there are a number of things that could lead to an earlier death than would be normal. Also I'm quite certain that microwaves aimed at my head (radiation) can't really be helping me live a more prolonged life and likely makes me susceptible to too many cancer risks than I care to name off.  4) Though shall not make an idol gods.  My captors are in love with the technology that gives them all a God-like view of my world. They are putting the technology ahead of their own faith in the all powerful God and instead worship the devil technology.  5) Though shall not put any other gods before me.  MY captors playing musical chairs with God inside my head ripped a chair away and left God no space to communicate with me since they filled my days and nights with the voices of themselves and playing God trying to get me to move from the home I own.,political,Facebook

Because you voted Libertarian when it seemed hopeless we had a growing Libertarian Party a record-shattering presidential campaign in 2016 and a currently exploding Libertarian movement nationwide. Your early Libertarian votes allowed us to put political pressure on the two main parties and unite Libertarian minded individuals. Because of those Libertarian votes we are on the path to legalizing marijuana in every state as the first step to ending the War on Drugs. That political pressure helped make homeschooling possible in every state as a first step to getting the government completely out of education. Those votes helped to fuel the battle for gay rights with gay marriage now legal in all 50 states. That is one massive step in the process of getting government completely out of marriage and completely out of the bedroom. Those Libertarian votes made a powerful movement that is now fighting for privacy rights against unfair regulation against taxes and tariffs. Each year we are blocking new government while fighting to reduce the size scope and power of existing government. Those Libertarian votes helped to fuel the Libertarian movement and the many organizations that are helping it grow. Because you voted Libertarian and worked so hard to keep the party alive through it's hardest times there is now a home for so many great activists and freedom fighters. If you hadn't voted Libertarian there would have been no Johnson/Weld 2016 campaign. Or Johnson/Gray 2012 campaign. Each of your Libertarian votes was a vote to continue the struggle for freedom to refuse to give in to government interference theft and oppression. Last week I was proud to continue that growing tradition when I voted early on a ballot list that had NUMEROUS Libertarian Party Candidates. The 2018 election cycle has broken so many records for the Libertarian Party and we have plenty more to break. But none of that would have been possible had you not voted Libertarian in the past.

"I believe in a stronger Anderson County  VOTE FOR FRANK PRESSLY TUESDAY June 12 2018 ANDERSON COUNTY COUNCIL DISTRICT 4  I BELIEVE...  I believe in personal responsibility limited government free markets individual liberty personal privacy the freedom to worship your God as you see Him traditional American values and a strong national defense. I believe the role of government should be to provide people the freedom necessary to pursue their own goals.  I believe the Second Amendment protects us not only from foreign invaders; but also from a tyrannical government and a police state.  I believe raising taxes and charging fees to fund non-essential services should be the tool of last resort AFTER all other remedies such as sponsorship and strategic retail alliances to pay for those desires have been exhausted. We must separate our wants from our needs with a focused path for both. Our needs to be paid with taxes and our wants to find its own funding.  I believe we need to provide opportunities to make it possible for poor and low-income workers to become self-reliant. It is far more compassionate and effective to encourage a person to become self-reliant rather than keeping them dependent on the government. I firmly believe people choose crime as a last resort and would prefer a life of self-empowerment by educating themselves and enhancing their earning power to fulfill their dreams.  I believe in a bureaucracy that is professional willingly accountable and has a priority to find ways to do more with less. I believe in a county employee that is more interested in performance than job security. Smaller transparent and more effective government should be our goals. In the pursuit of that I believe all county management should be limited to four levels deep beginning from where the rubber hits the road. I believe that if a county employee cannot perform 95% of the tasks and expectations of their job and have to farm out their work to ""specialists and consultants"" then we don't need that position. Their manager could just as easily assign a needed service to ""specialists and consultants"" and do away with the $100000 intermediary holding that position. We must pull back re-evaluate and monitor with vigilance the ""powers"" we have bestowed on the bureaucracy. It has already been demonstrated how unscrupulous people can take advantage of us with impunity.  I believe if we do not do something about formulating a treatment path for drug addiction we are headed for a wave of crime that will consume law enforcement and detention resources at a pace we won't be able to keep up with. If we do not do something NOW to stave off that certainty our jails prisons mental hospitals halfway houses and courts will be even more overwhelmed than they are now and a knee jerk reaction (such as early and mass releases) will undo the reason these people were incarcerated to begin with. Proactive in-patient family and faith supported drug treatment sooner rather than later.  I believe Anderson County has the people and the assets to powerfully pursue any path it chooses. Now it just needs the leadership that can ask the hard questions and has the vision to take us there.  We should not waste money on a new jail. Refurbish the old jail and take the saving to build a county prison farm. We need to become self sufficient in building roads and bridges. We need to reduce crime by confronting our drug problem by locking up repeat petty criminals (for up to a year) we help them to get their lives back on track.  Are you a frustrated Democrat in Anderson County District 4?  If you are a Democrat and are frustrated with your Democratic Party's lack of participation in District 4 I encourage you to read my platform and see that I am a man of the people and will serve all the citizens of this District equally. Let's unite to defeat our foes. Wherever they may be. All of you who want to have a voice in Anderson County. Come one come all!  Vote for me Frank Pressly in the June 12th primary (it's an open primary anyone can vote -Republican or Democrat) for Anderson County Council District 4 and take one friend with you to the polls. Thanks  Please SHARE this with those you care about. I do not have a lot of money for signs and expensive advertising; but the same penny saving methods I conduct this campaign are the same tight fist I will treat your tax dollar.",political,Facebook
In this post I will address the second of the five planks in my platform for re-election to the Board of Supervisors in Allegheny Township: MINIMAL GOVERNMENT INTRUSION INTO OUR DAILY LIVES!  Onerous government ordinances were the reason I first ran for election in 1999. The open fence rule was the one that really pushed me to run. The township ordinance required 45% open space in every fence and the fence was only permitted to be three feet high. The result was absolutely no privacy fence: no shield from automobile lights or noise and no privacy fence around swimming pools and no private back yard. If a citizen was sited for an illegal fence the fine was up to $300 per day until the fence was corrected. One of my first actions was to repeal the open fence rule. Now you may build any kind of fence you want any height and it needs no open spaces! We also had a rule that forbade any structure on a tract of undeveloped property unless a house was built first. That rule was modified to allow any structure that is less than 1000 square feet. As for zoning infractions under my watch the zoning officer will not go around the township looking for opportunities to site citizens for minor infractions but if the the infraction is egregious or if he receives a complaint he will enforce our property codes. The supervisors are elected to provide public safety and transportation and to enact ordinances that will make our community a good place to live and conduct business. I will never vote for an ordinance that interferes with our right to freedom.  Kathryn Starr,political,Facebook
Shannon was a typical kid. She liked watching TV climbing trees running around her neighborhood. She had long hair and long arms as she was growing into a tween. She went to church. Her family was in law enforcement in her town. And as she was growing into her 12-year-old body she was being raped by a relative.  She became pregnant at 12 years old. She didn't know it until well after she missed her period. Unlike most kids her age she knew it came every 32 days. When it didn't come she thought maybe this month was a little different. More days passed. She started feeling sick she started vomiting. She thought about one of her favorite shows - Full House - and went to the store to get a pregnancy test. She felt embarrassed so she said she was picking up a test for her mom. She went into some woods climbed a tree and tested herself alone. She was pregnant with her rapist's child.  In America at least 20% of young girls are sexually assaulted 75% of them by a relative. Of those girls who are sexually assaulted by family members well over 60% are raped.  States throughout our country - including Missouri - are pushing laws to force 12-year-old girls like Shannon to carry their rapists' children no matter the mental impact it will forever have on the children forced into 9 months of pregnancy after being raped. Not only babies having babies but babies forced to have babies by their rapists and their government.  Children are more likely to suffer physical consequences from their pregnancies. They're more likely to have complicated pregnancies to suffer from severe depression to die during the process.  In 1973 when the Supreme Court ruled that women have a right to get abortions the Court didn't say that abortions were good or bad. They said that they are a right we have to be free from the regulation of the state that the government should not impose its view or its restrictions on women at a moment when only the pregnant woman can truly understand what she is going through.  The Supreme Court did not stop the states from making their communities better for women and children and making sure that all pregnant women were served well in America. It said the conversation a woman has with her doctor is none of the state's business.  When abortion was illegal women still had them because the reasons to have them - nonviable pregnancies substantial risks to health inability to afford a child unsupportive partners and families rape - were ever-present. And as we ban the practice in America again those reasons still exist.  If this was about helping women or babies we would be passing legislation to ensure expectant mothers have all the resources they could ever need. We would make sure women had excellent pre-natal and mental health care. We would form supportive community groups that provided accurate medical information to women. We would make it easy for women to make the right choice for them in America.  But this isn't about women or babies. America has one of the worst infant mortality rates among wealthy countries. Missouri's rate is even worse than our already terrible national average. And despite bills being proposed to support pregnant mothers those aren't being passed. Those bills don't get the televised support of the governor like this forced-pregnancy bill has gotten.  Instead of making pregnancy safer our government has decided to require it. It's not about making people safer. It's not about addressing the reasons why abortions happen. It's not about understanding that without access to health care many women will die. It's not about the wellbeing of 12-year-olds like Shannon. It's about control. It's about a government with the power to make even the most private decisions for women. It's about having a male-dominated government that includes very few legislators with medical expertise tell women and their doctors that the government knows best.  This Missouri forced-pregnancy law is unconstitutional. It breaches the separation of church and state - it includes religious tenets in the actual bill - and it violates our right to privacy and to be free from government regulation in making such important medical decisions. It will cost the state a lot of money to litigate and defend the law despite its unconstitutionality. The Attorney General's Office should be providing litigation cost estimates for bills like this one that are glaringly unconstitutional for the public to see. Instead of putting that money into making our state a better home for mothers and children we're going to waste it on lawyers.  That's because this isn't about protecting anyone. It's about control. Missouri will not be a better place because women and children are forced by their government into pregnancy. That's not pro-life. That's pro-cruelty. If pro-life is what you want I'd humbly recommend we make sure our mothers stop dying in our hospitals we don't force 12-year-olds into pregnancy and we quit telling women and their doctors we know better.,political,Facebook
I swore an oath of office to protect and defend the entire Constitution including all ten amendments of the Bill of Rights.  That's why during my time in the Maine Senate I sponsored and passed Constitutional Carry to restore our 2nd Amendment rights as Maine people.  That's also why seeing Washington D.C. bureaucrats and politicians erode our fundamental right to privacy I sponsored the 4th Amendment Protection Act to reign them in.  Our current Congressman Jared Golden does not share my commitment to our constitutional freedoms.  When he was in the Maine House of Representatives he voted three times to disarm Maine people by opposing Constitutional Carry.  Today Jared Golden took his attack on our Bill of Rights a step further by voting to renew the PATRIOT Act empowering Washington DC bureaucrats to access our digital records without a warrant from a judge.  There are enough politicians in Washington trampling our Constitutional freedoms --- we deserve better!  Can I count on your support to win this campaign for Congress to Free Maine and Free America?

Special Election Derangement Syndrome By Jeff Scott  District 9 voters in the Special Election for Congress on September 10 will be surprised to find 4 candidates. The Republican and Democratic campaigns pretend no other candidates exist. They tell their loyal team players that Libertarians and Greens are stealing votes that belong to the major parties.  It's human nature to want to support a candidate on a team that has a good chance of winning. But party loyalty has gone far beyond simply rallying for a cause. In July indictments were issued for 7 people an ongoing reminder to voters of the Republican election fraud of 2018. Instead of humility the major parties project their entitlement more than ever squealing like babies about third parties.  Remember in November 2018 that there were only 900 votes separating the major candidates. If there had been a wider spread say 2000 or more the election fraud might never have come to light. Since I received over 5000 votes both parties hold a special grudge against the Libertarian voters that did not play for their team. Im proud of spoiling their entitlement but now I am reaping the harsh blowback.  The campaigners and supporters of the major parties suffer election derangement syndrome by acting as if it's perfectly natural for them to abandon basic human decency. They project bitter hatred especially in social media to anyone who doesn't support their candidate. This is not accidental. Both parties hire professional staff to implement this plan.  Major party candidates never debated for voters. The Democratic party candidate has no legislative experience no public record of his views and wont appear in public in an adversarial setting. He expects voters to view him as lawmaker based on no evidence at all. He wont argue about important issues at all while his campaign team communicates that 3rd party voters siphon off the support he truly deserves.  Voters are frustrated with bullying parties. They know that big spending on corporate media is meant to render other candidates invisible. They deeply resent that they are told to suck up their complaints and take one for the team. Hold your nose pick the lesser evil.  Traditional grassroots voter-information groups such as the League of Women Voters no longer sponsor debates. Independent voter groups used to be run by volunteers who offered their facilities to qualified candidates. Their historical mission is over and fair competition is a thing of the past.  The rise of extremely manipulative social media by the tech giants and major news outlets has changed campaigns. National parties have mastered the art of mobilization and fear-mongering. Information about you is gathered to predict your vote. The more they know the easier it is to forecast what you will do and easier for them to protect their two-party monopoly.  Voters send hate messages calling me a spoiler a thief and worse because of their fear that the other team might gain ground. Third party candidates experience this hatred everyday. I understand voter loyalty up to a point but I dont understand why they are encouraged to abandon civility for the higher cause of power.  I have moderate pro-American positions by any reasonable standard. The major party candidates would have benefited from engaging with me.  I believe Trump could accomplish something positive.  The Squad of four progressives are introducing neglected ideas about national security.  Our debates on immigration should never abandon considerations of international economic harmony cultural exchange and humanitarian borders.  Peace is the only way our world will survive. America cannot be both a beacon of freedom and a bully in a state of permanent war. Violence cannot continue.  We cant print and borrow money to create prosperity. Federal corruption has never been more flagrant.  The American public is surveilled manipulated and propagandized. Our privacy might never return.  Do these views shock Democratic and Republican voters?  Dear voter I am asking you to be unpredictable. Your only power is your vote and that vote is only powerful when you stray from the team that thinks it owns you.  They depend on you to abandon independence and dignity.  They want you to suffer election derangement syndrome.,political,Facebook
Freedoms - Basic Freedoms Ordained By God - 11 30 2017 - Revised 03 19 2020  1. Freedom to communicate or not communicate.  2. Freedom to worship and assemble how we want as long as we are not unjustly hurting others.  3. Freedom to defend ourselves and others from unlawful and harmful acts using current means.  4. Freedom from unlawful search and seizure and the right to privacy.  5. Freedom from toxic substances and evil influences (drugs and the medical cartel).  6. Freedom to have natural and healthy food as God has created it (fruits vegetables and meats).  7. Freedom to have a fair trial and to have fair and just laws in the land that people are held accountable by.  8. Freedom to be productive from overtaxation to work hard at a God-given purpose and to get what we need in exchange to live and sustain ourselves.  9. Freedom to create our own kind the choice to procreate.  The problem is many lands dont have these freedoms and because of corrupt influences in the society there are very few places which have these freedoms across the board.  These freedoms have to be earned by the people in the lands that they are from.  We relentlessly pursue these freedoms for all people.  We will not stop or be satisfied until people have these basic freedoms.  And we do whatever we can to help educate and facilitate all people earning these freedoms.

The explanation below is what I would like to share but unlike the City Manager I had my initial statement reviewed by the City Attorney to ensure compliance with personnel privacy legal considerations. My statement below has been approved as to its legal compliance.  I have asked the City Attorney to review the City Managers public statement for compliance with the same standard I am complying with.  My statement:  Several people have asked why I was out-of-town when the Mayor had called a special session on Tuesday June 12 2015 to discuss Council appointees performance. My answer is as follows:  1. Prior to the Tuesday June 5 2018 Council meeting I published my 1 December 2017 e-mail to the City Manager Dave Hansen in advance of an Executive Session regarding the pier project and the CMs email reply all of which the CM shared with Bruce Thompson. I publicly stated that in my judgment Mr. Hansens sharing of my email with Bruce Thompson was sufficient cause for his dismissal.  2. Tuesday June 5 2018 in the appropriate Council forum I made my case and recommendation.  3. Friday June 8 2015 my Council packet was delivered at approximately 5 pm this being my first notification of a City Council special meeting for a closed session a notification too late to adjust my business travel.  4. Sunday June 9 2018 I transmitted a letter to the City Clerk for my stationary and auto pen to my peers.  5. Since my position was well known the absence of my participation on Tuesday June 12 2018 was seemingly of no material consequence.  7. I learned from a Council member after the special session June 12 2018 that they were called by the Vice Mayor on June 6 2018 that Council was going to re-discuss the meeting of June 5 2018. Needless to say I did not get a similar call.  8. Council as a body was fully informed of my position and reasoning. The timeline only provides insights as to the reason for my absence at the June 12 2018 Special Meeting executive session.  9. I stand by my judgment that the CMs sharing of my email with Bruce Thompson on a matter in which Bruce Thompson was at least an indirect financially interested party in a procurement decision being discussed by City Council warranted the CMs dismissal.  10. I stand by my position that the voters should elect a new City Council majority willing to hire a new City Manager.  When I receive a subsequent legal opinion on the additional legal latitude I may have as a consequence of the City Managers public statement I may be able to offer a deconstruction of his explanation.  In the interim I trust the voters to look at the facts and draw the appropriate conclusion about the CMs explanation of his actions.  I look forward to additional emails that certainly will come forward and the pattern speaks for itself.,political,Facebook
