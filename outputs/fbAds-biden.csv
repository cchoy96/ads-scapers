"The state of this world is getting scary. It's unfortunate that many do not see it.  Millions are marching around the world in protest every weekend against COVID-19 lockdowns vaccine mandates and the removal of civil rights liberties and freedoms. With at least a hundred thousand protesting in cities and towns around Australia.  ""If you forget the past you are doomed to repeat it."" ""I don't agree with what you say but I'll give my life defending your right to say it.""  Two very important statements the kids of today are not being taught. Free speech is something the whole world needs. Even racist hatred and down right evil things need to be allowed to be said. Gives us the opportunity to hit back through words NOT violence.  Let's start with Covid-19:  The fear being pushed by politicians and the media about COVID-19 is out of control. No I am not one of those that think COVID-19 is a hoax. COVID-19 is real. As I read once: Do I believe that people are getting sick? Yes. Do I believe that people are dying? Yes. Do I believe some hospitals are overrun? Yes. Do I believe nurses and healthcare workers are terrified? Yes. Do I believe China is lying about it's numbers? Yes. Do I believe COVID-19 was made in a lab? Yes. Do I believe China is responsible? Yes. Do I believe COVID-19 is being politicized? Yes. Do I believe COVID-19 is being used to strip Americans and Australians of their rights? Yes. Do I believe there's a bigger picture than what politicians and the media are telling us? Yes. Do I believe this is more about power and control than anything else? Yes. Do I believe we as Australians just set a dangerous precedent for our freedoms? Yes... and I am much more terrified of that than any virus.  Am I an anti-vaxxer? No I am 100% for vaccines. Myself and my family are all vaccinated for everything except for the COVID-19 vaccine. No I do not plan to get the COVID-19 Vaccine. I will not inject a vaccine into my body that is being forced upon me. Especially a vaccine that was ready in less than a year. It takes at least 5 years to fully test a vaccine. We do NOT know the long term side effects yet. I am Anti-MANDATORY vaccine I am not Anti-Vaccine. Take the vaccine if you want I support you decision to take it. But don't force it on me.  I do not believe in lockdowns or mask mandates. We lived with Influenza (a virus that had a confirmed 0.13% death rate for the years 2016-2017) for generations without mask mandates or lockdowns. I used 2016-2017 because they are the latest years where the numbers are confirmed: COVID-19 is far more deadly for over 60's than Influenza particularly those with underlying conditions with a death rate of about 0.66%. However When you account for elderly patients dying to COVID-19 without an underlying condition that death rate drops to 0.2%. Compared to the 0.08% Death rate for under 60's with COVID-19 dropping further the younger the bracket. The Delta variant is less deadly but more contagious. Please note I am talking about the death rate (Your chance to die if you get infected) not number of deaths. These numbers are based from the CDC's own words that 90% of COVID-19 cases will go completely undetected as most of the population is asymptomatic to the COVID-19 Virus. All this information can be found on the CDC website.  Now while the death rate is higher than influenza in the older generation. This is no reason to completely shut down a country even at the high end of 0.66%. No one wants to even talk about the rising rate of ""Self harm"" especially in teenagers due to lockdowns. These lockdowns are causing far more damage than they are preventing Not just in ""self harm"" rates. Source:  Next Abortion:  Abortion is getting out of control. The latest data from Planned Parenthood states that over 98%... YES OVER 98% of the reasons given for Abortion is ""Unwanted Baby"". Less than 2% is due to Rape / Incest. 2 reasons that are the only time I ever agree with Abortion and ONLY before a heartbeat. Source:  Both men and women need to take some responsibility for your own actions. If you cannot afford / want to bring a baby into the world then Wrap it Swallow it Flush it Throw it or just say no. But please STOP using Abortion as a contraceptive. Stop killing babies because you couldn't keep your pants zipped up. I accept that accidents happen but that's the risk you take when you say yes. Deal with the consequences of your actions.  And now for the US itself:  The US is being run by a senile dementia ridden old fart controlled by special interest groups in the hopes of turning America into a communist dictatorship. The Left leaning Mainstream Media is complicit in this they regularly distort the truth to push their own agenda. Notice they are not reporting on the Phone call between President Biden and the Afghan President Ashraf Ghani. A phone call that if it happened under President Trump He would be rightfully impeached before the media could even report on it.  In this phone call President Biden's own words pressured President Ghani to distort the truth: President Biden to President Ghani: ""And theres a need whether it is true or not there is a need to project a different picture."" Source:  This is not the first time President Biden has pressured another country to help him politically: Then Vice-President Biden with President Obama's backing threatened to withhold aid money if a prosecutor that was investigating the company Hunter Biden was working at was not fired. Source from then Vice-President Biden's own lips:   There are multiple other examples of corruption lies and propaganda by the Biden administration and it's buddies in the media. However this post will become a novel if I continue. Follow me for more examples in future posts.  And finally Australia:  Australia itself is sliding down a dark path. Our country is done as we know it if the population doesn't wake up and soon.  Queensland is opening a concentration camp in the center of the state. Source:  Victoria is the next communist China puppet state. Led by a known Communist supporter. Source: Multiple other articles showing the corruption of Daniel Andrews.  The Federal Government just passed a spy bill. Allowing them to access our phones and upload or delete data at will. Source:  The media around the world doesn't even care that Australia has begun a process to strip its citizens of what little rights we had. I fear that most Australians have forgotten what happened 80 years ago. We don't even have the means to defend ourselves any more they are scared another Eureka Stockade will happen.  It is time for Australians to take a stand. It is time for us to take our country back but we need help. We need the world to care about what is currently taking place in Australia.  Australia must ditch the crown. We must become a Constitutional Federal Republic. We do not have a Bill of Rights that needs to change. We deserve our freedom. But we must earn it first.

I just voted NO on the Democrats Infrastructure legislation.  Our nation is in desperate need of infrastructure reform and investment but this bill is not the way to do it. Democrats have made it abundantly clear that this legislation is simply a trojan horse for President Bidens radical Build Back Better agenda and paves the way for a laundry list of socialist policies.  Out of the total $1.2 trillion of spending in this package only $110 billion is directed towards roads bridges and other real infrastructure projects that our communities need.  Most importantly the pay-fors in this bill come up short. Over $400 billion of the $1.2 trillion price tag is unpaid for adding to our skyrocketing national debt and once again forcing hardworking Kansans to pick up the tab.,political,Facebook

Im sorry your Commander in Chief let you down. Your efforts deserved a more dignified end.  Second: Whether or not we belonged in Afghanistan is a different discussion but the fact is - we were there. As such there was a right way and a wrong way to exit and President Biden you chose the wrong way. You placed our military and civilians in great danger. You left our Afghan allies to be slaughtered. You ensured their women would lose what few rights they had. You left our own weaponry behind to be used against us. You allowed thousands of imprisoned terrorists back out onto the streets.  My formal education is in the international relations arena so my mind automatically goes to the domino effect you have created.

As Texas Attorney General I will fight with every legal avenue available to stop the Biden administration from rolling back laws and policies that were working and effectively stemming illegal immigration.  Part of the solution to the border crisis is for Texas and other freedom-loving red states to bring the battles to the courtroom - and win. Every time the Biden Administration does something unconstitutional a multi-state coalition of myself and other hard-charging State Attorneys General will be there to push back against Bidens devastating border policies. Illegal immigration undermines the rule of law creates chaos at the border wreaks havoc with the lives of those migrating to our border under false hopes and is an insult to the immigrants who comply with our laws to gain entry and achieve citizenship.

President Joe Biden and the Democrats are committed to pushing their multi-trillion dollar boondoggle upon the American people. But this plan doesnt just come with an expensive price tag  it is filled with radical ideas that will weaken our economy and reorder America as we know it.  To be clear this package:  Forces $2.1 trillion in tax increases on American families and job creators  Imposes Green New Deal polices and destroys American Energy Independence  Allows over $10 billion in federal funding to go toward abortions  Weaponizes the IRS by allowing for monitoring and tracking of almost every single bank transaction made  Provides amnesty to millions and millions of illegal immigrants  Leaves rural America behind by failing to allocate any funds for critical programs like broadband the commodity safety net crop insurance and disaster assistance  This radical spending package is nothing more than a Trojan Horse for the Democrats to force their extreme socialist agenda on the American people.  And the American people are already seeing and experiencing the negative consequences of their failed policies  rising prices Open Borders labor shortages.  It is time to bring back the smart commonsense Republican policies that created a prosperous America with economic growth record unemployment and border security.  Americas future is at risk and we must do everything we can to flight these Far-Left Socialist policies that will only set our country back.  I will do everything in my power to stand against these radical ideas and fight for conservative values and principles like limited government free enterprise and Peace Through Strength that have made our country great.,political,Facebook
"Have you noticed the absence of the obnoxious journalists & reporters since Biden got elected ? I am talking of the bought and paid for democrat operatives acting as news people like Jim Acosta & Jake Tapper & Brian Stelter & the Cuomo boy..........Chris Cuomo  just to name a few. They are absent because they know that everyone knows they are fake journalists. Questioning Biden like they questioned President Trump or rather harassed him with lies and misrepresentations would be too revealing of Biden and his spokespersons & their incompetence and lies & ineptness.They would make Jen Psaki look like the nut she is & the whole Biden administration would be exposed. They would lose favor & perhaps their jobs if they crossed who holds their leash. The democrats have such plants as fake journalists in all of the MSM including the NY Times and WAPO. They also control and dictate to their giant social media servants.These organizations are an arm of the corrupt democrat party. With Trump they were eager to create false scandals and crises but with Biden they cover up his major blunders and incompetence.Just take a look at the Afghanistan debacle and mess. look at the border crisis the inflation and the Covid mess. Look at the prices of food and gas. Look at the constant lies & all the other disasters in about 7 months ! If any of this was under Trump I think he would have been crucified and I mean literally crucified. They have no shame or honor to do a job well done with honesty and integrity. They have become perverted by the democrats & are a major part of the corruption. Once the media was the watchdogs over the politicians but now they are the lapdogs of the democrat party. The few mentioned above are just a few of many more fake journalist in MSNBC ABC NBC CBS  CNN LA Times NY times & WAPO and much more including FOX. I cannot forget to mention the stellar Rachel Maddow and Don Lemon & cute blinking eyes Anderson Cooper. There are too many more to mention but they are obvious to anyone who watches the media ! One of the greatest competent men to become president Donald Trump was trashed and demonized endlessly and a real corrupt demon Joe Biden has been lionized & made into a hero despite almost 50 years of constant failures & lies and deception. With the help of the fake & dishonest journalists and fake media & the corrupt democrat machinery & soulless activists Joe Biden was supposedly the winner of the Presidential elections.

"Too important not to read and share.  STAND UP AND BE PROUD A MUCH BETTER STRATEGY  Rabbi Yakov Saacks The Chai Center Dix Hills NY  The following thoughts are not meant to belittle or besmirch anyone.  There has been a fascinating conversation going on all in response to President Bidens pick of Aaron Keyak to oversee Jewish outreach on behalf of the White House.  Mr. Keyak has an impressive resume. He was the former head of the National Jewish Democratic Council as well as serving on the Biden campaigns finance committee. In addition he had stints as communications director for Democratic representatives Jerrold Nadler of New York and Steve Rothman of New Jersey. Mr. Keyak also helped lead a Jewish outreach team known as the Hub that backed President Barack Obamas 2012 reelection bid. The group claimed partial credit for Obamas victory in Florida where it led major outreach efforts.  Mr. Keyak came out with not one but with two tweets that sparked furor dissent and uproar. I am diametrically opposed to those who agreed with him and his message. Please be assured I do not think he is a bad person. I completely disagree with his message even though I am sure that he thinks that he meant well.  I do feel though that he being a representative of the administration should think 100 times before he speaks or in this case tweets.  FIRST TWEET - CLEAR Mr. Keyak tweets It pains me to say this but if you fear for your life or physical safety take off your kippah and hide your Magen David (Star of David). (Obviously if you can ask your rabbi first.)  SECOND TWEET  LESS CLEAR Its important that those who wear kippot dont feel more pressure to put our lives in unnecessary actual danger  especially when actions are attempting to be grounded in halacha. (Jewish law). Given the rise in Jew hatred and anti-Semitic attacks we must stand with all Jews.""  Both these tweets by Mr. Keyak suggest that due to the rise of anti-Semitism Jews should be savvier about how they display their Jewishness. In his first tweet he recommends asking your Rabbi if you can but in the second tweet he actually becomes the Rabbi.  PROBLEM # 1  IT DOES NOT WORK. Telling a Jew to hide their Jewishness has never worked. It did not work during the Spanish Inquisition nor was it effective during the Holocaust. The haters will seek you out by hook or by crook.  One of the best books that I have ever read titled The Pity of it All written by Amos Elon traces the history of German Jews from 17431933. One of the central themes of the book focuses on the constant efforts of the German Jews to assimilate and become an integral part of their host country. As we now know this journey ends with the tragic outcome of the virtual annihilation of the German Jews during the Holocaust.  Mr. Keyak we have tried your approach in the past. It has proven to be a colossal failure.  PROBLEM # 2 - NAIVETE There have always been collaborators who will out the Jew when the time is opportune. The Jew can look like a Presbyterian minister or a Buddhist monk; Hitler had his way of weeding out the Jews from wherever they were. To suggest that one hide ones Jewishness is to not understand how anti-Semitism works and is an incredible display of naivet on Mr. Keyaks part.  PROBLEM # 3 - OPENLY VISIBLE JEWS Ok Mr. Keyak lets say I am a Chassidic Jew with long side locks and an even longer beard and even longer black coat. I follow your advice and take off my kippah what does this accomplish? Seriously Mr. Keyak what do you advise the ultra-Orthodox Jew to do to hide their very apparent Jewishness. Can I suggest an earring or two so this way they look more like hipsters? Or is your advice only for the clean-shaven with single-breasted suits?  I remember walking on Duval Street in Key West where I was dressed completely incognito. I had a brightly colored t-shirt baseball cap on backwards and casual pants on with my fringes tucked in. Within five minutes I was stopped three times with people asking me about Kosher food and what times are the afternoon services. Mr. Keyak you can try to hide but you cannot run.  PROBLEM # 4  IS THIS REALLY THE ANSWER I do not think Aaron Keyak meant to hurt anyone by writing what he wrote. In fact he said that it pains him to write this. However it was a very painful tweet and completely uncalled for.  Is this really what we should be doing? Hiding our kippahs and tucking in our Jewish stars? What comes next detach the mezuzahs from our homes and remove the obviously Jewish bumper stickers from our cars? Should we now stop going food shopping in the Kosher aisle at the supermarket and just order kosher products online? Do I look into surgery to grow my foreskin back when I go swimming and need to change in a public locker room?  Where does this stop?  I wonder if the Asian outreach liaison tweeted that Asians should wear dark glasses that cover their nationality. Did the Muslim outreach liaison post 9/11 tweets that burkas abayas and hijabs should be suspended and exchanged for pink sweatshirts and orange jeans?  Mr. Keyak I know you meant well. However you are a public official and you need to really ruminate in your mind whether this is the right thing or not. You are no longer just a private congregant in a synagogue espousing your views. You are a public figure who in my opinion stepped in it.  PROBLEM # 5 CANCEL CULTURE We have all heard of cancel culture which is not pretty. As Winston Churchill said in 1948 during a speech in the House of Commons Those who fail to learn from history are condemned to repeat it. We must learn from history and not just try to stamp it out.  Telling Jews to rid themselves of obvious markings is akin to cancel culture. Lets pretend Jews dont exist and if they do they are not relevant and not only are they not relevant they are in hiding. A Jew in hiding is part of our history that no one wants to go back to. In fact Mr. Keyak we made a promise of Never Again. I believe that Never Again means that never again will we be marginalized and be willing victims and scapegoats.  On the contrary we are the victors. Mr. Keyak you a Jew hold a position at the White House on behest of the President of the United States. I dont see Himmlers grandkids in the White House nor do I see Goring Hess Mengele or Eichmans. I dont see Stalins kids lighting the Menorah in the Kremlin do you.  PROBLEM # 6 ROLE OF GOVERNMENT This is not the role of Government. Your particular role is to make sure that we Jews have a voice and are understood. The Governments role is to protect all its citizens from harm. The very first amendment deals with freedom of religion and the right we have to practice -- how when and where we want.  Mr. Keyak are you suggesting that the Government can no longer protect us in pursuing these rights?  BE PROUD Mr. Keyak raise your head up high. Put the kippah back on eat some kugel flaunt the Star of David necklace and invite the President to your sons bris.  This is true of everyone who reads this. Be it Jew or gentile regardless of race religion or creed. You have nothing to be ashamed of. You have nothing to hide tuck or remove. It is your/our inalienable right.

"""The Psychology of Trump-Haters""  Whats happening in America right now shouldnt come as a surprise to anyone. It could be spotted from miles away!  As a psychologist watching the political back and forth in the USA over the past 5 years is pretty incredible. Seeing people say what theyve said behaved in the way theyve behaved and made the decisions theyve made has been interesting to watch. Its also illuminated a very clear truth.  The reason why Trump-haters hate Trump so much is not because they actually hate Trump the person. Because they dont even know him. Theyre definitely not protesting Trumps competence or political policies. Because well lets face it he did an incredible job with our economy protected the people inside the country with strong borders and won the respect of so many around the world. Allies felt supported. Enemies knew not to mess. Prospects knew to tread carefully. And he did it all so confidently unabashedly unapologetically. How attractive!  So the question remains if its not his personality and its not his policies what is it? Notice that people who have been critical of Trump tend to be very reactionary in their position. Its a highly emotional topic for them. It stirs up a lot. Interestingly the reaction has been so powerful and pervasive that it even has its own syndrome!  And therein lies the answer to this question. The people who have been so vehemently opposed to Trump are not really against Trump. Theyre upset at what Trump triggers deep inside them. That is what they're reacting to when they hear ""Trump."" Trump reminds many of the unprocessed anger they have towards authority figures in their lives. Maybe an angry father. Perhaps a controlling mother. Possibly an abusive boss. For many people the idea of Trump has woken (no pun intended) up tremendous emotional pain and psychological trauma that these people have not dealt with. And that they have not wanted to deal with.  Psychologically-speaking thats how we got here. Thats why so many picked Biden. I put it in quotes because they didnt really pick Biden. They just wanted to escape Trump. Or I should say the painful memories that Trump stirred up inside them. Was Trump opinionated? Of course he was. Was he outlandish in his delivery at times? Absolutely. Did he come across as arrogant and egotistical at points? Without question. Its all true!!!  But objectively that is what you want in a President of the USA. That is what you want from your Commander in Chief. That is what you want from the guy whos sole responsibility and duty is to go up to bat for you. You want someone who will unabashedly stand up for you guard you and protect your interests with everything hes got when it comes down to the wire.  The truth is to guard and protect properly sometimes you have to be bold. You have be direct. You have to be aggressive. Otherwise some wont hear you. They will not respect you. They will manipulate you. And they will walk all over you.  To the Trump haters I feel for you. Living this way must be complete emotional hell. Because youre always on the run. Your life is driven by fear. You make decisions that are based in anxiety and avoidance. Youre constantly looking to make choices not that you necessarily personally believe in but because they are less triggering. And unfortunately sometimes it leads to this. The truth about Biden is clear to everyone now. At least it should be. He was never fit to be a leader in this capacity. The writing was on the wall from the very beginning. Some decided to see it. Others were too scared to. Because it stirred up too much. Its okay. You didnt know.  Hopefully this incident can be used as an opportunity for you to exercise the courage to look inside and see what your triggers in life actually are. Consider. Who talked down to you growing up? Who hurt you? Who made you feel so little ? Pay attention to it. Process it. Address it.  You will see better. Decide better. And live better.",political,Facebook

The horrific attack in Kabul that killed 13 U.S. service members devastated every patriotic American. My prayers go out to families and loved ones of these American Heroes.  This is a heartbreaking time for our country. As Commander-In-Chief The Presidents responsibility is to safely evacuate every American citizen from Afghanistan and keep our troops away from unnecessary risk.  My casework staff is working around-the-clock to help during this crisis. We are working with many families to process requests from families seeking assistance with evacuation. If you or someone you know is trying to get out of Afghanistan please contact my office. We will provide all assistance possible and keep you apprised of the most up-to-date information during this rapidly changing situation.  s self-imposed deadline of August 31st to withdraw from Afghanistan should be amended until all U.S. citizens are evacuated. Tragically it is clear that the President has no concrete answers or plan to rescue the American people or allies who are still stranded in Afghanistan.  This botched withdrawal from Afghanistan is the most colossal military and foreign policy failure since President Carters mishandling of Iran.  President Biden is responsible for the incompetent decision-making that has needlessly killed U.S. troops placed American citizens in harms way gifted $87 billion of sophisticated U.S. military equipment to the Taliban and destroyed U.S. prestige. Americas allies no longer trust us and our adversaries no longer fear our nation.  It didnt have to be this way and the situation has become a catastrophic failure.

"What a disgraceThe Secretary of State Antony Blinken invited UN officials to come and comment & investigate contemporary forms of racism in America ! Just when you think it cannot get any lower or stupider it does. The UN !! which is full of corrupt countries & corrupt officials. There are all sorts of atrocities happening all around the world with torture & murder & genocide & The US Secretary of State is asking for them to come & investigate contemporary racism in the US. Then recently the Chairman of the joint chiefs of staff was giving a lecture on Critical Race Theory maybe even White supremacy ! Cubans and Haitians fleeing by boat from total oppression & chaos were warned against traveling to US by non other than Mayorkas Head of Homeland Security. He said no refuge for you refugees ! What happened to the humane treatment & compassion for asylum seekers & refugees all of a sudden ? I'll tell you the difference they just want refugees who they think will vote for them. If we think that you will vote for the fascist socialist democrat party we will let you flood the borders with or without testing for Corona checking gang memberships or any background check. Just come in ! We will silently bus you inside our country. They do not give a damn about human rights & the plight of the oppressed. The Cuban government is killing its own people & if there ever was a need to give asylum & refuge to any people right now it is the Cubans trying to flee Cuba. But not Biden the clown in chief & his administration or his VP & cabinet members. They are worried about non existent ""White Supremacy Terrorism"" attacks !

RELIGIOUS EXEMPTION TO COVID-19 VACCINE MANDATE  Not a day goes by that I do not receive an inquiry regarding the religious exemption to the C-19 vaccine mandate. Religious exemption claims to the C-19 vaccine mandate are increasing in workplaces across the nation. Employers and employees are not clear on the process for making a claim or processing one. Employees are experiencing concern and pressure. Courts around the nation are starting to weigh in on the issue. Here is a summary of related and notable events I have compiled on the topic that may be helpful to you:  - In 1905 and 1922 SCOTUS upheld the right to impose vaccination requirements on the general public. (Jacobson v. Massachusetts (1905); Zucht v. King (1922)). However neither of these cases addressed religious exemption.  - 12/21/2020  Vatican announced C-19 vaccine is morally acceptable.  - 09/09/2021  President Biden issues Executive Order requiring C-19 vaccination for most federal employees and federal contractors. The EO allows federal employees to claim medical and religious exemptions.  The right to request a religious exemption stems from Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Sincerely Held Religious Belief: EEOC guidance provides that employers should accept an employees claim of a sincerely held religious belief unless the employer has an objective basis to deny the exemption.  Reasonable Accommodation: The EEOC states employers must provide reasonable accommodations for workers who have sincerely held religious beliefs unless doing so poses an undue hardship. The EEOCs guidance provides that accommodating a religious belief may be an undue hardship if it compromises workplace safety. Employers are encouraged to engage in the interactive process for determining reasonable accommodation.  - 09/16/2021  The Safer Federal Workforce Task Force issued guidance regarding exemptions stating an agency may be required to provide reasonable accommodation to employees who claim exemption based upon a sincerely held religious belief.  - 08/2021  United Airlines becomes the first U.S. carrier to require C-19 vaccinations for all domestic employees. United planned to put employees who received religious exemptions on temporary unpaid personal leave starting Oct. 2. As a result of at least 2 lawsuits against United those plans have been put on hold.  - 08/12/2021  SCOTUS denied review of a challenge from a group of Indiana Univ. students against Indiana Univ.s vaccine requirement. Indiana Univ.s vaccine mandate allows for a religious exemption.  - 08/23/2021  FDA granted full approval to the Pfizer C-19 vaccine.  - 08/27/2021  Harris and Cluett v. University of Massachusetts - Massachusetts court upheld UMasss denial of a Catholic students religious exemption claim stating the Catholic Church declared the vaccine to be morally justified and noting that the student had received other vaccinations as a prerequisite to attending school.  - 09/09/2021  President Biden announces the Path out of the Pandemic initiative which will extend the vaccine mandate to the private sector.  - 09/15/2021  Pope Francis encouraged the public to take the vaccine stating he and almost everyone in the Vatican is vaccinated.  - 09/30/2021  Federal Appeals Court ruled that New York must grant temporary exemptions to unvaccinated health care workers claiming religious exemption.  - Does HIPPA prohibit an employer from requiring an employee to disclose whether the employee has received the C-19 vaccine?  No. Generally HIPPA laws only apply to HIPPA covered entities such as: health care providers health plans and health care clearinghouses.,political,Facebook

For Immediate Release: Our Response To President Bidens Visit to Idaho.  Mr. President We hope you enjoyed your time in Idaho this week. It must be a good feeling to get out of Washington DC. Unfortunately we were not able to connect while you were here. If we had been able to meet there are a few topics we would have discussed:  As with all things in life there are areas you can directly control those you influence and others you have no control over. As President there are clear boundaries about what you can control. As the 10th amendment says you can only do what is explicitly called out in the Constitution. Everything else must be done by influence. The Legislative branch has the ability to create laws but you do not. EVERYTHING else is owned by the states or individuals.  Over the past nine months of your presidency you have consistently overstepped your authority with states rights. Here in Idaho we believe in self-reliance and independence. Idahoans know what is best for Idaho - not you.  In addition the policies you have enacted are negatively impacting the next generation of Americans that we represent:  - Most small businesses are owned by the under 40 group. Increased regulation tax increases and mandates are suffocating small businesses. Thousands have closed their doors.  - Inconsistencies in your COVID communication is causing confusion and mistrust. Decisions on schools impact our children. Parents are trying to juggle careers with potentially having to stay home due to closures. Vaccine mandates risk the jobs for many young professionals. The federal government has no place in requiring private citizens or businesses to be vaccinated. You have violated your promise to never mandate vaccines when you campaigned. It also sets precedent for a scary future. You are not exhibiting leadership. It is coercion.  - The rising inflation is hitting Americans at a time without much discretionary spending available. Inflation is the highest since the 1970s. Home prices are the highest in history. Gas prices are averaging $2 per gallon HIGHER than just 10 months ago. While it may appear great to have a wage increase in jobs it doesnt matter if the cost increase is higher to do business. Those costs are passed down to consumers or businesses stop hiring as many people.  - Your unwillingness to address crime and homelessness in the country is impacting Idaho. Look at Seattle Chicago New York Portland. Do you really believe things are going well there? We have thousands of people from these states fleeing into Idaho because of the failed policies there. This is placing tremendous pressure on Idaho infrastructure land and energy use and more.  - A really in-depth conversation is needed about your foreign and military policy. We are very disappointed in your handling of Afghanistan to put it politely. The mismanagement cost the lives of young Americans.  - You came to discuss wildfires in Idaho but it turned into statements about global warming. While we all agree in being good stewards of the environment you neglected to the discuss the mismanagement of federal lands that make up about 70% of Idaho. This increases the likelihood of devastating forest fires.  Overall if you look at many of the nations key performance indicators almost all of them are trending worse than just one year ago. You must recognize this. Your poll numbers are lower and decreasing faster than any President during their first year in office.  Please recognize that we arent seeking to condemn. We genuinely want to help. You are the President currently. If you fail America fails. Please let us know if you have time to discuss further. Wed be happy to meet with you.  Oh one last thing It seems like every time you try to take questions your microphone stops working. Wed be happy to buy you a megaphone so you dont run into these technical issues anymore.  Sincerely Idaho Young Republicans    #idpol #idleg,political,Facebook
Read full article: Congresswoman Hinson blasts Democrat spending plan  Iowa First District Congresswoman Ashley Hinson a Republican from Marion voted against raising the debt limit in the House Tuesday. We are hearing the Democrats in Washington D-C talking about cutting a trillion or two from a multitrillion-dollar social spending spree like they should get a pat on the back for that for being fiscally responsible Hinson says.  And I think it is very clear to Iowans that these are not nickles and dimes  we are dealing in trillions of dollars here. And the Democrats have forgotten how many zeros are in trillions.  Hinson says her vote sends a message on Democrat spending. It is critical of course that we do not default on our debt. But it is equally important that we dont let democrats spend as much as they want on whatever they want to. Or to signal to them that we will give them a pathway to do that in the future she says.  A proposal to have banks track accounts with 600 dollars or more in them is part of the Democrats spending proposal. Hinson is not in favor of the idea. Its a completely invasive policy we heard Speaker Pelosi acknowledge that for the first time Hinson says.  The Biden Administration says the proposal is designed to find people who are NOT paying taxes they owe. I can tell you loud and clear Iowans do not want the I-R-S to monitor when they are paying their bills or making a big grocery store run. I think about families making a big trip to Costco or HyVee and stocking up. Why does the government need to know that? Thats exactly why I have been leading the charge against this in Washington D-C with my legislation the Protecting Financial Privacy Act according to Hinson.  Hinson says the proposal is a way to expand the size of the I-R-S. We need more border patrol agents  not more I-R-S agents right now Hinson says.  Her comments came during her weekly conference call with reporters.,political,Facebook
"When a Democratic President is on the receiving end of this type of commentary from CNN it can safely be called a catastrophe:  ""Biden also ran for office in 2020 on a platform of competence and he styled himself as a foreign policy expert. It is hard to look at the debacle of recent days and see those qualities at work. Most of Biden's televised predictions -- that the Taliban wouldn't suddenly overtake Kabul and there would not be a Saigon-style exit for the US -- were wrong.""  40 years of time in office and no leadership to speak of. And for those seeking impeachment remember Biden's number two is VP Harris an absolute disaster.  The US needs authentic strong and unapologetic leadership now more than ever.",political,Facebook

As the debate about Mask Mandates continue there are many schools in Minnesota that have made it clear they will be recommending masks be worn BUT the decision about masking in school will be ultimately up to the individuals and families of their districts at this time. It is important to understand that due to an executive order signed by President Biden masks still must be worn when riding public transportation/bus.  The state is also recommending that schools maintain 3 feet of distance between students (when possible) improve ventilation and require people who test positive for COVID-19 to quarantine for 10 days. Unvaccinated people who have close contact with someone who tested positive should also stay home they said but vaccinated people don't need to stay out of school unless they show symptoms of illness.  Currently school districts can make the decision themselves regarding mask mandates and other such policies. I am personally excited to see that as of 7/22/2021  Superintendent Truebenbach is leaving the decision of masking in schools to the individuals and families of the Big Lake School district. {7/22/2021  letter to families from Superintendent Truebenbach} -concerning face coverings- *Face coverings will not be required for students or staff but are recommended for those not vaccinated. This applies only to inside school facilities and for outdoor settings. *Face coverings are required on student transportation regardless if individuals have been vaccinated. This is a federal requirement signed by President Biden and is not optional for school districts to change.  This decision joins the Big Lake District with the Elk River Anoka/Hennepin Buffalo Monticello and other school districts throughout the State of Minnesota that have chosen to keep the choice of mask use in the hands of the individual and families instead of imposing a restrictive mandate.  As we come into this new school year and the discussions about restrictive policies concerning COVID-19 continue it is important to also look at the factual statistics regarding the negative impact the pandemic restrictions had on the mental health of youth and adults alike. Some helpful resources for this information can be found here:  ---  ---   I support keeping masks and other restrictive policies of this type in the capable hands of the individuals and families throughout our District and State. Though there is an increase in cases because of the Delta Variant the science and data available currently reflect that we are nowhere near the risks we once faced.  We now have more information than we had at the beginning of the pandemic. We have vaccines and we have been able to learn about the impacts restrictive policies had on the wellbeing of our children and families. As a society we cannot afford the overall mental health academic success and interpersonal development of our youth to be compromised by emotionally charged theatrics.  Our most precious asset our youth cannot withstand having their education experiences and wellbeing be destroyed by a game of politics and fear. The solution can never be worse than the problem.,political,Facebook
Class is in session. Stand. Pledge. Sit.  Attention Trump Save America Pac donors/would be donors: Trump has not spent even a dime on ANY ballot reviews Donald Trump has been promoting.  FACT Out of the $75 Million in donations the former President has ranked in in 2021 alone donations have thus far gone to Trumps travel Trumps legal fees and Trump's staff. Much of the donations are being held in cash. Currently the Arizona recount via Cyber Ninjas is being paid for via private donations which are not being disclosed.  So when you see a post from Trump or Trumps Save America Pac that say We need you to join the fight to SECURE OUR ELECTIONS! you are just donating to one of the former Presidents most lucrative funds. NONE of this money is actually going to ANY elections previous or moving forward.  Lets look at some other elections facts because the big lie is kinda getting old now and any 12 year old that can do research for a book report could find this information if they chose to.  FACT Republicans OUTPERFORMED Democrats up and down ballot in the 2020 election.  Republicans gained 13 seats in Congress with zero losses by GOP incumbents. Every House Republican in a tossup race won. A record 35 Republican women won election to Congress. Republicans won 59 of 98 state legislative chambersa net gain of two state houses and 141 seats across the country.  FACT There are even Republicans that won in their own election in 2020 that say the election was rigged. For example in Arizona Paul Gosar and Andy Biggs both objected to the certification of the election for Joe Biden based on fraud DESPITE the fact that they won in their own elections. So if the election was rigged against Donald Trump how would Republicans then win their own seats? Paul Gosar and Andy Biggs are not the only ones. Republicans Lauren Boebert Marjorie Taylor Greene and Andrew Clyde all won in Georgia. I could go on. In other words how could Democrats able to rig the election for Joe Biden to win yet they seemingly were unable to rig down ballot elections? Shouldnt these Republicans ask for a recount of their own wins if voting in these states are in question?  And what about Dominion voting machines?  FACT Dominion software was not used in ONLY states that Trump lost and/or states that Trump has filed lawsuits in. The fact of the matter is that this software was used in TWENTY-FOUR STATES.  FACT Dominion software was used in. ONLY SIX STATES that went BLUE for Biden. These include Nevada Arizona Wisconsin Michigan Pennsylvania and Georgia. The remaining EIGHTEEN was won by Donald Trump.  FACT Donald Trump filed lawsuits in the above six states but DID NOT in the ladder eighteen.  So WHY would Dominion software be hacked in some way in just six states when these machines could have all been hacked to vote for Biden? Why JUST these six? And WHY isnt Trump filing lawsuits in ALL 24 STATES? In theory wouldnt you want to file lawsuits in every state that used Dominion as to find out what it was about just these six states machines?  And for that matter how do we know that if fraud occurred some of the dominion software in states that went red could have in the same way have been hacked to go red when they REALLY went blue?  Just totally stupid right?  So lets discuss whats really going on here with this election and just MOVE ON because this debate got stale months ago. Donald Trump lost this election for TWO main reasons.  1. Trump lost voters. These voters either switched to Biden or they did not vote for President and voted for Republicans down ballot. Here is the specific breakdown of 2020 voters per Pew:  *Biden made gains with suburban voters. In 2020 Biden improved upon Clintons vote share with suburban voters: 45% supported Clinton in 2016 vs. 54% for Biden in 2020. This shift was also seen among White voters: Trump narrowly won White suburban voters by 4 points in 2020 (51%-47%); he carried this group by 16 points in 2016 (54%-38%). At the same time Trump grew his vote share among rural voters. In 2016 Trump won 59% of rural voters a number that rose to 65% in 2020.  *Trump made gains among Hispanic voters. Even as Biden held on to a majority of Hispanic voters in 2020 Trump made gains among this group overall. There was a wide educational divide among Hispanic voters: Trump did substantially better with those without a college degree than college-educated Hispanic voters (41% vs. 30%).  *Apart from the small shift among Hispanic voters Joe Bidens electoral coalition looked much like Hillary Clintons with Black Hispanic and Asian voters and those of other races casting about four-in-ten of his votes. Black voters remained overwhelmingly loyal to the Democratic Party voting 92%-8% for Biden. Biden made gains with men while Trump improved among women narrowing the gender gap. The gender gap in the 2020 election was narrower than it had been in 2016 both because of gains that Biden made among men and because of gains Trump made among women. In 2020 men were almost evenly divided between Trump and Biden unlike in 2016 when Trump won men by 11 points. Trump won a slightly larger share of womens votes in 2020 than in 2016 (44% vs. 39%) while Bidens share among women was nearly identical to Clintons (55% vs. 54%).  *Biden improved over Clinton among White non-college voters. White voters without a college degree were critical to Trumps victory in 2016 when he won the group by 64% to 28%. In 2018 Democrats were able to gain some ground with these voters earning 36% of the White non-college vote to Republicans 61%. In 2020 Biden roughly maintained Democrats 2018 share among the group improving upon Clintons 2016 performance by receiving the votes of 33%. But Trumps share of the vote among this group  who represented 42% of the total electorate this year  was nearly identical to his vote share in 2016 (65%). Biden grew his support with some religious groups while Trump held his ground. Both Trump and Biden held onto or gained with large groups within their respective religious coalitions. Trumps strong support among White evangelical Protestants ticked up (77% in 2016 84% in 2020) while Biden got more support among atheists and agnostics than did Clinton in 2016.  *After decades of constituting the majority of voters Baby Boomers and members of the Silent Generation made up less than half of the electorate in 2020 (44%) falling below the 52% they constituted in both 2016 and 2018. Gen Z and Millennial voters favored Biden over Trump by margins of about 20 points while Gen Xers and Boomers were more evenly split in their preferences. Gen Z voters those ages 23 and younger constituted 8% of the electorate while Millennials and Gen Xers made up 47% of 2020 voters.  *A record number of voters reported casting ballots by mail in 2020  including many voters who said it was their first time doing so. Nearly half of 2020 voters (46%) said they had voted by mail or absentee and among that group about four-in-ten said it was their first time casting a ballot this way. Hispanic and White voters were more likely than Black voters to have cast absentee or mail ballots while Black voters were more likely than White or Hispanic voters to have voted early in person. Urban and suburban voters were also more likely than rural voters to have voted absentee or by mail ballot.  2. Republicans opted to not vote because they were told that the election was rigged and that their vote would not count. Donald Trump told his Republican voters for months and months prior to the election that the election would be rigged if he did not win. This is because he had internal polling that showed he was losing the election due to his handling of COVID19. As such Republicans simply did NOT make use of early voting they instead voted on election day. Conversely Democrats overwhelmingly opted to vote by mail.  And here is one last piece of data that might clear up any remaining doubt. Donald Trump did not win in 2016 by the millions and millions of voters that he says he did folks.  FACT Trumps victory was so small in fact that he actually won in 2016 because of 77000 votes in three states Michigan Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Almost three million MORE voters voted for Hillary Clinton. To put this into perspective you could fit all of the people that Trump won the election with into ONE SINGLE SMALL FOOTBALL STADIUM.  Trump isnt spending his money on election fraud claims because he knows there was no election fraud folks.  Extra Credit  Trump has been known to trick people into donating more then they had intended. Although its difficult to pinpoint an exact number of how many people were duped there is a figure that suggests lots of people ended up donating more money than they intended. Trumps campaign refunded 10.7 percent of the money raised on the Republican Partys fundraising platform WinRed. That amounted to around $122 million in online donations in 2020 ALONE.  Trump's own disclaimer notes that Trump may shift campaign-donor money into his private buisnesses.  Thats all.,political,Facebook
Dear Georgians  President Biden is implementing a spending plan designed to inflate the cost of goods and services by at least 70% over the next 2 years.

It's why you see hundreds of ships in the ocean full of products that can't be unloaded.

Since February border agents have made more than one million arrests of illegal migrants attempting to cross into our country. Thats more people than I represent in Congress  by a long shot. Its more people than the population of President Bidens entire home state of Delaware. More people are illegally crossing than weve seen in decades yet Biden continues to ignore the problem.  Our border cities are at a breaking point. Local law enforcement cannot keep up with the cartels and gangs resulting in drastic increases in crime along our border. This isnt seasonal migration its a monumental crisis. Even the far-left editorial board of the Washington Post agrees.  To make matters worse DHS reported that 1 in 5 migrant families they release into our country have tested positive for COVID putting the health of our border agents and communities along the border at high risk. The Biden Administration is doing nothing to prevent COVID-positive migrants from entering our country  in fact theyre bussing them to cities across the nation.  Biden is too busy using the power of the White House to attack political opponents that hes allowed the border crisis to spiral out of control. The failed policies of the Biden Administration are directly to blame.  Enough is enough we need real leadership to restore security to our Southern border.,political,Facebook

"Over the past few months President Biden continues to push America towards an authoritarian state. He recently announced a proposal that financial institutions report transactional activity for any bank account that has an inflow outflow or aggregate amount totaling $600 in a year.  This bar for monitoring is so low that most citizens on unemployment social security benefits and Medicare would have every financial transaction monitored.  To bring it to a more personal level if your child takes a summer job mowing lawns and opens a savings account for that funding then he or she would likely be monitored as well.  While the stated goal of this vast data collection is to uncover tax dodging by the wealthy this proposal is not remotely targeted to that purpose or population.  Last time we checked the median household here in Idaho is roughly $61000 a year. Nearly every Idahoan family would be on that list from monitoring as one of the ""rich"" paying their share.  The false pretense of closing the tax-gap would give unprecedented data collection authority to the federal government with limited return on investment for citizens.  It is also unclear how the IRS will use this data to accomplish its goal.  Further the federal governments history of keeping this type of data secure is dubious at best. The IRS is one of several government systems that has recently experienced a data breach and financial institutions across the country are highly concerned about the governments ability to keep personal financial data secure.  Lets be real this is an unprecedented invasion of privacy masquerading as an effort to reduce the tax gap.  This is not acceptable and Congress must act.",political,Facebook

Friends youve heard about the news from Kabul. Two suicide bomb attacks killed thirteen U.S. service members and wounded eighteen other troops. At least 90 Afghans were killed.  Yesterday was the deadliest single day for the U.S. military in Afghanistan in a decade.  Our hearts ache for the loss of life and the broken families left behind. It hurts all the more that this atrocity was avoidable.  I said in April that President Biden was committing a grave error in extending the May 1 withdrawal date negotiated by President Trump. I said that if any additional American soldiers died between May 1 and September 11 the responsibility would fall squarely on Joe Bidens shoulders.  It has happened.  The last American should have departed by May before the start of the fighting season. Instead thousands have been put in harms way to suit Joe Bidens needlessly extended timetable.  Its a failure of leadership.  Luckily our truce with the Taliban negotiated by President Trump has held as we evacuate the remaining Americans in-country. The attacks were committed by an ISIS affiliate who is also an enemy to the Taliban.  The most important thing moving forward that we must remember is that nothing has changed. Afghanistan is no more critical to U.S. national security than it was one week ago. We are right to leave. A withdrawalno matter how poorly managedis preferential to continuing a war without purpose.  Do not allow a terrorist attack to dictate U.S. foreign policy.  Some peopleboth Republicans and Democratswant to reinvade the whole country. Not only would this be a strategic mistake but the attacks we saw yesterday would become a daily occurrence. Most Americans agree the costs are not worth another decade of war and occupation.  We pray that those thirteen lives are the last ones to be needlessly sacrificed in Afghanistan.

I wanted to share an update on my most recent work in Washington to support Iowas biofuel industry and promote the use of higher ethanol blends:  1. I helped introduce bipartisan legislation with Rep. Cindy Axne to extend the Biodiesel Tax Credit through 2025. This will provide certainty for our biofuel producers in Iowa as well as truckers who keep our supply chain up and running.  2. I joined Senators Ernst and Grassley as well as Representatives Miller-Meeks and Feenstra in a letter to President Biden expressing our disappointment that his infrastructure proposals prioritizes $174 billion in electric vehicle subsidies while ignoring biofuels and urging him to prioritize biofuels in the final infrastructure package.

Everywhere you turn in 2021 the environmentalists are pushing to limit fossil fuels or decarbonize the economy. At first blush that would seem bad for the energy sector but it appears just the reverse as the price of Brent and WTi continue to steadily climb to their highest prices since 2018. Why? The elite have had more success in curtailing production than they have had in curtailing demand which is improving with an improving economy.  Watch the headlines activists Larry Fink and Black Rock supported a new hedge funds effort to unseat two Exxon board members sighting Environmental Social & Corporate Governance (ESG) guidelines to reduce Exxons slow action in reducing emissions. Across the Atlantic European oil giants are reducing major drilling plans to curry favor with ESG advocates.  The goal of many of these activists is the de-carbonization of the U.S. and world economies.

I am vaccinated. My family and I made the very real and personal decision to take the vaccine because we believe that to be the best way to stay safe from COVID-19. I have encouraged others  family friends and constituents alike  to do the same.  But the best thing about America is the freedom to make these decisions for ourselves  as individuals. It is not the responsibility of the federal government to decide for individuals whether or not to take the vaccine. Joe Bidens unprecedented vaccine mandates tells millions of Americans that they have but one choice: get the shot  or else you lose your ability to earn a living pay your bills and feed your family.

Our representatives have failed us.  On Thursday the CDC announced a recommendation that all K-12 students and staff should wear masks at all times. Under normal circumstances this would mean that the State Government and the local school boards would then consider those recommendations through the eyes of the locality and decide whether or not the locality should follow the new recommendation.  But these arent normal circumstances. We live in an age where self-proclaimed conservatives on the Bedford Board of Supervisors refused to stand up to Northam. Where local Republicans voted for a resolution to commend our local Delegates and Senators even though two of them (Kathy Byron and Steve Newman) voted to give the Commissioner of Health the power to mandate vaccines for the way they handled Northam. We live in an age where Bedford County Deputies are called upon regarding Second Amendment supporters protesting a Delegate that voted for Red Flag Laws. By the way right before COVID was even heard of Bedford County voted to become a Second Amendment Sanctuary County.  During the First Special Session of the General Assembly this year Republican Senator Dunnavant submitted SB1303 which passed with the support of every single Republican including our area representatives Kathy Byron Wendell Walker Terry Austin and Steve Newman which delegated authority from the State and the local School Boards and handed them to the Biden Controlled CDC. Remember the CDC is comprised of non-elected bureaucrats.  It states For the purposes of this act each school board shall (i) adopt implement and when appropriate update specific parameters for the provision of in-person instruction and (ii) provide such in-person instruction in a manner in which it adheres to the maximum extent practicable to any currently applicable mitigation strategies for early childhood care and education programs and elementary and secondary schools to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 that have been provided by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  On Thursday the CDC recommended and therefore made it law in Virginia to mask all students and teachers. Like the Board of Supervisors cowered and caved on the First Amendment issues the Bedford County School Board did the same by refusing to nullify the CDC mandates.  We live in extraordinary times. We need to ask extraordinary question like: what happens when the CDC recommends that K-12 students should have the COVID-19 Vaccine?  One of the arguments being made by the bill sponsor and some of those who voted for this bill is Northam is making an incorrect interpretation and the new mask mandate wasnt legislative intent. Heres the problem with that explanation a judge only has the four corners of a document to work with (which intent is absent from) and legal precedent and thanks to the Supreme Court ruling on Jacobson v Massachusetts (which is what was used for Buck v Bell) a state legislature can make public health decisions. Our officials who voted on this bill SHOULD KNOW THIS.  How much longer are you going to believe the lies of our current Republican leaders who just expect you to take their word because they are elected and you shouldnt attack other Republicans?

A Liberal Explains the Cause of High Gas Prices Forget the fact that Joe Biden killed the Keystone Pipeline deal and cost the U.S. thousands of jobs and forget that he put a moratorium on all new oil and gas leases on federal land and offshore waters. Dont think about how he is suffocating domestic oil production with mandates such as establishing comprehensive standards of performance and emission guidelines from existing oil and gas operations by September 2021 and ordering Texas to submit State Implementation Plan for Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) by January 2022. Of course these policies will make us no longer energy independent and U.S. oil imports are expected to rise 2 million barrels per day by 2030 and U.S. gross domestic product will be declining $700 billion during the same span but that is not why gas prices are rising. Neither is fact that U.S. oil production is expected to decline 230000 barrels a day in 2021. Right-wing nut job conspiracy theorists and QAnon will tell you that is reason gas prices are going up. Those people are spreading disinformation! They might even try to tell you how Joe Biden waived sanctions on Russias pipeline while at the same time pulling the plug on our own Keystone pipeline which infuriated one of our strongest allies in Canada. While he did give our Russian enemy the same thing he took away from our neighboring Canadian allies that is not why gas prices are high. And dont think about how he hamstrung domestic oil production then recently turned around and asked OPEC to produce more oil instead of figuring out a way for the U.S. to produce more oil even though he ran on an America first platform. His inconsistent messaging and terrible policies have nothing to do with the high price of gas. That is nothing more than a right-wing conspiracy being spread by unsophisticated xenophobic white supremacists. These people probably want you to think about his rhetoric during the 2020 campaign when he called Saudi Arabia a pariah state with no redeeming social value only to see Saudi Arabia retaliate immediately after Joe Biden took office by committing to unilaterally cut 1 million barrels of oil. People spreading disinformation want you to believe that they did this to pressure Joe Biden into not penalizing Saudi Arabias crown prince Mohammed bin Salam for directly approving the killing of Jamal Khashoggi the Washington Post columnist who was drugged and dismembered in 2018. They probably also want you to believe it worked too and how Joe Biden did nothing to hold Mohammed bin Salam accountable for fear of upsetting U.S. Arabian allies. Some people might even argue that he failed on the humanitarian front by not seeking justice for the killing of an American citizen and he also failed on an economic front as well by allowing himself to be bullied by the Saudis. Even though this is a blatant lie let's just say he did fail on multiple fronts by not taking a clear position on that foreign policy decision. So what? That is not the reason gas prices are going up. In fact none of Joe Bidens terrible policies or bad decisions have anything to do with the price of gas today. Any expert will tell you that it is physically impossible for Joe Biden to cause a rise in the price of gas. Follow the science. All the data suggests that a man who wears aviator shades and eats ice cream could never screw anything up so bad that gas prices could rise 50% in just 8 months. It is metaphysically impossible. Blaming Joe Biden for the rise in gas prices is nothing more than a wild conspiracy theory. The real reason that gas prices are so high today are because of one man and one man alone. DONALD J.

Club Cedar and Cedar Cafe sit in the historic Russell neighborhood on the corner of 26th and Cedar street. The Russell neighborhood only has about 15-19% home ownership. That means upwards of 80% of our neighbors rent their home. These same neighbors have patronized and supported us over the years and we will not turn our backs on them.  How we can help: As many know I am the new owner only taking over in December but as a real estate investor/developer I have a special set of skills and friends that may be able to help keep you in your home and ease tensions if any with your current landlord. I do understand landlords I have some of the same problems. But what I cant allow are folks to be evicted and all they needed was an advocate who also understands the game. The help we can offer is advocating on your behalf with your landlord or local bank. Our goal is to keep you housed! And come up with different financial terms that work for everyone.

"Why is Joe Biden at war with The American People ? He is almost always holding millions of American people in contempt and reprimanding them. In this day and age of audio and video how can you change what you say and your position in a matter of days. Even Jen Psaki his press secreatary seems to lie about what she previously says almost all the time. It is a daily occurrence with this administration. Idiots it is recorded by audio and video in your own words. You look more stupid false and fraudulent. One minute they say that they will not mandate a vaccine shot the next minute they say they will mandate vaccinations. They are such liars and hypocrites almost on every subject they talk about. They left Americans behind in Afghanistan when they in their own words said that they would not leave any Americans behind. Biden is now accusing the people for the problems he and his administation have created. For every failure it is someone else who is at fault according to him. You would think that after almost 50 years in public service you would have learnt some basic lessons of governing and leadership but not Joe Biden. He has always been wrong and now he is a catastrophe on domestic and foreign policy. The country is in such unease and in so much distress and fear.

In September the Biden Administration proposed a new rule that would expand the IRSs data collection on millions of Americans. The rule would require financial institutions and other financial service providers to report all inflows and outflows on accounts that have more than $600. This proposal would be a huge privacy issue for Americans and create an expensive undue burden on our local banks and credit unions.  Here are 5 ways that you could find yourself surveilled by the agency:  1. Sending your child to college. You worked hard you saved and now that investment in your childs future will pull you into the IRS dragnet.  2. Taking out a loan to buy equipment. Want to start a new business or invest in your current one? Thatll cost you your privacy.  3. Selling goods at a farmers market or Etsy shop. Do you create something or grow something and sell it directly to a consumer? If you did and deposited those dollars into a bank account youll be reported.  4. Saving for and making a large purchase. Want to buy a new car? Or do some home renovations? Or take your family on a trip? Your bank accounts will wind up in a dragnet.  5. Purchasing groceries for a family of four. With the cost of groceries skyrocketing under inflation  your account will be reported to the IRS even sooner.  Over the last several weeks Americans have voiced their outrage over this invasion of privacy including countless Middle and South Georgians. In response to the public outcry Congressional Democrats and the Biden Administration are trying to save face but proposed updates to the proposed rule would still pose a gross overreach into the private financial lives of Americans.

The democrats totally control the elections and have systems and activists and rules that will make it almost impossible for the republicans to win in any consequential election or positions. The republicans are asleep at the switch and are not taking any measures to stop election fraud and rigging votes and elections. In 2022 the democrats will cheat and win and keep control because they will eliminate ID requirements signature verifications and allow fake and manipulated mail in ballots. They have a well constructed ""machinery"" to rig the elections at whatever cost. This will be also be aided by suppression polls a corrupt and biased media to vilify and demonize their opponents and tampered vote counting machines that will switch votes from their opponents to their people. Charles Akin : When you control the election process you can control who is in power and how long they are there. Those of you waiting on the red tide of the midterms well it just aint going to happen folks. Dont get me wrong. Im going to be there when the voting booth opens and will vote red all the way. But I am a realist and 100% sure of the outcome before the last vote is counted. It will be a blue landslide. They will have complete control of both houses. Because they will have complete control of the election mechanism. Then and only then will the Dems proceed with either a 25th amend move or impeachment over the Failed Afghan Withdrawal. But dont get excited. After the Harris Biden admin is ousted you will have to deal with the Pelosi Whom-ever Admin. And no Hillary will not be visible. Note that I did not say she wouldnt be participating just that she wouldnt be visible.",political,Facebook

Ron DeSantis Says Monoclonal Antibody Brought Florida COVID ER Visits Down 70 Percent  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has said that monoclonal antibody treatment is having a significant effect on COVID cases in his state as he continues to lock horns with the Biden administration over the distribution of the therapy.  Since Florida opened monoclonal antibody treatment sites in August:   +100000 Floridians have received treatments  COVID hospital admissions have fallen by over 60%  COVID hospital census has declined for 28 consecutive days  ER visits for COVID have declined by over 70%  If you have gotten the China virus you know that your biggest challenge is trying to find a doctor who will TREAT you!  In Florida DeSantis tried to change that by opening treatment centers all over the state to make the monoclonal antibody infusion available to everyone who qualified. In the month of August this treatment was done uninterrupted. The results or the facts on this treatment are impressive.  So of course the federal Biden government is trying to stop the ability of everyone to get the infusion. You would think that they would look at Florida and then roll this out to make it standard care treatment for everyone in every state. But no that would make too much sense.  The Biden Regime has doubled down hard on making the unproven unsuccessful vaccine the ONLY treatment.  Shame on Joe Biden and his administration!

The United States military has almost forever been a model of racial harmony & brotherhood white  black or other. Even based on religious grounds the harmony & unity was always there. Its amazing how the dormant high ranking Marxist generals & superiors are so concerned about critical race theory all of a sudden! They are dividing people in the armed forces to please their extremist political bosses! Shame on them. Biden continues the divisions Obama started ! The most astounding fact is how these Politicians these generals these people are in the high positions they are. Some of the highest ranking military officials have been black & rightfully so ! The Commander in Chief for 8 years was black too elected by a majority white people !

"My name is Amy Washburn and I'm running for Congress as a Democrat in 2022. My opponent the Republican incumbent is this guy who voted against COVID aid three times & impeachment twice; who thinks it should be okay to pay disabled workers less than the minimum wage; and who thinks that taking vitamin D works better to prevent COVID than the vaccines.  In March this guy claimed tax credits in the new COVID relief bill were ""anti-marriage"" and that it was all the fault of the Black Lives Matter movement. The hat he wore during the interview is the least of the problems here. Click the link below to watch the video:   In April this guy sent email to constituents in which he opposed DC statehood for a number of specious reasons the inaccuracy of which I detailed in a Twitter thread - click here to read the thread:   This guy also sent email to constituents stating that he introduced a House Resolution to recognize the significant role vitamin D may play in the fight against COVID-19 & that studies show a strong correlation between vitamin D deficiencies & negative COVID-19 patient outcomes including severe symptoms hospital stays ICU admittance and overall mortality rate. In fact a correlation has been shown by some studies but not others. The article linked below says its too soon to tell if Vitamin D can help to prevent COVID: there's no firm evidence that vitamin D supplements curb people's risk of infection or serious Covid-19 illness.   This guy explained his vote against the HEROES Act by saying that the bill strips states of their right to administer elections a claim Politifact rated as false.   This guy *chewed on his pen* while on camera during a COVID committee meeting! Again see for yourself:  This guy is trying to block Green Card Holders from getting federal help claiming that President Bidens plan to get up to 11M illegal immigrants on a path to citizenship will ""prompt 'many' to 'use their new legal status to apply for additional welfare benefits and not work.'""   Many Green Card Holders got that status by marrying US citizens. Many have US citizen children. None of them are here illegally. This guys bill were it to become law would block even those Green Card Holders from receiving federal help of any kind. It should also be noted that actual illegal immigrants are already prohibited from receiving most welfare benefits except for WIC & a few emergency relief programs.  This guy doesnt want to give back pay to all federal employees both those who work and those who dont"" after government shutdowns implying that some federal employees somehow don't work.   This guy is concerned about his winning elections not your voting rights:   This guy thinks that same-sex marriage is an insult to Civil War soldiers (really not kidding):   Im running against this guy:   This guy:   This guy:   This guy:   This guy:   This guy:   This guy:   This guy:   This guy:   This guy:   Somehow despite all of the above this guy just won re-election by a 20-point margin (I wasnt on the ballot) and he has $1.2M in his warchest.

7-12-2021 Wildfire emergency out west. Today I'm going to coin the acronym SAAF for Satellite activated autonomous Firefighting.

"RESIDENTS CONFLICTED OVER WATER TREATMENT PLANT REPAIRS For years elected officials have talked about and agreed that our water plant is in serious need of some repairs and at risk of failing hundreds of thousands of people. Millions of dollars have been squandered by past elected officials some still sitting today on frivolous projects instead of performing the needed repairs on our main water plant. Now the decision has to be made to issue the nearly $100 million dollars worth of debt that tax payers will be on the hook for or vote it down. The pay back would be 30-40 years and a whopping $164 million dollars. Certificates of Obligation are paid back by property taxes or other local revenues. The issuance of this debt would almost certainly lead to many property tax increases over a 40 year period along with some water rate increases unless paid back quickly.  An alternative to issuing this debt is for City Council and City Management to be responsible stewards of the people's money and use the funds they have available to pay for the plant repairs without issuing this debt. The city recently received 21.8 million dollars from Biden's American Rescue Plan that could be applied to the plants repairs receives about $15 million dollars per year from the Pioneer Energy Contract for the purchase of the cities wastewater and Odessa Development Corporation could contribute $20 million dollars to the repairs it is your sales tax dollars anyway. This is half of what the project will cost and the rest can be made up from the general fund and future Pioneer revenue. The repairs can be done without issuing more debt or raising property taxes and water rates. The problem with this plan is that Tom Sprawls Detra White Steve Thompson and Mari Willis  current City Council members want to use the available monies on ""fun or frivolous projects"" rather than the water treatment plant.  There is little doubt that the water treatment plant must be repaired sooner than later. The question is how the repairs are paid for. Do we allow a 40 year payout or do we replace some of our current city council members and elect some help for our conservative members that are trying to do the right by their constituents? If debt has to be written to do these repairs then I say vote Sprawls Willis and White out of office Dave Ramsey up and pay this debt off in less than 5 years so that the repairs can be made without raising peoples taxes and water rates. These millions of dollars that are available should be allotted to the water project. There should be no more pet projects or frivolous spending until the basic needs of the people are met.  People have mixed feelings about this project and do not know who or what to believe only that they do not want to be without water. Odessa's City Council will vote on this issue July 27th 2021. If you are for this debt then make sure to hold your council members accountable in how they pay it back. If you are against the debt you may sign a petition at any one of the following locations prior to July 27th.

"Because Joe Biden insists on attacking the unvaccinated we now find ourselves at a place in history where Americans are cheering on the fact that their fellow Americans are being ostracized from everyday life. Even here in a red state like Texas where life liberty and property are supposed to be hallmarks of society every day we are seeing more and more Texans being removed from their jobs schools and other stations in life for simply making a health decision best fits their life situation.  And that divide only deepens when we see Biden and the democrats saying things like the unvaccinated people were ""not nearly as smart as I thought you were."" We see the media pushing narratives like blaming the unvaccinated for the continuation of the pandemic Biden's poor approval numbers hindering economic growth costing jobs and putting unnecessary strain on the healthcare system.  We now live in a country where our borders are being overwhelmed; consumer prices are nearing record highs inflation is quickly pushing us towards a recession employers cannot find help and spending is out of control. And the most common narrative being pushed out of the Whitehouse and in the media is that the unvaccinated are being labeled unemployable and are being ostracized from society so that we can protect the vaccinated from the unvaccinated because the unvaccinated refuse to get the vaccine that didn't protect the vaccinated in the first place.  Personal agency over our own lives is one of the most fundamental tenents of a free society. If you have chosen to be vaccinated because you believe it protects you and it is what's best for you then it shouldn't matter if others are vaccinated because you are protected. And if you are unvaccinated because you believe that it is your right to make healthcare decisions for yourself and your family then what someone else's healthcare choices are should be none of your concern. We have somehow found ourselves in this quasi-socialist communist place where too many Americans now believe the interests of society somehow trump those of the individual. Our nation was founded on the rights of the individual not those of the community. And if we desire to continue to remain a free society and have personal agency over our lives we must move away from this collectivist ideology and return to the ideology of individual rights spelled out by our founders which has served us well for nearly 250 years.  And it starts by electing people who are willing to stand up for you and fight for your individual rights. I will go to Austin to represent you! Not the special interest groups and lobbyists.

Mandating over 100 million Americans to receive the COVID-19 vaccination is both unprecedented and a complete overreach of the federal government. Its clear that the COVID-19 vaccine saves lives and I have and will continue to encourage Kansans to get it. With that being said I firmly believe that every American has the constitutional right to consult with their healthcare provider and decide what's best for them and their families.  Additionally these mandates are a crushing blow to Kansas small businesses as they try to get back on their feet and navigate the growing labor shortage. Our hospitals are already stretched thin with medical professionals in rural Kansas and cannot afford to lose workers who do not wish to be vaccinated.  President Biden using the power of the White House to mandate and force private businesses to comply with federal mandates is dictatorial behavior and completely unacceptable. I will continue to do everything I can in Congress to fight against these federal mandates to help ensure personal liberty and freedom for all Kansans.,political,Facebook

The United States of America helped win World War 1 and won and beat Hitler and Nazism and the Japanese imperialists in World War 2. The U.S. helped millions of Eastern Europeans gain freedom from the tyrannical Soviet Union and the brutal Communist regimes. It prevented South Korea from having to share the terrible fate that rules North Korea. Without the U.S. the world would be a different place. It would be a terrible world with dictatorships and global tyranny in most countries. Yet this superpower just left a country Afghanistan in the most unprofessional incompetent manner possible. This happened after 20 years of blood sweat and tears and trillions of American taxpayer money. Why did this happen ? It happened because of a mentally deranged and disturbed incompetent leader who is stricken by dementia and mental disabilities with an inflated ego. He left his people as hostages. The U.S. Had military personnel and bases and airport control and 300000 Afghani military men and women with billions of modern weapons. It voluntarily gave up this position of control to the Taliban a terrorist organization. VOLUNTARILY ! It did this before evacuating American citizens and Afghani allies and taking all the lates weaponry. ! Biden took the worst option possible. The complete truth about what happened and why is not clear yet but Biden truly screwed up and made another secret deal with the Taliban and the Chinese. This man is truly callous and a murderous traitor. He has abandoned Americans and Afghani aliies for political reasons. He does not care about human life even his own people. He lies with every opportunity and has his people lie too. Biden took a position of complete power and control and exchanged it with a position of weakness and lack of control and chaos and is dependent on a terrorist regime for the fate of Americans abandoned there.

Letter to the Editor as published 7/17 in the Park Record. Thank you for the kind words Cami I do truly care about Park City and believe strongly in serving the community.  ______________________________ Rubell is the right choice  Although I live in Summit County and therefore can not vote in the upcoming elections in Park City I wanted to express my support for Jeremy Rubell for Park City Councilor and urge voters in Park City to seriously consider voting for him. I have found Jeremy to be an individual who truly cares about our community. Hes an unusual candidate in that he doesnt really act like a typical politician and appears to be someone who truly cares about the future of Park City. I have talked to him about where he stands on a number of important issues facing the city and believe he will seek out the support and counsel of others to make the right decision. I also truly appreciate his support for the LGBTQ+ community here in Summit County. So heres the deal (as Joe Biden would say) there are a lot of good candidates but theres only one Jeremy Rubell. Vote for Jeremy.  Cami Richardson,political,Facebook

9/1/2021 Harlingen City Commission Meeting  Here is a quick synopsis of yesterdays Harlingen City Commission meeting:  1. The week of September 10-16 was proclaimed as Mexican Independence Week in Harlingen Texas.  2. We solicited comments from the public regarding the adoption of the 2022 Annual Budget.   3. We approved several Special Use Permits (SUP) including a new micro blading studio and a new tattoo venue.  4. We provided the citys attorney and his firm a 30 day notice for their services. (This decision was not as easy one but ultimately one that I felt was in the best interest of the city)  5. We established new rental rates for the food and vendor booths that will be coming with the expansion of Market Days beginning in October. ( I am very excited for this.)   6. We gave direction to staff in the awarding of engineering services for the drainage projects under President Bidens Rescue Plan Act of 2021.   7. We approved the Valley International Airports Budget for 21-22.   8. We established a COVID-19 Incentive Program to encourage vaccinations.

We adopted the Long Term Strategic Vision created by the commission during a retreat a month ago.  Once again these are just a few of the items we discussed and took action on. I will provide the link to the video of the meeting in another post for those that want to know or see more.  *As always thank you to everyone who attended the meeting made public comments or participated in the process.  Remember participating in the civil discourse is the right and duty of every American.   God Bless and be safe.,political,Facebook
"Cedrick Richmond you have no clue. It is blue state mayors and governors and hooligans and thugs that wanted to defund the police not Republicans ! Crime has gone up because of inept advisors and propaganda artists like yourself who demonized the police and not because of more guns. You let criminals out time after time so that crime would rise so that you could push your false narrative that guns are the cause of increase in crime. Pure misinformation manipulation and lies.Shame on you you're a puppet and an ideologue clueless and senseless and you serve the puppet in chief Biden. Guns will always be available to ciminals and reducing police forces and defunding and demoralizing them increases murder rates and crime.

Air Force Gen. Glen D. VanHerck Commander of NORAD and U.S. Northern Command today during a press conference on Afghan evacuees: I would venture - Im speculating a little bit- that the vast majority are not SIVs at this time. They are asylum seekers that will be determined how were going to work them through the process by DHS as the lead federal agency.  Hundreds of Afghan Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) holders who supported Americas military mission were left behind along with an unknown sum of Americans. Many were abandoned at the Kabul airport gates by President Biden and Secretary Blinken and now theyve admitted that a vast majority of the people they brought to the United States were neither American citizen nor SIVs.  President Biden and Secretary Blinken described the evacuation as a success. Either they made a horrible mistake or this was intentional.  We will continue to do everything we can to get Americans and SIVs out of Afghanistan. Our people deserve better and America deserves the truth.,political,Facebook

Indiana State Rep John Jacob's Call to Ban Mandatory Covid Vaccines and Vaccine Passports or Any Kind of Vaccination Proof  STOP THE TYRANNY FROM DC AND WITHIN INDIANA!!  We must stop the Covid vaccine mandate and vaccine passport or any kind of vaccination proof . We must do this at the local level. We as a state can put a stop to this and reject the mandates that the Biden administration have launched against us.  This is CRIMINAL!! This is High Treason from the highest office in the land.  If we cave into this tyranny and control we must ask ourselves what are we leaving the next generation? To our children grandchildren and all the future generations to come? The answer is slavery we are leaving our children in the throes of tyrannical slavery!  We MUST STOP this craziness in its tracks immediately! This is a dictatorial authoritarian power play!  The Biden administration and the government are weaponizing businesses against us we the people. This is a well-planned strategic war plan against the American people.  Call to Action  Call the Speaker of the House Speaker Huston and Senate Pro Tem Senator Bray. Politely demand they take action when they reconvene for the redistricting session in a couple weeks. The legislature does not need the approval of the Governor they can and must draft present and vote legislation into law to ban mandatory Covid vaccines and vaccine passports or any kind of vaccination proof. If Governor Holcomb vetoes it then the house and the senate can overturn it.  They absolutely do not have to wait until the 2022 session. The Speaker of the House and Senate Pro Tem have the authority to decide if this will be addressed and if they will take action to protect fellow Hoosiers. If Speaker Huston and Senate Pro Tem Bray and the other GOP legislators do nothing now by then 2022 it will be too late and people will have lost their jobs and their livlihoods. If they do nothing now it is utterly shameful and they are proving they care nothing about you the people of the great state of Indiana. If they do nothing now to protect you us... they in fact are showing they hate us and we mean nothing.  THIS IS COERCION!  This is outrageous unacceptable and must be stopped NOW! I urge all Hoosiers to to be brave and take a stand and put a stop/pause to their criminal actions. You wont just be protecting yourself but your family and friends. Youll also protect others across the state of Indiana and America in the midst of everything by blazing forward for liberty and freedom.  America is at a crisis crossroads and if we continue down this downward spiral into destruction we may not be able to return to any form of sanity.

"Errors mistakes blunders incompetence failures that is Biden & his administration. It's a comedy of errors except it is no comedy but rather a ""tragedy of errors"" ! Just when you think the incompetence could not be any worse you find out that it is much worse. The Afghanistan withdrawal was a complete unnecessary disaster and we lost dozens of innocent lives including 13 of our own soldiers. Only God knows how many Americans we have left hopelessly behind. The government will not tell us the truth. Today we found out that the drone strike killed 10 innocent people 7 of which were children and not any terrorist as previously claimed. This is atrocious and criminal and Biden should go on trial with those inept generals and commanders in charge. Biden rushed to action to "" correct"" his blunderous withdrawal and killed innocent people. How can you be so stupid yet so arrogant ? To the MSM and the social media giants who so eagerly helped pull off a coup against a true leader and replace him with a senile incompetent imbecile CONGRATULATIONS! Are you happy now ? are you better off ? Is the country and the world safer ? How about you brilliant Biden voters ? Happy now ? Do you enjoy Biden who never takes real questions and when he does it is all scripted & full of lies and he just walks away. Do you enjoy his propagandist representatives who all lie and misrepresent the truth when they are questioned. How come you hypocrites do not fact check them ? Was it not time worthy for you to fact check that the drone strike did NOT kill ISIS-K terrorists but innocent people including children. Would you have checked this if Trump was in charge ? What ideology do you serve ? Deceit fraud lies and incompetence as long as it is a democrat in charge. Even the Vaccine has been politicized and today the FDA rejected the Pfizer booster plan. You are all a part of the tragedy of errors and the reason this country is going down. Everything Biden has done has been totally incompetent and tragic including the terrible border crisis with hundreds of thousands of migrants coming in illegally.

The news was trying to sort it out when I witnessed the live shot of the second plane hit. Let us remember those that have their lives that day. The innocent civilians that had just become targets of war we didnt know we were fighting. The heroes of the NYPD and FDNY whom sacrificed their lives trying to save others. The passengers of flight 93 who realized they would not survive the ordeal and decided to take control of the aircraft from the terrorists that were targeting DC. The military and civilian personnel in the Pentagon.

AFGHANISTAN WHAT EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD KNOW  Today was a tough day. A sad day. A day that should have and could have been prevented. Today was the greatest single loss of life our American military has suffered in ten years. In fact this whole fiasco or my better stated this catastrophe could have been prevented. To provide you a better understanding of the current situation and how/why we are where we are please allow me to provide some background and much needed truth and even better truth in context.  Over the last few days I have directly and personally spoken with and heard from former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo former DNI John Ratcliffe and the current Secretaries of Defense State Homeland Security Director of National Intelligence and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. The following is the best and most honest account and assessment I can provide to my constituents and the American People without divulging any specific classified information.  PRESIDENT TRUMPS PLAN FOR WITHDRAWAL  On Feb 29 2020 Pres Trump announced he had reached an agreement to withdraw American forces from Afghanistan by May 2021. This deal was a conditions based withdrawal and if certain conditions werent being met the US reserved the right to delay or tear up the deal. These conditions?  The Taliban would agree to  cut all ties with Al-Queda enter into a peaceful power sharing agreement with the Afghani Govt led by Pres Ghani Honor all checkpoints manned by Afghan troops Not to attack or destabilize provincial capitals protect the rights of women & minorities not attack US Troops  Now as you may have guessed the Taliban didnt always live up to their side of the bargain. They probed. They violated. On numerous occasions. And somewhat of a cycle would play out.  1. Taliban violates agreement 2. US hits back hard with Afghan ground forces with strong US air cover. 3. Taliban retreats 4. Americans reach out via back channels 5. Taliban properly disciplined agrees not to repeat  And these (mostly) minor violations would continue with the same result. You see they were probing and testing our resolve. They wanted to see what they could get away with. If they were met with strength? Theyd back off. But If they were met with weakness then you can guess how they would have responded. Well you dont have to guess because in 2021 they met with mush and as we witnessed they grew increasingly emboldened and aggressive.  At this point we need to be fair and absolutely clear. Had President Trump served another term none of us know exactly how this withdrawal would have played out. We dont. And we never will. For sure anyway. But there are some pretty strong clues that point to a very different outcome.  First Pres Trump listened intently to his advisors on this issue and adjusted his own perception and plans accordingly. He was deeply committed to getting all Americans out and if necessary our proven Afghan allies. He was also just as committed to ensuring that the Taliban if they came to power would get nothing nada zilch not one piece of American equipment. I was told repeatedly by folks that were in the room with the President that he wanted and I quote Not even a styrofoam cooler with an American flag on it left behind. He also said more than once Not a single bullet not one. Not a single American bullet is gonna be left.  So how did we get from that to where we are today?  Many in the Biden Administration and some of their media allies are trying to push out the myth that the unraveling of the Afghan Govt and military caught even the intelligence community by surprise. This is an utter and provable lie. When Pres Trump would meet with his intel team he would ask every time if conditions are not met and honored how long do you all think the Afghanis will last? EVERY voice shared the same assessment. Most likely a few weeks. At best a month or two. The President himself often would share that he didnt think theyd last two days. Without agreed upon conditions being a reality a clear disaster awaited.  And theres some strong evidence that points to the fact that this would almost assuredly played out differently under a Trump Administration. From the day the agreement was reached over the next year and a half not one American was lost to anger in Afghanistan. We drew down from 15000 to 2500 troops and there was enviable stability. Today we have twice as many boots on the ground and we have chaos.  For years in Afghanistan we would root out and kill bad guys and now we are begging for mercy from some of these very same thugs. Now the Taliban have more Blackhawk helicopters than the nation of Australia. Toss a $50 M67 grenade into a $20 million Blackhawk and viola no more high tech weaponry in the hands of the Taliban or Iran or China. The obvious best case scenario for the $85 billion worth of equipment left behind would have been for us to take the valuable stuff out with us. But failing that its inexcusable and quite frankly unforgivable that it wasnt destroyed before falling into enemy hands. There are reports that Blackhawks and other highly sensitive and advanced weaponry is already being couriered to Iran and China. And if true which it almost certainly is wed have to expect that China is going to do everything within their power to reverse engineer our cutting edge technology.  Please allow me to be crystal clear. What we have witnessed in the last two months is not a failure of intelligence in any way it is a failure to accept/acknowledge the intelligence and take appropriate action. The Afghanistan catastrophe and the subsequent loss of life equipment and prestige is a failure of leadership.  Joe Biden moved the original May 1st deadline to August 31st. While I agreed then and still do now that the original deadline needed to be moved Aug 31st was not the right time. It was obvious by the Spring the Taliban were acting in bad faith. Other than laying off our troops they werent honoring the terms of the agreement. They were making moves to simply wait us out and then strike against the Afghan government the moment we left. Under just such a scenario we were really left with two choices. Ramp back up and stay put or leave but leave at the beginning of winter evac all but a skeleton crew of American civilians AND have executable plans in place to withdraw any and all Americans that remained and proven Afghan allies and then destroy all sensitive equipment that couldnt be removed. Unfortunately and tragically no such plans were ever drawn up and the deadline wasnt moved.  In Afghanistan fighting is seasonal. Always has been. The climate is unmerciful and the Afghan winter doesnt lend itself to being all that conducive to combat operations. The fighting season begins in the spring and ends in the late fall. In the winter months over the past several decades many Taliban fighters would head over to Pakistan to rest and recoup. If Biden knew the Feb 2020 agreed upon conditions werent being honored (they werent) and if he was still hellbent on leaving (he was) the very least he should have done was set a Dec departure. This way the fledging Ghani Govt and military could have had 4-5 months to get their footing and build confidence in themselves and one another. This would simply have given them the best chance for success. Again no guarantees they would have survived but not giving them this opportunity was criminally negligent.  So where are we now and where do we go from here?  On July 8th Joe Biden said in no uncertain terms he didnt trust the Taliban. I believe If Im not mistaken he reiterated that same sentiment again today. So that begs the question. If thats true Sir why are you reportedly sharing sensitive contact information and the whereabouts of American citizens with THE TALIBAN? If this is proven to be true Id say it rises to the level of an impeachable offense. Further Mr Biden said today that he would retaliate against those who murdered our Marines. How exactly is that going to be accomplished when hes still ordering our military to runaway and leave by this arbitrary Aug 31st deadline?! Our departure would render the closest base from which to launch a strike about 8 flying hours away!  The Aug 31st deadline is arbitrary. Please make no mistake about that. And now Biden has allowed it to become a Taliban red line?! Since when were these thugs allowed to decide American foreign policy?! Sticking to the 31st is akin to an unconditional surrender. We have 13 new gold star families in the homeland somewhere between 1000-4000 Americans still in theater and thousands more proven Afghan allies in harms way $85 billion in equipment left behind and Biden and his double down woke crew is still insisting on leaving in a few days.  Every military and intelligence advisor and expert agrees we CANNOT evacuate all of the Americans that want to leave by Aug 31st. Same with our allies. Cant do it.  A QUICK SIDE BAR ON BAGRAM AIR BASE  25 miles north of Kabul Airport where are troops are now and where the suicide attack today took place is Bagram Air Base. It was the largest base the US operated in Afghanistan. And we gave it up. Why? Because Joe Biden wouldnt allow for enough US forces present to keep it. So on July 1st 2021 without telling our Afghan allies the last remaining American forces slipped away under cover of night. 7 weeks later the Bagram fell to the Taliban.  History is watching. 20 years of trust has evaporated in 2 months. There are geopolitical implications as well and they reach far beyond Afghanistan. This debacle and Joe Bidens lack of leadership is playing directly into the narrative of the Chinese Communists in Beijing and in Putins Kremlin. They assert that America is a nation in decline and our power is waning. They tell anyone who will listen that the Americans show only weakness to their enemies and are treacherous to their friends. The last two months certainly hasnt assuaged our allies fears in this regard. What do you think our friends in Eastern Europe are thinking right now? Do you think many are sleeping easy tonight in Kiev? Or Lithuania? Or Poland? How about Kuwait? Would we have their backs now?! And there are most definitely millions on the island nation of Taiwan tossing and turning this very night.  Joe Biden proclaimed last month that this wouldnt be another Saigon. Well he was right. Its worse. 13 Americans are dead more wounded scores of the innocent slaughtered and chaos reigns. What should we do to gain some semblance of order sanity honor and standing?  Push the timeline back and declare we will leave when our mission is complete. That mission will be complete after we  1. Take back Bagram 2. Fly in Armor and a sufficient force to hold Bagram evacuate ALL remaining Americans & proven allies 3. Expand and then secure permitted around Kabul Airport 3. Smash ISIS-K and kill every last son of a bitch who planned/ordered/carried out murderous attack on our brave Marines 4. Retrieve sensitive equipment & weaponry and destroy any that cant be securely evacd out 5. If the Taliban resistance persists take back Kabul (by most accounts there are only 6000 Taliban holding the city) and expose them for the bullying thugs that they are.  Once our mission has been accomplished then and only then leave.  I call Nancy Pelosi to immediately bring the House back into session. We are a co-equal branch of government and we must demand answers from this administration. All members of Congress should be briefed on the current situation and all questions from members should be answered in a secure classified setting if necessary in full. Committees of jurisdiction namely Armed Services (of which Im a member) Intel Foreign Affairs and Homeland Security should immediately begin oversight hearings. We must get top Administration officials in front of Congress and hear their sworn testimony. We have to get answers so we can ensure that this never happens again. Ever.  Please join me in keeping our brave warriors in your thoughts hearts and prayers. They gave everything and we owe it to them to give our all to complete the mission. Rest In Peace Heroes.

Its been a hard week seeing what's happening in Afghanistan.  Like many of you all I watched videos from the Kabul airport and saw pictures of military planes full of people fleeing. Gut wrenching stuff.  I served in Afghanistan from 2005 to 2006.  At that point Al Qaeda in Afghanistan had been decimated and we were thoroughly into the nation-building part of the war.  I was stationed in a remote desert outpost north of Kandahar with a couple dozen soldiers. Poppies grew against the barricades of our little fort.  We had a company of Afghan soldiers that lived just outside our razor-wire fence in their own area. Part of our job involved training and running missions with them.  Wed do that a few times a week. Wed get into our Humvees with our weapons and head out to a very small village a few hours away.  Most of the missions were humanitarian. Coordinating construction for wells and schools (which we paid for). Veterinarian missions to de-worm goats and sheep. Handing out solar-powered radios (hugely popular went fast).  Our little group of American soldiers tried hard to build goodwill everywhere we went. We were always handing stuff out having tea with the local elders kicking soccer balls around with the kids.  We were attacked by the Taliban several times. Usually with rockets sometimes with small-arms fire. I remember once at night being outside and suddenly seeing small bright lights fly overhead and being confused for a second. Then the rockets started to land and I realized those small lights had been tracer rounds.  But IEDs were the biggest threat. We were constantly on the lookout for freshly turned dirt near the road and drove off-road as much as possible. I was usually the driver on our missions and I still remember what it felt like to drive across a narrow bridge or some other chokepoint where you knew an IED would be unavoidable if it detonated. We all just held our breath and I drove as fast as possible.  Soldiers were hurt and killed including a close friend of mine the week we were set to leave.  And then I boarded a helicopter and went home.  After I left I was never able to get a good sense of how things were actually going. We heard the same cautious optimism from our leaders for years but it was hard to read much into that. There was visible progress and visible failure. President George Bush used to talk about an Afghanistan that could govern and defend itself. How close were we? How many more years would it take?  And now we know. Despite a massive effort we never even came close.  Trumps deal with the Taliban in 2018 created certainty that we would in fact be leaving. As a result the Taliban largely stopped attacking our troops. They were waiting.  We proceeded with our exit because we had already given Afghanistan everything we could. We poured $90 billion into the Afghan military and stayed for an entire generation - at a loss of nearly 2500 American servicemembers.  The Afghan army numbered close to 300000 at least on paper. They had certainly shown a willingness to fight having already lost 66000 soldiers in the last 20 years.  Afghanistan has 34 provinces. On August 6th the Taliban captured their first provincial capital. This wasnt a huge shock because the province was nestled between Iran and Pakistan farther from the national capital of Kabul than any other province. It was the lowest-hanging piece of fruit for the Taliban. That said it was taken with virtually no resistance which in retrospect was a sign of things to come.  In the next two days the Taliban captured four more provincial capitals.  In the next five days another 10 provincial capitals fell.  In the next three days it was over. The national capital of Kabul fell the president fled.  Thats nine days from the first province to the rest.  While a sizable number of elite Afghan soldiers put up a fight - and may now be regrouping in the Panjshir Valley north of Kabul - what we saw from the army regulars was near-instant capitulation. The bulk of the Afghan army wasnt defeated - it evaporated.  Its hard to put ourselves in the shoes of those Afghan soldiers and to understand their calculations - but it isnt hard to see what their ultimate decision was and that was essentially to walk off the battlefield en masse.  Now the mission is evacuation. Americans still in Afghanistan interpreters and their families and others who are at extreme risk - like 250 female judges who were still serving until this week - must be flown out of the country immediately.  Here are three major mistakes that have hindered the evacuation mission:  The first was the previous administrations decision to sharply reduce the processing of Special Immigrant Visas. Thats a program that was created specifically for Afghans and Iraqis who helped us and its supposed to be an expedited process to get them safely out of the country. It involves an administrative review that is arduous and bureaucratic even when its functioning - but Trump blocked almost all requests.  When Biden took over the wait-list had 17000 Afghans on it. That wasnt an oversight that was Trump lumping these people in with his broader anti-immigration message and not caring about the consequences. (Incidentally after seeing recent events he put out a statement saying that Afghans who assisted the U.S. should be allowed to seek refuge.)  That said fixing the SIV process should have been a much higher priority for the current administration. That was our second mistake. Yes the evaporation of the Afghan army was a shock. But we plan for unlikely contingencies all the time. That should have been one. There was no reason not to expedite the process by bringing the applicants to a U.S. territory like Guam and allowing the rest of the application process to occur there. Thats exactly what we did in 1975 when we left Vietnam. The governor of Guam even indicated that the island was prepared to accept them.  That should have happened back in April but it absolutely should have happened once we saw the Taliban making swift gains across the country in early July. Weve hit the gas on the process now and were evacuating several thousand people per day. Thats progress but it shows we could have sped things up much sooner.  Third we should not have given away the Bagram airfield before the evacuation mission was complete. If we were going to need to conduct a rapid large-scale evacuation we were going to need Bagram which was our largest base and the most fortified airfield. We left it in early July and now we have to rely on the airport in Kabul to conduct evacuation operations. Its much harder to defend and more limited in terms of air traffic given that it only has one runway while the airfield at Bagram has two.  Now we have no choice but to conduct our evacuation mission under extreme pressure. Thats a bad situation to be in and a tough mission but its a mission that we have an obligation to carry out. We dont get to call it a day and walk away from these people who helped us many of whom will surely die if we dont make the decision to save them.  We owe them as a nation - but I owe them personally. Every time we ran a mission I was putting my life in the hands of my interpreter. Our interpreter was at greater risk than any of us because the Taliban knew that if you take out the interpreter it makes the whole unit ineffective.  And he never ever let me down. Every mission every moment he was always by my side. I moved he moved. When we were in a village and a group of men suddenly started walking towards our team he would step forward and start speaking as quickly and calmly as he could. And this is the guy were going to cut loose? Unacceptable.  The same goes for that interpreters family. My interpreters wife and children became targets as soon as he ran his first mission with us. They took that risk together as a family so our obligation extends to them as a family.  Getting those folks out is the right thing to do but its also in our national interest. If we dont get them out whats going to happen the next time we need to ask locals in a foreign country to help us? How are those locals going to look at our soldiers when we ask them to trust us?  And to the 16 House Republicans who voted against the bill to speed up the visa applications there is no possible defense for that. To do that deliberately - knowing what it could lead to for those who helped us - is unconscionable.  We're already hearing some generic anti-refugee sentiment from some of these folks. I'd remind them of our history with respect to Vietnam.  After we left Vietnam we had a policy geared specifically to Vietnamese refugees. We helped people who otherwise would have been killed.  We don't regret that decision - we're proud of it.  One of those people who we saved became my next-door neighbor when I was a kid. He was a former officer for the South Vietnamese Army - who probably would have been killed if he hadnt gotten out - and by some amazing act of grace he and his wife landed in Chapel Hill North Carolina.  His son became one of my best friends. We grew up together. I never fully appreciated his familys story until I was in college. He had the opportunity to live a wonderful life because our country decided to keep its commitments to those who had fought with us.  As it turns out we couldnt bring democracy to Afghanistan - but we can decide to keep our commitments to those who fought for it with us.  That is now the mission and we must not fail.  - Jeff Jackson,political,Facebook
The United States has spent TRILLIONS to support Afghanistans incompetent government and military. Im not just saying this they are literally incompetent.

There have been some questions posed to other candidates on Critical Race Theory. Their response has been that it isn't in Lansing. Do you want to elect a Board Member who is only looking at the present situation and not the future? We are running for a 4-year term. Voters have a right to know how candidates stand and will vote on any current or potential issue coming to the board in the next 4 years. The Biden administration has already put forth efforts to tie additional school funding to the implantation of Critical Race Theory. Our Attorney General is joining other states to keep this from happening. Our Kansas legislature is introducing a bill to keep CRT out of our schools. They are being proactive as I will be as Lansing School Board member. If these fail it will come down to the local school boards. Other districts in Kansas have already adopted CRT as part of their curriculum and wcB mission statement.  We have seen over this last year with the Covid closures masking online learning how much your local elections affect your daily life. We need candidates that listen to parents. Some of the incumbents running for re-election did vote for hybrid schedules instead of returning 5 days in school which is what surveyed parents wanted. Over 80 percent wanted their kids in school 5 days. They voted for mask mandates which parents did not want.

Good morning everybody! As the deadline for Congressional re-districting closes in this page will be more active to educate our fans about projections to the House and Senate ratings for next years primaries. We know that Texas will have 40 electoral votes (yes FOURTY!) which means two new Congressional districts added to Texas. The seats we see flipping in TX based on Biden's approval rating and his handling of immigration issues are:  TX-15 (Central Hidalgo to Guadalupe county) TX-34 (Southeast Hidalgo to Dewitt county) TX-7 (West Houston and suburbs like River Oaks and Memorial) The GOP needs 4 seats to re-take the house and TX could be key.  Were going to begin talking about the Virginia and New Jersey Governors races. Can a Trump Republican in those states manage to lead a strong coalition to victory or will it take a more moderate candidate to reach across the aisle to connect enough voters? Also we will being running regression models according to Census models to predict voting behaviors and demographic changes. Stay tuned as we follow up with the news!!,political,Facebook

Despite the tragic realities of Biden's self-made crisis his administration is lying to the American people ignoring recommendations from senior leaders on the ground releasing thousands of unvetted migrants into the country and terminating the highly-effective Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP).

Read my full op-ed on the Administration's plans to pay illegal immigrants $450000:  Prices are rising across the board for American families. A tarnished global reputation after a botched Afghanistan withdrawal. Supply chain issues causing shipping delays and shortages. And a border crisis of epic proportions.  Americans face these mounting crises because of the Biden administrations radical agenda and irresponsible policies that put America last.  I was disturbed but frankly unsurprised to learn that the administration has a plan in the works to pay individuals who tried to enter our country illegally $450000  each. When all is said and done if this plan moves forward the Administration could spend almost $1 billion on these payouts.  That money isnt coming out of thin air  working families in Iowa will be funding this cash prize for those who knowingly violated our laws.  To put this in perspective the average family in Iowa brings home around $78000 a year. The Administration wants to pay individuals who broke our laws more than four times that  that is just plain wrong. Its unfair to Americans who work hard for their money and want to see it spent wisely.  Its offensive to the many immigrants who pursued our nations legal immigration process waited their turn in line and are now living in our country legally  and paying their taxes.  And just think about the message that this would send to those considering trying to subvert our laws and cross our border right now. Currently over 3000 migrants have formed a caravan with the intent of storming our border overwhelming law enforcement on the ground and coming into our country illegally.  The Administrations open border policies are incentivizing this surge of illegal immigration. If this payout plan moves forward it will be a clear message that breaking our immigration laws will not only be tolerated but also be rewarded.  There are no circumstances in which Iowan and American families should fund these payouts to illegal immigrants  but this proposal is even more egregious amid the Biden Administrations self-made border crisis. A crisis they still refuse to acknowledge. For the last four months in a row there have been more migrants apprehended at the border than the entire population of Cedar Rapids Iowa.  But instead of returning to policies that secured our border  building the wall reinstating the Remain in Mexico Policy and ensuring Border Patrol Agents have necessary resources to protect us  the Administration is focused on giving $450000 to some illegal immigrants.  I am ready to get to work on policies that incentivize legal immigration while stopping illegal immigration  including modernizing our visa waiver program and reducing processing backlogs  but we wont be able to have serious conversations about reforming our legal immigration system if this is the type of policy the Administration is intent on prioritizing.  This is the wrong policy at the wrong time and Ill do everything I can to ensure Americans hard-earned money isnt used to reward those who tried to enter our country illegally.,political,Facebook

Russian SVR Espionage / Nasdaq Stock - Net Element NETE Securities & Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler Chairman 100 F Street NE Washington DC 20549  Federal Bureau of Investigation Christopher Wray 935 Pennsylvania Ave NW Washington DC 20535  There is a current ongoing Russian threat to American national security that has burrowed into the very heart of our economic system. Americans need to know that the Russian foreign intelligence service SVR (the spy agency and successor to the KBG) is penetrating and jeopardizing our economic system through a Nasdaq shell company called Net Element.  Tactical Rabbit a Pennsylvania-based private intelligence agency uncovered this through our network of former CIA FBI Secret Service and military intelligence specialists who operate worldwide. Tactical Rabbit has launched HUMINT (interpersonal human intelligence) operations against specific SVR-related targets. Our findings revealed that Vladimir Putin is directly involved in Net Element. CEO Oleg Firer an ambassador to Grenada was directly given his diplomatic cover by Putin himself. Net Element was launched with the mission to spy on Americans and to penetrate the U.S. economic system.  Putin believed it was critical for a diplomat to head Net Element to provide a high level of cover and immunity from U.S. Law Enforcement agencies. Firer also has direct connections to at least three groups of Russian organized crime as well as the Russian SVR. Russian intelligence controls him and he is their asset.  I Everett Stern founder of Tactical Rabbit filed a SEC whistleblower claim against Net Element and the SEC has responded in kind. I am drafting this public letter to ensure the SEC follows through on eliminating a deadly threat from our economic system.  It is our hope that the FBI raids the Miami headquarters of Net Element and takes any Russian operatives into custody. I provided a full intelligence report conducted by Tactical Rabbit to the FBI CIA SEC and the Treasury Department.  Both the Russian GRU and SVR intelligence services plan to use Firer and Net Element as agents of influence within the U.S. -- covertly influencing U.S. public opinion and U.S. policymakers -- and to acquire restricted U.S. technology. They can also provide legitimate commercial cover to Russian intelligence officers operating inside the U.S. to help spot and assess potential U.S. citizens of operational interest and to covertly move and transfer large amounts of money in and out of the U.S. to fund Russian intelligence operations.  Through their association with a high-profile and wealthy Russian businessman Firer and Net Element have developed business ties and associations which have possibly allowed them to clandestinely acquire restricted dual-use (civilian and military) U.S. technology in the battery and electric vehicle sectors for passage to Russia.  All the money Net Element makes keeps going back to Moscow. But whats important is the technology. Its also taking American citizens information and sending it back to Moscow.  Everett A.

PRO-LIFE ALERT--The Hyde Amendment protects life by ensuring that no federal taxpayer dollars are used to fund abortions. Joe Biden has removed the Hyde Amendment from his budget and House Democrats in Washington just advanced a spending bill without Hyde Amendment protections.

Without the Hyde Amendment today South Dakota would likely be forced to provide taxpayer funded abortions under Medicaid or be kicked off the federal Medicaid program entirely.

A BLOW FOR IMMIGRATION AND GOVERNMENTAL REFORM  A federal District Court in Houston has struck down the Obama Administrations Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and its companion for parents of those children. Specifically it held that the program was an administrative rule making required to follow the notice and comment process of the federal Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The failure of the Obama Administration to follow this process rendered the program illegal. CNN helpfully included a copy of the Order and Opinion of the court here. The decision is not only a step towards effective immigration reform but also strikes a blow against the power of the administrative state.  The court essentially took up the issues ignored in the US Supreme Courts Regents of the University of California opinion previously discussed here. This decision struck down the attempted rescission of the DACA program by the Trump Administration as itself violating the APA while glossing over the illegalities in the original rulemaking. This new federal court opinion turns the tables and focuses on those infirmities noting that the Supreme Court itself held that DACA was not simply a passive non- enforcement policy. Instead it conferred affirmative immigration relief such as the right to receive a work permit and the right to travel abroad without permission. It did so despite admitting in the original memorandum that only the Congress could confer affirmative immigration relief. The district courts opinion built on Justice Clarence Thomass dissent in the Regents opinion by highlighting the real reason for the program  the inability of successive Presidents to unite the Congress and country around an immigration bill that included effective limits and enforcement as well as the necessary relief for longtime residents.  The district court was mindful of the hardships an immediate cessation of the program would cause to current participants and simply prohibited further expansion of the program for the time being. The Biden Administration has announced that it will appeal the order and urged Congress to pass a bill fixing the problem. The administrations latter position is correct. Both political parties need to look beyond the twin corruptions of identity politics and corporate contributions to pass a comprehensive immigration reform legalizing the status of the Dreamers and creating real enforceable limits on future immigration as I advocated in this post. A truly comprehensive answer to the immigration crisis would be a new beginning for insuring the American Dream for both lifetime citizens and immigrants alike.

PROTECTING AMERICA AND ITS WORKERS  [With] the recent discoveries of physicians and neurologists engineers and economists the public can formulate minimum occupational standards below which demonstrably work can be prosecuted only at a human deficit. [We] hold that all industrial conditions which fall below such standards should come within the scope of governmental action and controlled in the same way that subnormal sanitary conditions are subject to public regulation and for the same reason - because they threaten the general welfare.  Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Nomination Acceptance Speech at Progressive Party Convention August 6 1912  Hospitals at crisis care levels. Children increasingly infected and hospitalized by the new Delta COVID-19 variant. States forcing businesses to assume the risk of employee and customer infections due to masking prohibitions.  President Bidens vaccination plan attempts to address these new threats from the coronavirus pandemic. Americans are understandably weary of all of the restrictions and frustrated by the failure of our federal and state governments to develop a clear path out of them. The way to examine the necessity of the plan is to ask three questions:  1. Is it a good idea? 2. Is it legal? 3. Is there a better way to do it?  Is it a good idea?  As I said in my post Wasting Americas Moment the vaccination program is an effective and uniquely American response to the pandemic. Vaccinations significantly reduce the likelihood of hospitalization and eliminate the risk of death not only for recipients but also potentially for the unvaccinated. They are also our best way to achieve a return to normality in life by allowing business and government to reopen by lessening their liability for workers compensation and customer liability. The toll on our children should also concern us and supports a masking mandate in at least elementary schools.  Is it legal?  The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1974 grants the Federal government the power to regulate workplace safety to reduce workplace hazards including illnesses. This law has existed for over three decades and its legality has repeatedly been upheld. In particular section 6 (c)(1) gives the President through the Department of Labor Occupational Safety the right to issue Emergency Temporary Standards (ETS) when employees are exposed to grave danger from exposure to substances or agents determined to be toxic or physically harmful or from new hazards and (B) that such emergency standard is necessary to protect employees from such danger. 29 U.S.C.  655(c)(1). This cannot be done by mere executive order. The proposed ETS must be reviewed by an advisory committee drafted and then published in the Federal Register. While it becomes immediately effective at upon publication it expires after six months if not renewed through the usual notice and comment procedure under the federal Administrative Procedure Act. See this description of the process on OSHAs website  Thus it will be at least a week before any rule or mandate is adopted. Based on the statement from the White House the rule will allow employees to escape the vaccination requirements through weekly negative COVID-19 testing. Many other issues will need to be addressed and the President has met with business and labor leaders to begin to resolve them. They will also be hashed out by the advisory committee.  Is there a better way do it?  The new emergency standard is unique since it will apply not just to certain industries but to to almost every type of workplace in the nation. Imposing a mandate of this breadth should be the province of the Congress not an administrative agency. Acting through legislation instead of an OSHA rulemakings would have allowed the administration to include measures that are outside of the agencys power such as providing federal financial support for the small number of employees who may suffer adverse reactions to the vaccine. Even more importantly it would have forced Republicans and Democrats in Congress to confront the issues both specious and valid about our pandemic response. Such a debate would have exposed the weaknesses in both the anti-vaxxer and permanent lockdown camps which may be why both sides want to avoid it. However The eventual result would not fully satisfy the Dr. Anthony Faucis or Rep. Marjorie Greens of the world but it might satisfy the average American trying to run his or her life in a responsible and caring manner.  Nevertheless we appear to be stuck with the OSHA emergency standard as the only likely method of spurring vaccinations and stopping the surge in the current Delta variant of COVID-19. If opponents want to be helpful they will start demanding that the Biden Administration set a clear metric for when vaccination and masking mandates will end. What number they pick - whether it is cases hospitalization rates or death rates - matters less than the simple courageous act of making a decision and setting a goal for the American people to rally around. Only then will we move beyond irresponsible political rhetoric and see the light at the end of this dark tunnel.  Please visit the website version of this post to see the referenced links.

I served as an infantry soldier in Iraq not Afghanistan but the events of the past 2 weeks have brought to mind a great many thoughts. So to share just a few:  1. Like a great many other veterans Ive generally supported drawing down our presence in Afghanistan. But that was predicated on the assumption that (a) we would certainly give the Afghani army and government every opportunity to defend themselves (b) that we would offer sanctuary to every Afghani who has worked with us and obviously that (c) we would bring every American home safely before withdrawing the military. It is a shameful embarrassment that President Biden failed to do any of the 3.  2. Most of the toughest memories I have from Iraq involve kids. The footage of kids being lifted over the wall as parents willingly give them up to protect them is gut-wrenching.  3. The military is incredibly effective at large-scale offensive operations. For example the entirety of Iraq was taken under our control in 19 days. We could certainly take back control of enough of Kabul and/or Bagram Air Base to enable us to rescue the *thousands* of Americans now behind enemy lines. Its just a matter of will - unfortunately I dont believe President Biden has any.  4. When I came home and the Iraq War was going poorly afterwards some people asked me Was it worth it? Veterans have a wide range of opinion on this but I can only speak for myself. I personally believed in the mission I was on but deep down I stepped forward to serve because its what my country asked of me at the time. Every single war America has ever fought has at one time or another been controversial. We will always question Was it worth it? and people will always come to different conclusions. And so I encourage veterans not to view your service through the lens of politics and what one president or general later does or does not do. What matters is that you stepped up to serve when called and the manner in which you served once you arrived. Thats all you can control - and that is enough.,political,Facebook

Did you know? For those new to our club or its social media page-a brief history of what we DO. But first our story. In 2002 a handful of activists including Debby Kerner Sheila Blake and Alan Guttman got together and- tired of a red shaded community and county- formed Southwest Houston Democrats. Shortly after having found a need for a deeper community focus  they named it Meyerland Area Democrats with Meyerland Westbury Maplewood and Marilyn Estates. And so it began...  It grew as more and more joined and starting inviting speakers and learning how to do GOTV operations in these communities. Neighbor by neighbor grassroots activism at its finest rose. The club became known for being fierce fighters for progressives. A generation of leadership was trained in our club. The club has outgrown every space its occupied from Marco's to Escalante's to Fadi's and now Zoom/Facebook live.  Meyerland Area Democrats besides having stellar programming which has brought in the movers and shakers in the Democratic party from not just Houston but Texas and even nationally has contributed in key ways via its organizing.  Our members in the past 3 cycles alone have made some 75000 calls to voters knocked on the doors of over 25000 homes written 50000 postcards raised thousands for the Harris County Democratic Party the Texas Democratic Party Annie's List TOP and has given to numerous local party clubs.  We are proud to say that the communities we serve have had their voter turnout rise to the top 1 percentile in turnout countywide and our goal of turning these neighborhoods blue has succeeded. When President Pronin was sworn in for his 1st term in 2011 John Culberson was the congressman for much of our membership and community. Today it is Democrat Lizzie Fletcher. HD 134 voted Republican the entire ballot 10 years ago. Today HD134 is voting Democratic- by 30 points for Biden-and now has a Democratic State Rep. Ann Johnson.  Our new Democratic congresswoman Lizzie Fletcher-took her rise in the forum we hosted in January 2017. Many new activists post Trump's election came to our club to get connected- and grew networks into Swing Left and others who won the race. Without Meyerland Area Democrats having organized these communities for years such a victory would have been even more difficult.  Also to note-in 2015 our club was key in Mayor Turner's win- in a race won by 4000 votes. We even got an office from Turner in Westbury. We staged numerous canvass events created and funded mailers and much more. We were front and center in that key fight.  Some other highlights include hosting Beto O'Rourke twice the second townhall we did at Westbury High School with 1600 guests is the largest gathering of progressives in the history of Westbury! Other programming highlights include: James Carville Mayors Turner Parker and Lee Brown. We are also proud of tackling complex issues and pressing for conversations in the community- ie Black Lives Matter GLBT rights public education teachins on various issues . We have partnered with many of our county clubs including Swing Left HBAD ROAD Women TDW Harris Houston Young Stonewall Dems Harris County Young Democrats Bayou Blue Dems Bellaire-Braes Democrats  Sharpstown Democrats (and many more). Call us forum gurus- as our forums have set the standard for fairness and attendance.  To the thousands of you who have through our club over the years thank you. The work of our membership as it is in all our clubs is that of great personal sacrifice. 17 years in and our organization has become one which is seen as one of our state's premiere organizations for the party. We also happen to represent the largest number of Jewish American Democrats of any local club in the state!  See you soon (on Zoom)- Art Pronin President,political,Facebook

TIME TO PREACH  First of all I am not a preachernot ordainedand not licensed! I am a follower of Christ and want to share what is on my heart. So lets call this a fifteen-minute sermonmaybe a little longer--dont hang up on me now. Maybe this will helpyou will not have to listen to a choir or praise teamno announcementsand more importantno offering!  You will not hear this type of sermon proclaimed from the pulpits of most churches in Americaonly a few.  Lets get serious and dig in. Folkswhat is going on in the world todayit is scary. What I want to share affects the whole worldbut I want to concentrate on Americathe good ole U.S.A.  To set the tone let me mention a number of news headlines we hear today.  Hot items: critical race theory; cancel culture; defund the police; Southern border crisis; wokism; socialism and Marxism; Green New Deal and climate change; big tech censorship and social media platforms; Wuhan lab leak CCP seeks to control America; and the Great Reset.  And a few recent headlines: Antifa BLM and White supremacists; suicide rate rises; 2020 election fraud; assault on Constitution and Bill of Rights; abortions cryptocurrencies LBGTQ; Biden and Harris Administration; Covid 19 vaccines and mandates; and the U.S. debt approaching $30 trillion.  Why all the liescorruptionlawlessnessself-interestpower struggleschasing the almighty dollarinjustice. Where are we heading as a nation? I am not an alarmistbut a realist. So lets look at Gods Word for an understanding.  May I be bold and bluntwhy this mess? Bottom lineit is Satan.  Lets reviewGod created Lucifera high and mighty angela cherubim. God created Lucifer and millions of angels prior to creating the earth. (Job 38:4-7) (Ezekiel 28:12-19)  Lucifer then sinned by attempting to become God and was filled with pride. (Isa 14:12-14 Ezekiel 28:15-17)  God pushed Lucifer and one-third of the angels from the Heaven of Heavens. (Luke 10:18 Revelation 12:49)  Lucifer became known as Satantempted Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. (Genesis 3:13)  Adam and Eve fell and sinned against Godas a result all mankind is born with a sin nature.  By the waySatan is alive and well today. Did you know that Satan still has restricted access to the heavenly realm? God has given Satan limited powers todayand it is temporary (Romans 16:20). 1 John 5:19 tells us that the whole world is under the control of the evil one the fallen angels and the demons.  Satan is gradually setting up a one world governmenthe has a controlled agenda. And most important to himhe is doing all he can to thwart Gods redemptive plan. And he is working overtime because he knows his time is short and coming to an end.  Lets now look at AmericaI believe we are a post Christian nation. We have thrown God out. Want proofhere is a partial list: remove prayer in public schools in 1962; remove Bible reading in public schools in 1963; abortion legalized in 1973; remove Ten Commandments from classroom in 1980; struck down sodomy law in 2003; ruled DOMA unconstitutional in 2013; and approved same sex marriages in 2015.  Satan has infiltrated the Halls of Congress The White House the Supreme Court schools and universities churches Hollywood the media and yesour homes.  Let me share some highlights of the Ninevah and Jerusalem principle written by Bill Salus in June 2016. This talks about Americas spiritual condition.  First the Ninevah experiencea story of hope found in Jeremiah 18:7-8 If at any time I announce that a nation or kingdom is to be uprooted torn down or destroyed and that nation I warned repents of its evil then I will relent and not inflict on it the disaster I had planned. God sent Jonah to warn the people of its impending destruction. The people of Ninevah turned from evil waysthe resultGod saw their works and relented from bringing disaster upon them (Jonah 3:410).  And the Jerusalem experiencea story of despair found in Jeremiah 18:9-10 And if at another time I announce that a nation or kingdom is to be built up or planted and if it does evil in my sight and does not obey me then I will reconsider the good I had intended to do for it. The nation of Judah reached a point of no return and the Lord determined that its destruction would not be postponed. In fact God told Jeremiah to stop praying for the people of Judah three times. The people of Judah forsook their God JehovahJeremiah 19:4-9 provides the indictment.  The Lord has provided ample warnings to America that the country is headed for destruction. When will God judge America? Is it happening now? What does your heart of hearts tell you?  Does America have a national repentance forthcoming? If yes America must resemble forgiven Ninevah. If no the Lord will no longer bless this nation and Americas greatness will never return. Only God knows Americas final verdict.  Lets turn our attention to mankind now. What about each of us as individualswe are born into sinwe each have a sinful nature within us.  What does the Bible say about mankind? Romans 3:10 says There is none righteous not even one. Romans 3:23 says All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.  Take this to the bankGod wants all mankind to be saved. Romans 10:13 says Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.  God has provided a means for salvationJesus died on the cross to pay for our sins. We must confess our sins and accept Jesus as Lord and Savior. Ephesians 2:8-9 says For it is by grace you have been saved through faithand this is not from yourselves it is the gift of Godnot by works so that no one can boast.  If you accept Jesus God then sends the Holy Spirit to live within your heart. Have you done that? You become a new personyou have the power of the Holy Spirit within you. By the way the Holy Spirit will communicate with your spirit and let you know you are saved. And this is very important to rememberSatan has no authority over those who are in Christ but has domain over unbelievers.  I have made a recent study and believe that less than ten percent of the worlds population including America will go to Heaven. In fact in a recent Barna poll it was found that only six percent of Christians hold to a biblical worldview.  Will there be a revival in America? My answer--I believe not prior to the seven-year Tribulation. During the Tribulation there will be one last huge revival with millions accepting Jesus refer to Revelation 6:9-11 and Revelation 20:4.  As we Christians wait patiently for the Rapture what are we to do today? We must share Christ with others churches must preach the Gospel and we must love one another as John 13:34 states A new command I give you love one another as I have loved you so you must love one another.  Very importantand dont forget--in the end God wins! Satan and all unbelievers will be thrown into the Lake of Fire for eternity.  Lets end by quoting John 3:16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. Is the Holy Spirit speaking to you? Please accept Jesus! Amen.,political,Facebook

I want to talk a little bit about election security and Voter Id. More dangerous ground as what I am about to say is likely to annoy both sides. First of all I do not think President Trump lost the last election due to voter fraud. I think his behavior (not his policies) just alienated too many independent voters he needed to repeat his win from 2016. I have researched and researched for any sign of proof of enough fraud to affect this election and have not found any. Add to that Sydney Powells claim that no one would reasonably believe her claim of voting machine fraud that it was only political speech and I just do not see any proof. I am not from Missouri but am very much a show me kind of guy. I want to see the proof and make my own decisions over people telling me what to believe.  Secondly the potential for fraud and abuse in our elections are very much real and we need to be proactive to address it and yes one of these actions means voter IDs. If anything this last election has shown how vulnerable our election system is to doubt being created. These are things that our adversaries will use in the future through misinformation campaigns and psychological operations to create doubt in our constitutional republic system of democracy and to further divide Americans. If we are too busy fighting ourselves we cannot take care of ourselves and our country.  For whatever reason close to half of the country has lost faith in the security of our election system I think restoring that faith is well worth the cost and should be treated like any other threat to our nation.  With all of this being said I do not see either the Republicans or the Democrats being serious about fixing this issue they are both using it to their advantage at the expense of our country. I base this on a simple observation.  From the Republican side if they were really concerned about voter IDs they would take the democratic claim of disenfranchisement and address it. Any security measure we take will cost money. If the Government will require an ID to secure an election then the Government should pay for it and provide it once. If a ID is stolen it could be replaced with a police report to show it was actually stolen. Grants can be established to help pay to get the required documentation (or we could just make it simple with a $100 credit per dependent on next years taxes). Lets say the total cost would average $100 per person. With somewhere over 330 million people you would be looking at $33 billion dollars. Sorry world securing our elections is more important then your aid packages (2019 we sent over $39 billion in foreign aid). For most of us that already have a government issued ID the cost would be much lower than $100.  From the Democrat side they have long had the practice of throwing money at any little problem if they were truly worried about disenfranchisement they would have come up with my recommendation above a long time ago and told the Republicans to put their money where their mouth is. With the mammoth infrastructure bill President Biden is pushing you really think they would not have found $33 billion to put in there if this were a real concern of theirs?  Election security is just another issue the establishments are using to fire up their bases at the potential risk to our country. Voter IDs are just one piece of the picture when it comes to election security but it seems to be the one everyone is talking about.  I will leave you with one last set of figures. $33 billion for Voter Ids or $10 billion to Jeff Bezos so he can get awarded a contract he actually lost? You decide American Voter Security or Corporate welfare.,political,Facebook
The 13 Republicans who helped Pelosi pass a 1.2 trillion so called  infrastructure bill should be ashamed of themselves. These people know nothing about the evil ways of the  New Democrat party and its leaders. They never fight back for the benefit of their constituents or the American people. These massive expenditure are nothing but pork bribes and handouts to companies controlled by the democrats. It has little to do with so called bridges and roads & other infrastructure. These monies will fall into the hands of corrupt cronies of the democrats and for many more wasteful  projects. God knows how much will end up in secret slush funds for the democrats to bribe their way through for more power ! Biden now says that those who came illegally & got separated from their children should be massively compensated ! There seems to be no end to the corrupt ways of this administration & its democrat party. No immigrant would have been separated from any child or any family member if they had tried to come legally ! Shame shame shame ! How about massive compensation for the soldiers that got killed in Afghanistan & other foreign lands ! There is a war against US citizens in favor of foreigners who might vote democrat ! Its strictly about keeping power without merit or proper leadership ! Shame shame shame !,political,Facebook

Oh God the degree of incompetence of Joe Biden is mind boggling. He really thinks that there was no way to get out of Kabul without the chaos and the disaster he created. The Vice President has disappeared and general Milley head of the army seems angry at Americans expecting a better exit strategy !!! It seems that incompetence ineptness unprofessionalism & pure stupidity trickles down from Biden to his VP to the Secretary of State the Pentagon the Intelligence Services and Homeland security and the NSA & some of the army chiefs. That is what you get when you select people strictly based on everything including race & gender & ethnicity but not based on merit & experience and intelligence and capabilitiy. The media should be destroyed for their role in all of this. Biden should be impeached and the people need to rise up and unite to end this obvious destruction of their country. The Chinese could not have wished for a more incapable and incompetent and mentally challenged & clueless person to have to deal with regarding the U.S. ! The Taliban got a complete free pass after 20 years of American sacrifice of blood tears loss of life and money. Now those Chinese will own Afghanistan and its natural wealth & resources and be heroes because they know how to govern to their benefit with astute & wise leaders.

NOT SIMPLY IRONIC TWISTS OF HISTORY  When Jimmy Carter was President the economic situation was dark four long years. When Carter lost reelection to Ronald Reagan within 100 days of Regans leadership as President the circumstances were getting brighter with each passing day.  When Donald Trump was President the economic situation was bright four long years. When Trump lost reelection to Joe Biden within 100 days of Bidens leadership as President the circumstances have been getting darker with each passing day.  These might seem like ironic twists of history but they arent. They are clear evidence that one approach to leadership and understanding of economic policy works while the other doesnt.

"Dumb Joe Biden quote from a speech on May 28 regarding Chinese aspirations......  ""America is unique. Of all the nations in the world we are the only nation organized based on an idea.""  Umm.... Our ideology which is based on an idea is not unique.  Our country was not based on an idea but on a political concept based on history. A Republic our form of government was not unique to the USA. Freedom from Great Britain was not an idea but a result of financial abuse by its colonial masters.  Marxist ideology is based on an idea written by Karl Marx. National Socialism was based on an idea written by Adolph Hitler.  So Biden was trying to illustrate how we are different than China. Chinese nationalism was born out of their country being held by many colonial masters along its coast line. Its roots in rebellion was the Boxer Rebellion in the early 20th century. Nationalism grew under Chiang Kai-shek and the Koumintang. A counter movement under Mao Tse Tung with Marxism as a basis for revolution evolved around the same time. Both sides were grown out of an idea or ideology. One prevailed and took China over. One fled to Taiwan.  So Uncle Joe is either ill informed or just saying stupid stuff for an audience of minions. Either way Xi Jinping has stated he will own the USA by 2035 based on HIS idea and ideology.

Trump was a terrible dictator and Biden is a bad one too because he is a puppet of dictators. Nancy on the other hand selfish conceited self absorbed & extremely egoistic. She uses her powers even though limited to the maximum without any morals or reservations or regard of the law. A good dictator makes the rules and the law and Nancy is a master at that. She places people who agree with her and her methods in positions of power and those that disagree with her are swept away. She holds secret hearings and sets the agenda for almost anything and pushes hoaxes and propaganda all in her own favor. As dictator she impeached an innocent president she did not like twice She even controls the press and the MSM and big tech social media. She is good at it !

"The crime rate is rapidly rising.Blue run states are defunding their police and the rest of the police forces are resigning in droves.They have been vilified & discouraged to the point where they would rather not be part of the police & part of law & order. Those who commit crimes are let free even when captured to repeat criminal activities all over again.The real criminals are given a free pass while the democrats are creating the fear of a non existent ""white supremacist'""fear. It has all bee planned from almost 4 plus years ago & is leading to the destruction of this country. All this is done with the goal of the socialist fascist democrats to keep power. It is not about America common sense nor law & order nor justice. It is all about power. There is no civilized society without a police force. They are now trying to weaponize and politicize the armed forces. It was embarrassing to watch & listen to Mark A. Milley Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff the other day. He is the highest ranking military officer. Biden has held office for almost 50 years and his party has controlled government as long or longer. Why has this been allowed to exist if it is as bad as they say it is. Obama was President for 8 years and Biden his VP for those 8 years. Why all of a sudden this cancel culture Critical race theory racism and the appearance of so much white supremacy. Did the democrats just realize this ? No this is all made up to change the country once & for all for something that has been tried and failed every time in history & wherever it was tried. Innocent people are being harassed and intimidated while the criminals and the guilty are being let free. Guns are not killers but instruments to kill in the wrong criminal hands.Cars are for transportation but can also be used to kill just like steak knives and box cutters. If this country wanted to select or elect anyone to destroy it including the strongest most powerful countries in the world they would not have done as good a job as this mad man and his VP. God help America and give its people the courage & unity to stop the destruction of the republic. Little more of this insanity & there will be nothing worth saving !",political,Facebook
I am angered and heartbroken by what has happened in Afghanistan. The Biden Administration's lack of planning and complete mismanagement throughout this withdrawal process has now led to the deaths of at least twelve United States servicemembers.  This is totally unacceptable. I will do my job representing the people of Kansas Second Congressional District by holding the Biden Administration accountable for this disaster. We must make it abundantly clear to the Taliban ISIS and all other extremist groups that any attacks on American citizens in Afghanistan will be met with the full force of the United States military.  Suzanne and I are praying for our servicemen and women American citizens and our allies on the ground in Kabul.  It didnt have to be this way.,political,Facebook
Do you think the Chinese screwed up with Biden in office? All those products sitting on ships anchored and waiting days and days to be unloaded. Hard to get paid when you cant deliver the goods. Maybe people going back to work and unloading products would be better. Even better would be the products being made here so they werent stuck on ships.  Lets go Brandon!!!!,political,Facebook

Here is a different way to look at the current surge of illegal immigration. There are two very different groups coming with very different motivations. The first group of illegal border crossers are the traditional ones we are most familiar with. They are primarily men crossing secretly with the intent to slip into American society and work jobs that unscrupulous employers offer them so they can either send money back to their families they left behind or support their families that joined them on their underground journey. The other group are the ones trying to take advantage of international asylum laws that grant refugees the right to stay in a receiving country while their case is heard. A subset of this group are children that are abandoned at the border by their parents hoping that doing so would give their children a better chance of staying in our country legally and having a better life than they could have in their home country. I compare the overall illegal immigration situation to a drug epidemic. The people coming across are desperately seeking something that would make them feel better about their lives and they are being fed promises by criminal groups that are making huge profits in facilitating their journeys. Just like drug addicts they are committing a crime but are also victims of crime. The criminal gangs that victimize the first group have to operate in the U.S. in order to keep their clients from being discovered. This makes them vulnerable to US law enforcement agencies. Some of these groups have figured out that there is a lot less risk in working with the second group because they can leave their charges on the other side of the border so they can cross on their own with the intention of getting caught. The Biden administration is concentrating their effort on changing the conditions in the golden triangle countries so these people wont be encouraged to pay these criminal groups. While this is laudable it will take a good deal of time and resources to make these kinds of changes. A more immediate mission that would help stem this tide would be to go after the criminal gangs that are getting rich from these desperate people. This would require cooperation from Mexico and US law enforcement agencies. CBP should start enforcement efforts in Mexico much the same way the DEA does. With the threat of extradition and financial seizures these gangs might back away from human trafficking as the risk/reward ratio makes it less profitable. The larger cartels would go back to concentrating on drug trafficking and the smaller gangs might not have corrupt officials in their pockets and may decide to get out of the business to avoid prison.,political,Facebook
No! the Taliban will not take over Kabul & all of Afghanistan in 90 days. They will take it over in a matter of weeks or days at the most. The Afghan government & military will be annihilated in days. The innocent Afghanis who worked with the Americans will be raped tortured & slaughtered ! The stupidity & ignorance of the American government the carelessness 20 years of blood and tears trillions of dollars of taxpayer money & American credibility & honor down the drain in a matter of weeks. Now Biden is  asking  the Taliban to please not attack the US embassy in Kabul. This incompetent imposter & his entire administration are an embarrassment & a disgrace for America? I truly feel disturbed by the incompetence of this man & his direction of the US military & strategy & his weak generals. The Taliban met with the Chinese already Who will smartly get them To become allies.. The Chinese will buy & own Afghanistan like the rest of the world they have overtaken while were discussing & obsessing about transgender bathrooms & other complete nonsensical matters. Biden has been a failure all his life for both domestic & foreign affairs. His foreign policy & his miscalculation of international situations has always been a disaster. Now the problem is that unfortunately he is in charge. God help the poor Afghanis who are part of the government and the army & who were on the side of the Americans. They are already fleeing but I don t think they stand a chance. God help the woman of Afghanistan & God help America ! There is not one positive outcome since Biden has taken over. A disaster at the border inflation robbing Americans of their income crime rising to record levels & police resigning. Employers not finding workers due to stimulus that makes working not worth it & a complete mess with the mishandling of the Covid epidemic with conflicting daily misinformation & lack of direction. Everything is much more expensive including the most essential items such as food & gas prices. There is record spending & back breaking expenditures with no income to pay for the waste. Trillions of dollars of wasteful  stimuluswhich is really creating uncontrollable inflation & debt. There has never been so much division & uncertainty ! Its as though the mission of Biden his administration & the present day democrat party & their followers including their news media accomplices & government agencies is the destruction of America. The question which escapes me & millions of other Americans is WHY ?,political,Facebook
