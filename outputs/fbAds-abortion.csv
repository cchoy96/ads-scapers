At Trust Women Southwind Abortion Clinic in Oklahoma City they perform Abortions up to 21 weeks. I was told by the staff that the abortions past 21 weeks are referred to their other location in Wichita. Innocent children are having their arms and legs ripped off and then their skulls are crushed. Some are burned alive slowly having their eyes burned out of their sockets and their skin burned off first until they eventually die.  How can we continue to allow such horror such wickedness? For 47 years now we have only sought to regulate the brutal butchers of the most innocent humans among us saving only 1% and allowing the other 99% (approximately 63 million babies) to die such heinous unspeakable deaths. When will we wake up and obey the Lord who is calling out to His people to repent of their Abominations before He returns with his Judgement?  THOU SHALT NOT KILL  This is a Commandment of God.  These are the scriptures we as faithful and obedient followers of Christ must Obey if we are the True Remnant of God Left in Sodom and Babylon:  Micah 6:8 He hath shewed thee O man what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee but to do justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy God?  Matthew 13:31-32 Another parable put he forth unto them saying The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his field: [32] Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown it is the greatest among herbs and becometh a tree so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.  Luke 1:41-45 And it came to pass that when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost: [42] And she spake out with a loud voice and said Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb. [43] And whence is this to me that the mother of my Lord should come to me? [44] For lo as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears the babe leaped in my womb for joy. [45] And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.  Exodus 20:13 Thou shalt not kill.  Numbers 35:33 So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are : for blood it defileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein but by the blood of him that shed it.  Isaiah 9:6-7 For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful Counsellor The mighty God The everlasting Father The Prince of Peace. [7] Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this.  2 Chronicles 7:14 If my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land.  Genesis 1:27 So God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.  Genesis 4:10 And he said What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground.  Genesis 9:6 Whoso sheddeth man's blood by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.  Exodus 1:15-21 And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives of which the name of the one was Shiphrah and the name of the other Puah: [16] And he said When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women and see them upon the stools; if it be a son then ye shall kill him: but if it be a daughter then she shall live. [17] But the midwives feared God and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them but saved the men children alive. [18] And the king of Egypt called for the midwives and said unto them Why have ye done this thing and have saved the men children alive? [19] And the midwives said unto Pharaoh Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them. [20] Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied and waxed very mighty. [21] And it came to pass because the midwives feared God that he made them houses.  Proverbs 24:11-12 If thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death and those that are ready to be slain; [12] If thou sayest Behold we knew it not; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider it ? and he that keepeth thy soul doth not he know it ? and shall not he render to every man according to his works?  Proverbs 31:8-9 Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction. [9] Open thy mouth judge righteously and plead the cause of the poor and needy.  Isaiah 1:15-17 And when ye spread forth your hands I will hide mine eyes from you: yea when ye make many prayers I will not hear: your hands are full of blood. [16] Wash you make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil; [17] Learn to do well; seek judgment relieve the oppressed judge the fatherless plead for the widow.  Isaiah 10:1-2 Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees and that write grievousness which they have prescribed; [2] To turn aside the needy from judgment and to take away the right from the poor of my people that widows may be their prey and that they may rob the fatherless!  Isaiah 59:3-4 For your hands are defiled with blood and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies your tongue hath muttered perverseness. [4] None calleth for justice nor any pleadeth for truth: they trust in vanity and speak lies; they conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity.  Ecclesiastes 8:11 Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.  Amos 5:14-15 Seek good and not evil that ye may live: and so the Lord the God of hosts shall be with you as ye have spoken. [15] Hate the evil and love the good and establish judgment in the gate: it may be that the Lord God of hosts will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph.  Amos 5:18-24 Woe unto you that desire the day of the Lord ! to what end is it for you? the day of the Lord is darkness and not light. [19] As if a man did flee from a lion and a bear met him; or went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall and a serpent bit him. [20] Shall not the day of the Lord be darkness and not light? even very dark and no brightness in it? [21] I hate I despise your feast days and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies. [22] Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings I will not accept them : neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts. [23] Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols. [24] But let judgment run down as waters and righteousness as a mighty stream.  Psalm 139:13-16 For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb. [14] I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well. [15] My substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. [16] Thine eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them.  Romans 12:9 Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.  Romans 13:3-4 For rulers are not a terror to good works but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good and thou shalt have praise of the same: [4] For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.  James 1:27 Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction and to keep himself unspotted from the world.  Mark 11:23 For verily I say unto you That whosoever shall say unto this mountain Be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.  Acts 5:29 Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said We ought to obey God rather than men.  Luke 10:25-37 And behold a certain lawyer stood up and tempted him saying Master what shall I do to inherit eternal life? [26] He said unto him What is written in the law? how readest thou? [27] And he answering said Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy strength and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself. [28] And he said unto him Thou hast answered right: this do and thou shalt live. [29] But he willing to justify himself said unto Jesus And who is my neighbour? [30] And Jesus answering said A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among thieves which stripped him of his raiment and wounded him and departed leaving him half dead. [31] And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him he passed by on the other side. [32] And likewise a Levite when he was at the place came and looked on him and passed by on the other side. [33] But a certain Samaritan as he journeyed came where he was: and when he saw him he had compassion on him [34] And went to him and bound up his wounds pouring in oil and wine and set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him. [35] And on the morrow when he departed he took out two pence and gave them to the host and said unto him Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more when I come again I will repay thee. [36] Which now of these three thinkest thou was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves? [37] And he said He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him Go and do thou likewise.  Matthew 5:13-14 Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot of men. [14] Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.  Matthew 25:45 Then shall he answer them saying Verily I say unto you Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these ye did it not to me.  Ephesians 5:11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them.  2 Corinthians 10:6 And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled.  Matthew 7:12 Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.  1 John 3:16-18 Hereby perceive we the love of God because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. [17] But whoso hath this world's good and seeth his brother have need and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him how dwelleth the love of God in him? [18] My little children let us not love in word neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.  1 Corinthians 13:2 And though I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge; and though I have all faith so that I could remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing.  Luke 4:18 The Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised  John 15:13 Greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends.  Joshua 24:15 And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the Amorites in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord.  ~The Lady at the Gate~,political,Facebook
BREAKING NEWS: Federal District Judge Lee Yeakel issued a second temporary restraining order (TRO) preventing enforcement of Gov. Greg Abbott's executive order to delay elective medical procedures and surgeries including abortion as a way to conserve medical supplies needed to treat COVID-19.  This TRO allows abortions only at certain abortion facilities who challenged the law -- Planned Parenthood (7 cities) Whole Woman's Health (3 cities) Southwestern (Dallas) and Austin Women's. The TRO permits them to perform RU-486 abortions and very late abortions.  Other abortion facilities in Texas must continue to delay all abortions.

The Wedge  Im proudly a child of the 80s. The music was great fashion not so great and the Cold War was still present but a far cry from the Cuban Missile Crisis of the 1960s. We as a nation by and large recognized ourselves as part of an American family so to speak and the world as it were seemed safe. Whether you loved him or hated him The Reagan principle of Peace through Strength kept the world on as even of a keel as one could ask for. I played after school incessantly with my friends and we had a favorite game called War. The rules were simple as one might imagine each kid brought his biggest and best toy guns and we played for hours a breed of hide n seek only with weapons. To my knowledge none of my former playmates to this day have ever been involved in a mass shooting. Looking through the prism of history it was a glorious time where for once the old divisions did not seem to matter anymore. Minorities and women had ascended to some of the highest levels of leadership and industry and as a rule the term race and racism seemed to be remnants of a bygone era. Today there exist a wedge that has been driven like a wooden stake straight through the heart of this country. It has pitted us against each other in a way that I personally never thought we could develop into. It is though we have been separated and resegregated based on characteristics that run antithetical to everything the Civil Rights Movement stood for. What is the wedge exactly and more importantly how did we get here? To have an honest discussion about this topic we must all concede that leaders no matter what their stripes have the ability to be polarizing. I categorize two types of polarizing figures. There are those that are polarizing for the right reasons and those that divide for every reason that is wrong. For example Ben Shapiro in my opinion a polarizing figure for the right reasons. He makes honest fair assessments of situations in a time where for some reason this is looked upon as divisive hate speech even white supremacy which is remarkably interesting when you take into account that Ben Shapiro is an Orthodox Jew. Then you have the Linda Sarsars of the world whose rhetoric and speech are not only hateful but backed up in no way by fact or reason. As we all know Ben Shapiro should not be a polarizing figure but is because the time of real true free speech is over. Stereotypes as well have made a huge return only now the focus seems to be on mainly white America. If we are to have a true discussion we must be honest. Is there any other ethnicity in America today that is subjected to the level of sensitivity training and whatever else they can think of to somehow make white people feel bad about themselves? If that kind of action were perpetrated on any other ethnic group in this country it would be a return to slave days I guess Im not sure where you really go once youve played the Jim Crow Card. The leadership in Washington though divided by obvious ideological differences are all capable of injecting themselves into situations where it is not needed or make a bone headed statement that only serves to fan the flames of whatever the divide may be. In the years since the 80s and leading into the modern times the division has come at the hands of neo-progressives who seek to silence any opinion that might challenge their deeply held beliefs. Notice I did not say the left because quite frankly I grew up side by side with the left and the right but this new breed of ultra-left thinkers have somehow managed to find a way to completely dominate the narrative in this nation. Perhaps even worse though the ugly specter of racism has returned but it is a form of racism that is by and large imagined and always rooted in suppositions that just do not make any sense. The United States in many ways is comparable to a High School. Where there is an endless number of cliques each convinced of their superior thought and superior ideas. What has come to pass as a superior idea in contemporary society can be as simple as a completely reality detached statement made by someone paid millions of dollars to play a game. Nothing on its face seems to make much sense anymore. Its as though every positive statement about America has a but. We are a compassionate and generous nation but we are systemically racist internally. Millions of people from all over the world dream of making it to our shores but we are an extremely oppressive society especially with those that are different from us. Of course you receive the same chorus of statements that get more to the point. America is driven by white supremacy. America is and always has been about inequality. With the presence of such inane and blanket statements where does anyone find any common ground? When one makes a blanket statement about an entire race of people how do you approach that person and try to have a dialogue to try and better understand why it is they feel this way. With the actions of the past year getting a man on the street opinion might get you beat up. It is like we are all out to get each other but for what. Does Black America really believe that myself and millions just like me hate them and think that somehow they are less than in my eyes. It is a proposition that sounds absolutely ludicrous and yet I guarantee you could find quite a few people who believe that. How did people in America come to think such things politics plain and simple. In the days before the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the accompanying Civil Rights Movement black Americans especially those in the south found themselves not much better off than the days that they were in bondage. Back breaking work share cropping and making barely enough to keep your family fed. This time in American history is where we witnessed a mass migration to the cities of America in search of not only jobs but a hope to escape the segregation and subhuman treatment of the deep south. In the cities there were jobs to be had and money to be made for those that possessed the entrepreneurial spirit. It seemed like a perfect formula. The only problem was is that though black America thought that the north was this place where racism somehow did not exist or at least not as bad as what they had experienced outside the city. However they would find like in all big cities people are by and large neo-phobic. As a result they saw that even though they had made the move to the city the racism and discrimination still existed. The wages were there but were usually barely enough to keep a roof over your head and food on the table. Slowly but surely the inner cities of the US became harder and harder places to live as violence and crime began to run rampant. The poverty and despair that existed back then that still to this day causes so many to think that the only way out is to turn to fast money. Pity that fast money and crime are almost synonymous with each other. In the 1960s post JFK the POTUS was a rather vile racist Im not proud to say is from my home State of Texas. Lyndon Baines Johnson was one of those Presidents whose legacy is bathed in young Americans blood and rife with racist policies that have helped more than anything to mold society into what it is today. At the time minorities in the inner cities were certainly victims and at that time I think the idea of welfare as a means to get you on your feet was not such a bad policy. Almost from the start though folks were gaming and using the system so that they could stay home all day and do whatever they wanted so long as the check kept coming every month. My paternal Grandfather of whom I am proudly his namesake passed away in 1966 leaving my Grandma to take care of herself and four kids. Though no one in the world could think of a more deserving family in need of help my Grandma refused to go on welfare. She elected instead to take a job as a Secretary and worked for almost 50 years in that field. An old friend of my Grandpa built houses and let my Grandma finance through his company and though it was hard my Dad and his three siblings never wanted for anything. My Dad told me that sometimes it annoyed him that the people on welfare made more money than his family and never lifted a finger. Welfare was meant to be a temporary fix but as LBJ knew full well it was an elaborate ruse to turn the minorities of this nation into a dependent class of citizens. Is it any wonder that crime remained even metastasized in some cases and slowly but surely the fatherless rate began to increase? The biggest cause of father absence in my humble opinion is that through welfare women did not need a man if she did not want one. Her check would still come whether her babies Daddy hung around or not. This factor plus men shirking their responsibilities and the worst scourge of all abortion have all been the perfect mixture to make folks in inner cities not only dependent but reliable in that the politicians know so long as they keep dolling the people will keep voting. The Great Society veiled in all its promise to rid the country of poverty and make racial equality the forefront of LBJs agenda. In truth he once told a staffer that if he could get his legislation passed he would Have those ni##ers voting democrat for 200 years. It was all by design to keep minorities where he and many of his fellow Democrats exactly wanted them poor and dependent in the cities. Not empowerment to be able to have access to better jobs and a chance at the American dream but in essence to completely re-enslave the inner-city minorities of this nation. One need look no further than the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina to see still how dependent people are on the government. This is the systemic racism that people speak of. Though the media has done its part to fan the flames the politicians have constantly used incidents of crime to weaponize racism against their political foes. The unholy alliance between the media and the left has served to do nothing but bring this nation to a point that I am actually afraid. Post George Floyd which was an amazing opportunity for us to unite but was immediately politicized and the anarchy that followed may never be repaired. Every time I think that we have common ground someone or some group comes in and makes it about racism though the reasons get more and more insane by the day. So much so that AOC recently lectured all of us to remind us that even Climate change is to blame for racism. I keep waiting for Rod Serling to jump out and tell me what I am seeing is not real. So far to date I am still waiting. So what is the solution? I will not cop out and say your guess is as good as mine but in reality its pretty much the truth. I can remember the Black Power movement of my generation with Public Enemy and everyone having their Sista Soljah moment. After the election of a two-term black President I had thought that maybe we were back to a time where race was not the end all be all of human existence. I keep trying to think about legislation that has already been proposed yet every time I turn around our current President is reminding me that I am inherently racist. It is utterly amazing; he knows things about me that I dont even know myself. There must be common ground though. Somewhere out there something must exist that we can all as Americans be proud of and rally behind. I have seen so many great activists try to do that very thing and have had success doing it. People like Starr Parker and the great Candace Owens come to mind. I admire their ability to look critically at the real problems in America today no matter how vile the backlash may be. I do not want to sit at the table with ANTIFA or BLM for that matter. All they do is divide us at every possible turn. I genuinely believe that with grassroots organizing most especially with faith leaders is our only chance to affect a positive change on the Wedge that constantly is hammered to drive us all further and further apart. It pains me to go through social media these days and hear almost a hope for a civil war. I know I do not want that and I believe in my heart that most Americans do not either. I have always tried to teach my children to be color blind. My wife and I must be doing something right because almost without exception my kids best friends are minorities. I truly hope and pray that maybe one day we will again be the American family where everyones opinion is protected. Where we can come together to find solutions to the problems that we have because they are hard and require us all. Our leaders are supposed to be the ones that work to unite us the most. Politics is not a service done out of responsibility so much as opportunity. So long as that is what motivates the majority of legislators nothing will change. Let us not give up though. Just like I believe that we do not need the government intruding into our lives I do not want them intruding in our differences either. The best charity and the best help has always come from citizens acting on their own. We must share this land whether we like it or not is it truly too much to hope that we can share what brings us together. It can happen. We all can affect change in our own lives. We all make the world the way it is and as has been said through history a house divided cannot stand.  The Pamphleteer,political,Facebook
Zioness Statement on Women's March Inc.'s Removal of Zahra Billoo from its Leadership Committee  Zioness is fighting for an American feminist movement and a broader progressive movement that is inclusive of American Jews. Today is a victory in that fight.  After years of pain anger dialogue and action from American Jewish women and our allies expressing our grief over Womens March Incs apparent deeply engrained institutional antisemitism we were disheartened and outraged to see Zahra Billoo appointed to the organizations Leadership Committee. Zahra Billoo has repeatedly and viscerally attacked American Jews as Zionists andmost importantly for those who care about the integrity of the American feminist movementshe refuses dialogue and interfaith work with the Jewish community and has even attacked Muslim Americans who participate in it. This behavior is antithetical to the progressive movement especially intersectional solidarity-based activism which demands that we not leave any group behind.  While Ms. Billoo should never have been appointed we applaud the Womens March Inc. leadership for voting to remove her. After years of waffling and empty statements in response to the Jewish communitys attempts to communicate our pain and alienation this swift decisive action is welcomed. Action matters. While in many cases dialogue and evolution would be preferred to dismissal explicit unapologetic antisemitism must be met with consequences no matter where when or from whom it manifests.  We are proud of Jewish women for their resilience and refusal to give up or cede the feminist movement to outright bigotry. We are grateful to Womens March Incs leadership for doing what needed to be done. Antisemitism is the core organizing principle of white nationalism; until all progressive leaders recognize and actively combat this phenomenon all our marginalized communities will be less safe.  Zioness exists to unify and amplify the voice of the vast majority of American Jews especially women who identify overwhelmingly as both unabashedly progressive and unapologetically Zionist. When we stand up for all our values refuse to check any piece of our identities at the door and reject false choices we move forward with strength and purpose. While there will be many more challenges ahead today exemplifies what we can accomplish when we remain true to all of our authentic selves.  At a time when the fight for abortion rights is at a tipping point; LGBTQ women and especially transgender women of color are under attack; and accused rapists sit on the Supreme Court and sleep in the White House we need an indivisible effective feminist movement that can punch back and stand up for all women. It finally feels like were on our way there.  Zahra Billoo wrote last night that the Womens March is no longer the organization she was once proud of and that it had changed. We hope thatjust this onceshe is right.  #ZionessSpeaksForMe,political,Facebook

Dear Trump 2020 voters:  Im an American just like you. Im concerned about our country just like you.  Im a Lifelong Republican just like many of you. I have voted Republican for President most elections just like many of you.  Im a Protestant Christian believer just like many of you. I also have Catholic Jewish Mormon Muslim and non-believer family and friends. I believe we are all welcome in America.  Im opposed to abortion just like many of you. I believe in exceptions for rape incest health of the mother and inability of the fetus to survive outside the womb. I believe better than legislation good health care including free birth control is the key to reduced abortions. Free birth control is part of the current Federal Law for inclusion in all Health Insurance. Protection for Pre-Existing Conditions is also part of the current Federal Law for inclusion in all Health Insurance. I believe the current administration should stop trying to take that Federal Law away from all of us.  Im the descendant of immigrants just like many of you. I have friends that are First Generation Immigrants just like many of you have. I have family members and friends that are descendants of African Slaves just like many of you. I have family members that are part Native American just like many of you.  Im concerned about the poor reputation of our country in the world just like many of you.  Im a supporter of the U.S. military just like you. I have many veterans and active duty military in my family just like you. I support good Veterans care just like you. I respect our All-Volunteer Military just like you. I respect our Drafted Veterans that served just like you.  Im a straight married guy just like many of you. Unlike some of you I have a lesbian family member. I love her so dearly I performed her wedding ceremony to her wife a few years ago. They are like second daughters to me I love them so much. I support LGBT rights.  Im a White guy just like many of you. Like many of of you I worry about the safety of my family. I worry about the safety of my extended family. I worry about the safety of my friends families. Unlike some of you I have an African-American niece and two beautiful African-American grandnieces. I worry about their safety as they grow up. Unlike me as a White man to be safe they have to be extra careful in America wherever they go.  I support the majority of those serving as our police just like you. Because I support the police I want them to operate to protect all Americans including my African-American Niece and her African-American daughters. Because for years now African-Americans are being shot and killed by police at two and a half (2.5) times the rate of Whites like me my nephew and niece have to teach their African-American daughters extra safety measures. As they grow older unless we change policing they will be in danger of being shot and killed by police for being American while Black.  I support the peaceful Black Lives Matters demonstrators fighting for changes in policing.  Im on Social Security just like many of you. Im concerned about the security of the Social Security Trust Fund just like many of you.  Im very concerned about our National Debt just like many of you. In fact one of the times I didnt vote Republican I voted for Ross Perot in 1992 like many of you because I was so concerned about the National Debt. I was very concerned about the 2017 Tax Cut because it did not turn out as promised. The Individual Tax Cut was limited small Temporary and only 15% of the total. The Corporate Tax Cut was huge Permanent and more than half of it was immorally used by Large Corporations just to buy back their own stocks; not as we were promised for new investments or improved workers wages and benefits. Worse It did not pay for itself as promised. Its adding $1.5 to $2 Trillion to our already bloated National Debt.  Im concerned about medical costs just like many of you. Im on Medicare just like many of you. Im worried about Medicare funding just like many of you.  Im concerned about Covid19 just like many of you. Im an older person at higher risk just like many of you. Im concerned because I have pre-existing conditions making me more susceptible to Covid19 just like many of you. Im concerned about this Global Pandemic that has already killed 188942 Americans and 889364 people worldwide just like many of you.  As I said at the beginning I am a Lifelong Republican just like many of you. Since 1972 I have usually voted Republican for President just like many of you.  I have decided this year to Vote Democrat for President as many other Lifelong Republicans are doing.  I would ask you to consider joining me and voting for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. I believe they will lead us better than the current administration. Thank you for your consideration. Chuck Eddy Lexington KY  #RegisterToVote GoVoteKy . Com,political,Facebook
Celebrate  Today the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Equality Act which would prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.  Also today Taiwan became the first country in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage.  Yes I know America is on the edge of war with Iran and several states have jumped on an anti-abortion crazy train.

My thoughts on the matter: We should all be careful and safe but we always need to question government. If they can present logical and sensible explanations for their edicts then we can trust and abide by the policies. If there is no reasonable clarification for why Im safe at the supermarket with my distancing & mask but I am not safe at church with my distancing & mask then I wont trust their orders for mandatory compliance. Taxpayers pay government officials salaries. They work for us.

Shannon was a typical kid. She liked watching TV climbing trees running around her neighborhood. She had long hair and long arms as she was growing into a tween. She went to church. Her family was in law enforcement in her town. And as she was growing into her 12-year-old body she was being raped by a relative.  She became pregnant at 12 years old. She didn't know it until well after she missed her period. Unlike most kids her age she knew it came every 32 days. When it didn't come she thought maybe this month was a little different. More days passed. She started feeling sick she started vomiting. She thought about one of her favorite shows - Full House - and went to the store to get a pregnancy test. She felt embarrassed so she said she was picking up a test for her mom. She went into some woods climbed a tree and tested herself alone. She was pregnant with her rapist's child.  In America at least 20% of young girls are sexually assaulted 75% of them by a relative. Of those girls who are sexually assaulted by family members well over 60% are raped.  States throughout our country - including Missouri - are pushing laws to force 12-year-old girls like Shannon to carry their rapists' children no matter the mental impact it will forever have on the children forced into 9 months of pregnancy after being raped. Not only babies having babies but babies forced to have babies by their rapists and their government.  Children are more likely to suffer physical consequences from their pregnancies. They're more likely to have complicated pregnancies to suffer from severe depression to die during the process.  In 1973 when the Supreme Court ruled that women have a right to get abortions the Court didn't say that abortions were good or bad. They said that they are a right we have to be free from the regulation of the state that the government should not impose its view or its restrictions on women at a moment when only the pregnant woman can truly understand what she is going through.  The Supreme Court did not stop the states from making their communities better for women and children and making sure that all pregnant women were served well in America. It said the conversation a woman has with her doctor is none of the state's business.  When abortion was illegal women still had them because the reasons to have them - nonviable pregnancies substantial risks to health inability to afford a child unsupportive partners and families rape - were ever-present. And as we ban the practice in America again those reasons still exist.  If this was about helping women or babies we would be passing legislation to ensure expectant mothers have all the resources they could ever need. We would make sure women had excellent pre-natal and mental health care. We would form supportive community groups that provided accurate medical information to women. We would make it easy for women to make the right choice for them in America.  But this isn't about women or babies. America has one of the worst infant mortality rates among wealthy countries. Missouri's rate is even worse than our already terrible national average. And despite bills being proposed to support pregnant mothers those aren't being passed. Those bills don't get the televised support of the governor like this forced-pregnancy bill has gotten.  Instead of making pregnancy safer our government has decided to require it. It's not about making people safer. It's not about addressing the reasons why abortions happen. It's not about understanding that without access to health care many women will die. It's not about the wellbeing of 12-year-olds like Shannon. It's about control. It's about a government with the power to make even the most private decisions for women. It's about having a male-dominated government that includes very few legislators with medical expertise tell women and their doctors that the government knows best.  This Missouri forced-pregnancy law is unconstitutional. It breaches the separation of church and state - it includes religious tenets in the actual bill - and it violates our right to privacy and to be free from government regulation in making such important medical decisions. It will cost the state a lot of money to litigate and defend the law despite its unconstitutionality. The Attorney General's Office should be providing litigation cost estimates for bills like this one that are glaringly unconstitutional for the public to see. Instead of putting that money into making our state a better home for mothers and children we're going to waste it on lawyers.  That's because this isn't about protecting anyone. It's about control. Missouri will not be a better place because women and children are forced by their government into pregnancy. That's not pro-life. That's pro-cruelty. If pro-life is what you want I'd humbly recommend we make sure our mothers stop dying in our hospitals we don't force 12-year-olds into pregnancy and we quit telling women and their doctors we know better.,political,Facebook
I have an urgent prayer request for my fellow Christians and conservative Oklahomans!  One of the bills that I have had the honor of co-authoring SB 1728 the Unborn Person Wrongful Death Act just hit the House Floor!  There are a couple big time lobbyist groups fighting tooth and nail to stop this bill as they endeavor protect the billion dollar abortion industry its exploitation of women and the murder of unborn babies in this state! Some of them even come as wolves in sheeps clothing pretending that they want to end abortion while actively lobbying against every viable piece of prolife legislation!  But I have faith in the power of the lord and the will of Oklahoman voters! Were in Gods Counry and I know that we will triumph!  Once this bill passes with your prayerful support it will create civil protections for unborn babies and women who have been tricked or coerced into abortions by unscrupulous abortion providers! Why anyone would want to protect the ability of an abortionist to deceive defraud or coerce women into abortion is beyond me!  This is Senate Act 1728 so Ill end this urgent prayer request as most things aught to be ended: with a verse from the Bible!  Acts 17:28 For in him we live and move and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said For we are also his offspring.,political,Facebook
**THOUGHT OF THE DAY** Why are we arguing with Democrats on Abortion and Birth Control. Think about it!,political,Facebook
When it comes to abortion I think two of the greatest factors in coming to this decision have to do with the womans right of having an abortion and then the fact that human life begins at conception. (l purposely did not say the word human person but human life) The question then becomes for the pregnant woman considering abortionwhat is the greater value to her at this time the value of human life in her uterus or the value of not having that human life as part of her life at this time or maybe not at anytime. Only the woman herself can weigh the values at hand and make a choice.  God incarnate in Christ Jesus in the uterus of His earthly mother Mary began too as a single cell conceptus and can therefore represent all human life at all stages of development including into adulthood. My message to the unborn as though they can hear is that you too are represented in the presence of God The Father through Jesus Christ your advocate. No matter where all of us are in life Jesus has already been there and have experienced life in and out of the uterus and its challenges as is in every stage of human development of life. For we do not have a High Priest who is unable to sympathize and understand our weaknesses and temptations but One who has been tempted [knowing exactly how it feels to be human] in every respect as we are yet without [committing any] sin. Hebrews 4:15 AMP  The Bible also says Jesus Himself grew in wisdom and stature having gained favor in the sight of God and man. Human beings while yet only in the mind of God are given purpose and even a name and a destiny before even becoming a human conceptus. Luke 1:30-33.  Considering abortion is one of the greatest decisions a woman can make in life and she deserves as much information as is available in coming to her choice. Of course my choice is life for all human life whether just life or a human person but I neither condemn nor disrespect those choosing otherwise. I differentiate human life and human person to avoid philosophical and scientific discussions of opinions of when a human life becomes a person.  In the Bible (Luke 1:42-44) Jesus was addressed by Elizabeth as Lord in the early first trimester of Marys pregnancy suggesting His personhood was already established early in her pregnancy. In the Bible Proverbs 3:56 is certainly applicable for every woman considering abortion and who wishes the wisdom and peace of God in this critical decision. This discussion today on abortion decisions is only one line in the great magnitude of this subject matter. We will discuss more at another time.

Follow up to yesterday's post. What I will do differently as a member of Congress. On my first day in Congress I will meet with the Republican leader in the House of Representatives and let them know I will not move from these three things: 1. I will never vote for a budget bill that adds even one penny to the federal debt. 2. I will never vote for a budget bill that has even one penny in it for Planned Parenthood. Yes I am opposed to abortion. Nonprofit organizations like Planned Parenthood: A. Have access to plenty of money outside government B. Hundreds of other organizations provide women's health care. If we to give tax dollars to one organization because it provides women's health care then we should give to all. 3. We must start NOW to cut spending. A. Pass a bill that mandates the executive branch of government to sell or give away the 77000 vacant or underutilized buildings it owns. In 2012 Jason Chaffetz proposed a bill to do this and was blind sided by a Soros-funded organization that misrepresented the bill and it was pulled. We can now be prepared for the opposition. B. Both Amtrak and the Postal Service must be privatized. This one is made more difficult by the generous federal government pensions promised employees but we CAN strike a deal that takes all the elements into consideration. In short I will be an agent for change. It won't be easy but the people of Utah's 2nd District deserve a citizen servant who will work tirelessly to uphold Utah values.,political,Facebook

In my humble opinion I believe that the termination of a pregnancy should be the last resort. Especially when legislation is passed that allows full term abortion. If you want to terminate a child why do you need to wait till the last minute. It is not fair to the life that is in you. A life that can exist outside of the womb. I understand that unfortunately we have women that have been raped. This is where the law has to be clear. This is the period where women should consider a pill that prevents implantation [Plan B] that experts say works best when taken after a sexual encounter. At a point a viable embryo attaches to be fed nourished you have LIFE in most cases being in the time frame of 7-10 days. In cases of deformities disabilities disorders or children who will need round the clock care do they not deserve a chance at life outside of the womb. If the sole argument is my body my choice then the same goes for the unborn child they have a body but where is their choice?,political,Facebook
"Em Hotep Nefer   Come the year 2050 according to the metrics of continental geopolitical ethnography Western Europe will become a Muslim enclave and Africa will become a Chinese continent. In 1974 Chairman Mao Zedong put forward the theory of the three worldsChinaEuropeAfrica..Europeans became complete atheists from the 1950s after WWII..They decided to cut down Religious mind control and ended up closing down most churches and turned the buildings into libraries and community museums only leaving a few historical ones that have more to do with their royal system..They thought they are more liberal that way and would rank higher on countries where people are free to do whatever they like and also boost the economies. Little did they know that the vacuum created has to be filled up with something else..There is now a lot of Moslems living in Europe and they are in an aggressive missionary mood too..*While European leaders are taking steps to reverse this trend; African politicians instead of setting up a ""sinking fund"" against Chinese onslaught are just happy to revel in their own batty of their leaders eating junk handouts.* _Fact 1:_ Compared to Africa communist China is a little country indeed Africa is about four times the size of China. Yet the population of China is 1.5 billion same as the population of Africa.. _Fact 2:_ In terms of mineral resources Africa is the world's richest continent and it is a hundred times richer than China.. _Fact 3:_ China wants Africa's land and resources by hook or crook to ensure the survival of the Chinese race.. The Chinese communist party's policy for Africa is a POPULATION SWAP solution that will ensure the survival of the Chinese race..It is laid out in an obnoxious instrument from 1963 and follow-up meetings with Nyerere Mugabe Chissano Dos Santos Museveni Vella Pillay of SACP and other African leaders..US assisted many European countries during world wars and demanded disbursements in the form of money land islands infrastructures government control etc..On the other hand China helped most African countries to gain independence from Western imperialists..They also built a number of projects like dams bridges power generation points hospitals universities agricultural and projects like the Tanzania-Zambia Railway standing as monuments to Sino-African friendship..*But do Chinese look like they can just help you for free? Think again.*  Recently you needed a certificate allowing you to bear one child in China..With the law-enforced one-child policy in place there is a problem: as the child come of age becoming parents themselves one adult child is left with having to provide support for his two parents and four grandparents..Called the ""4-2-1 Problem""..Mandatory abortion contraception and sterialisation laws imposed also come with some moral questions: *who would really want to _kill_ their own children corner women into limited control over their own bodies and render the men _powerless_?* Why not exercise these necessary evils on the dark continent?..  China intends to send half a billion people into Africa before the end of year 2040 and these families will be encouraged to bear four to five children so that by year 2050 (as population will double) there will be over 2 billion Chinese in Africa. During that same period African population is _strangely projected to decrease drastically by some unknown occurrences_..End game the Chinese population in Africa will surpass the African population by 2050..*China will effectively own the African continent and its resources..Afrikans and their descendants across the globe are still lucking Unity and the Spirit of UBUBTU that was deliberately destroyed by Asiatic Arabs Europeans amongst them the Ashkenazi..  As at end of year 2020 over 50 million *Chinese citizens* have already being pushed onto the African continent some of them hardened criminals taken out of jails as they believe in the barbarity needed..Dejavu this events a repeated cycle in Afrikan Native lands..There are about 2.5 million in South Africa about 2 million in Nigeria over a million each in Ghana and Ivory Coast about a million in Zambia as well as Zimbabwe and hundreds of thousands in Kenya Tanzania South Sudan Rwanda Ethiopia Congo Liberia among other regions..There are pockets of them everywhere in 54 African countries in Africa..This events are forcing South Africa to cancel Chinese free visas..  In readiness for the takeover the Chinese are snapping up African roads rail seaports and airports..Their _modus operandi_ is to grant African countries some *toxic loans* to build their much needed infrastructure and get African leaders to sign a shrouded contract written in Mandarin that will permanently transfer the ownership of these ports to the Chinese nation..  Kudos to the eagle-eyed President John Magufuli of Tanzania who *tore up a contract* signed by his predecessor and told the Chinese to go home  of course he met with untimely death..Rwandan president was recently cautioned by a visit from Chinese President Xi Jinping after trying to expel 18 Chinese businessmen for mistreating locals..He ended up just announcing a veiled general statement that Africa must not export its raw materials but went on to sign 15 bilateral agreements with China some of them written in mandarin..  In Djibouti the Chinese deceptively taking over that small *country's seaport* and setting it up as their military base..There is a military build-up going on there now as the US have also setup a base there to keep the communists in check..Zambia is under surveillance as the new president is trying to check the level of chinese fungus.  China is pushing hard to get their citizens into the *police force* of all African countries..Zambia allegedly recently commissioned a few Chinese nationals into their police force but had to take the uniforms off them after public outrage..There are Mandarin speaking Chinese police officers roaming the streets in South Africa they even have their own police stations and can arrest detain and interrogate offenders in SA including South Africans..  In all African countries this is standard Chinese policy in fact most Chinese companies in Africa have *fully armed Chinese security guards* who from time to time turn their weapons on Africans..There was a recent incidence in SA where a Chinese employer locked up his workers under the guard of Chinese security and forced them to work for one week against their will..  In Kenya for several years now Mandarin has been taught to low income kids for free around the cities slums like Kibra in Nairobi..Chinese building East Africans infrastructure do bring in their own machines and their own employees hiring less than 1% of the Natives..Chinese Bosses in Kenya have on numerous times videotaped beating African employees with whips and sticks for coming late to work..The Chinese had their own restaurants in Kenya with signs that read No African/Black people Allowed where one was recently shutdown by the authorities..  In Mozambique the Chinese built a whole city of about 400000 houses and these were initially lauded as impressive developments *Mozambicans are not allowed in there* only the Chinese..There are similar Chinese cities like this in other African countries..  In Nigeria the Chinese are hiding in *mineral rich rural areas* and are heavily involved in illegal mining dozens of them were recently arrested in Osun and Zamfara..There are many more hiding in the rural communities where they are protected by powerful tin gods..They have also infiltrated the Zimbabwean rural areas like moles burrowing out every sweet potato in the ground. Mining concessions are politically given to Chinese companies easily..In most African states Mandarin the Chinese language has being introduced into the secondary school curriculum..  China has over the years put itself forward as a geriatric Savior who wants to help Africa grow and has all along given sympathy and support in their struggles against colonialism and for national independence and liberation..But after we saw the way Africans were molested in China during the Covid19 debacle we now understand their true intensions..They want our resources but they don't want us..Africans were dragged out of their hotels denied access to hospitals eateries and were not even allowed into supermarkets..Some were chased down the streets and beaten blue black by the communist police..Almost as if it was a dry-run for the near future..There was an art gallery where we saw the Chinese comparing us to monkeys and that gallery has not yet being pulled down..  For all Africans it is time to take action to cut down on the Chinese influx into Africa to stop the illegal mining of our mineral resources to stop the ongoing dehumanisation of Africans on our own soils..We need to pay attention if we don't want to pay the price yet again..China is not a friend of Africa and we do not need China..China has only one diabolical intention they want to take what is ours they want to lay claim to our inheritance in the same unfortunate way the Asiatic-Hebrews European-Christians and Arab-Muslims did before..  Africa was brutalised by robbers from the North for the longest since around 1000BCE by the West since 1500AD a long time and now looters from the East want to outdo the exploitation and finish it off..As long as Africa remains divided by ethnicities social class European boundaries mountains rivers and legislatures that continue to serve well to the greedy politicians as they are the middlemen who transact business from our resources to our former colonizers like France Britain Germany Belgium n their likes we will forever remain the _poor but richest _ continent..

"It's almost Mother's Day. So there is a case coming before the Supreme Court to not only limit women's choices to become mothers but to give those choices to ""charities universities hospitals and for-profit companies that might claim a religious objection"" (Washington Post May 6) Birth control and by extension abortion are methods women use to decide when they want to have children. Women may already have all the children (or more) than they can handle. They may be too young or too old to want children. They might just not want a pregnancy or baby at some particular time when a future time would be better.  Women need to make our own choices! Whether to have children and when to have them. Today sexual relationships do not have to result in pregnancy or childbirth but there are people who apparently believe that they should. Birth control: a woman controlling her own body. Some people seem to find that intolerable.  There is an irony here for me. When I desperately wanted to have children I could not. My first pregnancy miscarried. I did have one by infertility treatmentand one by adoption.Sometimes the choices are not the ones we are expecting. But we must have the power to do what seems BEST FOR US ourselves.  In my book ""Bearing Children: A Memoir of Choices"" (on Amazon) I talk about this. It is the main focus of the book. A friend said she thought it was a meditation on motherhood and in a way it is. But it is primarily about all of the choices that life presented me and others: deciding whether to get or stay pregnant whether and how to adopt and how to raise my children once I had them. Motherhood is a tough job.It should be a woman's own choice.  Happy Mother's Day.  .",political,Facebook

I've really debated whether or not I should write on this. Being a man it is impossible for me to relate exactly to what a woman is going through with pregnancy. I'm not even going to try.

During our four years in Augusta Congressman Jared Golden and I were on the opposite ends of many crucial issues.  GUN RIGHTS  I sponsored and passed Constitutional Carry to ensure our right to keep and bear arms without a government permission slip. Meanwhile Golden voted against Constitutional Carry three times voting to disarm Maine people and keep us defenseless.  WELFARE REFORM  As Senate Chairman for the Health and Human Services Committee I negotiated Welfare Reform prohibiting the purchase of alcohol cigarettes and lottery tickets with welfare dollars. Golden voted to allow these abusive purchases to continue and to expand welfare for non-citizens.  HEALTHCARE FREEDOM  I spearheaded the effort for Right to Try allowing terminally ill Maine people to try potentially life-saving investigational medicines that haven't completed the FDA approval process. Golden sided with Washington bureaucrats against sick Maine people voting against Right to Try.  RIGHT TO LIFE  I co-sponsored legislation to require parental consent for underage abortions and argued for it on the floor of the Maine Senate. Golden voted to allow minors to undergo abortion procedures without any input from their parents.   But Jared's record of depriving Maine people of our freedoms and our paychecks did not end in Augusta. He continues supporting an anti-freedom agenda in Washington DC.  GOVERNMENT SPYING  I sponsored the 4th Amendment Protection Act in the Maine Senate to oppose Washington DC's warrantless spying on the American people through our digital devices. Jared Golden however recently voted to renew the PATIOT Act to continue these unconstitutional infringements on American privacy rights.  CORPORATE WELFARE  I stood alone in the Maine Senate against Corporate Welfare like the Maine Capital Investment Fund a state level corporate welfare program that gives taxpayer-financed sweetheart loans to well-connected big businesses. Not only did Jared Golden vote for this corporate welfare program on the state level he just voted to support the Export-Import Bank a federal corporate welfare program that does exactly the same thing  just on a more massive scale with billions in our taxpayer money.  ENDLESS WAR  Our troops have been thrown into two decades of undeclared war in the Middle East with no end in sight. Our veterans overwhelmingly say its time to come home and I agree with them. But Jared Golden has opposed President Trump's efforts to bring our troops home from Syria and Afghanistan wanting to keep our soldiers fighting for a third decade with no clear mission.

"I am pro-choice. That does not mean that I promote abortion but rather believe in a woman's bodily autonomy and liberty to regulate her uterus. You will not shame me or other Catholics for holding this view. But if you're going to try please throw out your condoms and the pill. Don't waste your seed. Refrain from oral copulation. And be sure to remain chaste until marriage.  As someone that was born and raised Catholic I am becoming increasingly disappointed with the Churchs inconsistency particularly concerning the sanctity of life and reproduction. I drove by St. Annes Catholic Church in Beaumont earlier this week and saw a sign that stated: Planned Parenthood separates children from their parents forever. It's a play on a hot topic in politics today: undocumented immigrants being separated from their children. Rather than posting a sign calling for unity as a nation in protecting families under any circumstance they hyperfocus on one singular issue. Several signs are displaying similar sentiments outside every church.  Officially Catholics have a zero-tolerance policy concerning abortion no matter the risk imposed on a woman's life. Regardless of whether or not the fetus is viable. If she's raped too bad. In addition to abortion per the Church ANY form of contraception is wrong including condoms spermicides intrauterine devices the pill etc. Interestingly there are no signs showing condoms with a big red X. Why is that? Take a look at married couples and the number of children they have sitting in the pews. If they have one or two they're likely utilizing some form of contraception. If youre going to rail against abortion you better keep it consistent and denounce all forms of contraception smack dab in front of the church. And yes papal encyclicals have indicated that the Church views abortion and contraception as violating the ""natural law"". Keep it consistent or drop it. Those of us that pay attention are getting tired of the selective outrage and feigned moral indignation.",political,Facebook
City Council will hold a workshop on Tuesday August 3rd @3pm at City Hall 411 W 8th St-5th floor  City Council is set to hold a workshop on Tuesday at which time many topics will be discussed. A workshop is generally for discussion only but Tuesday's Council will discuss and vote on the debt issuance of $95 Million for the Water Treatment Plant. They will also discuss how to spend the $20.3 million dollars the city received from The American Rescue Plan a governmental Covid-19 relief handout as well as allowing the idea of Odessa becoming a sanctuary city for the unborn to go to the voters.  Abortion is and has always been a sensitive topic of discussion. If council votes to allow a special election on November 2 2021 the voters would get to decide whether or not to establish an ordinance which would outlaw abortion and declare the City of Odessa a SANCTUARY CITY FOR THE UNBORN. I do believe council should allow the people to vote up or down on a topic as important as this.  If the Council approves the Certificates of Obligation for the Water Treatment Plant it will go out for bid in a few short weeks. I personally would like to see the 20.3 million dollars from the American Rescue Plan applied to the repairs at the Water Treatment Plant and the amount of debt issued reduced by that much. COUNCIL MEMBERS THOMPSON AND WILLIS have stated that getting the repairs done at the water treatment plant is a top priority for them. Let us see if they put THE money where their mouth is or choose another project to spend these millions on.  Involvement = Accountability (Stay informed),political,Facebook

The new Texas law has some big holes in its language that should extend the period from when a pregnancy is detected to when an abortion is still legal. The medical community has commonly defined a fetus as an unborn child beginning the 9 th week after gestation which is typically the 11 th week after a womans last menstrual cycle. Prior to this the growing child is considered an embryo. The activity detected at 6 weeks is actually electrical pulses emanating from the embryo in the tissue that will become a heart. The term fetal heartbeat is used by doctors to describe this phenomenon to patients but is not scientifically accurate. This has been compared to a doctor telling the patient they have a stomach bug. Further language in the law describes the heartbeat as the steady and rhythmic contraction of the fetal heart in the gestational sac. Not only is it not a fetus at 6 weeks there is no muscle tissue to contract at that point. I can not believe these idiot lawmakers did not thoroughly look at the language in this bill and used a term fetal heartbeat in such an unscientific manner. They even had a list of definitions at the beginning of the bill but did not define the term fetus.,political,Facebook

Everyone saw it coming. Barreling down the political tracks like a run away freight. The cheering in Alabama has never stopped and the engineer need only blow the horn for the faithful to come back to the trough and take another big bite of a tasty Trump. It seems it just cannot get any better than this! Caught up in the moment the masses converted to a herd mentality failed to see the cliff and over they went. The Tea party destroyed conservative fiscal principles gone Evangelicals slowly crawling away from Savior Trump Rocket Man back to building Nukes after making a fool of the President the US House back under Democratic control and the good news for Alabama is the Republican Party has converted to a Democratic Platform. Higher taxes Medicaid expansion increased funding for Pre-K and a new Governor who has always been a conservative Democrat and still is. America is working it's magic! Oh there will still be the racist DNA handed down from generation to generation but they are not in charge and as hard as they try to remove the stench of hatred and bigotry the smell test is never passed.

If you are a Catholic or other Christian Jew Muslim or other person opposing Abortion I recommend you read John Carrs essay to help with your decision about Biden or Trump. Thank you.  Full disclosure: I personally oppose abortion with the exception of rape incest health of the mother or the inability of the fetus to survive outside of the womb. I support healthcare solutions such as widespread availability of free birth control for both women and men and universal healthcare. I do not support legislative solutions because frankly they dont work. I am voting for Biden/Harris.  This article is from America Magazine the Jesuit Review  POLITICS & SOCIETYFAITH AND REASON I helped write the bishops first document on Catholics and voting. Heres why Im voting Biden not Trump.  John Carr September 17 2020 (From his essay) While I understand that others will come to different conclusions my personal choice to support Vice President Biden is clear but not without reservation. To frame this judgment in the words of Faithful Citizenship I believe Mr. Trumps character lack of integrity and record on racism and Covid-19 among other matters constitute morally grave reasons to oppose his re-election. I believe Mr. Biden has the character [and] integrity to lead our nation and is more likely to pursue other authentic human goods. I will vote for Mr. Biden for what he can do to help us recover and heal lift up those left behind ensure health care for all and treat immigrants and refugees with respect. I will not vote for him to support his position on abortion but in spite of it.  (Chucks Recommendations: Biden McGrath Owensby In KY04 and Hicks KY06),political,Facebook
Its a very sad day. Nashville has a new abortion clinic that has opened today. Additionally Planned Parenthood promises to begin performing abortions again soon.  Two things: 1) Pray. Pray for the mothers/fathers the babies and for more laborers to join us in reaching these parents at the clinics. Pray that these abortion clinics are shut down for lack of business. 2) We need loving and thick skinned Christians to join us at these places to offer hope and love. Churches need to wake up and see what is happening and stand up. Babies are saved right there on the sidewalk. Only a small group of Christians across Nashville area are going on a regular basis and this is just not enough to meet the demand.  **Message us to learn how to join in this effort.  *We do not condone violence threatening language or intimidation.

In the 1800s when the court said that an African American man was only 3/5ths of a person nobody fighting for their rights thought that that was a victory.

Thanks to Pryce Robinson former chair of Boise State College Republicans for his letter of support in today's Idaho Press. In his letter Pryce mentions the issue of ObamaCare protecting human life and using taxpayer dollars to pay for abortions. Here's where I stand.  When ObamaCare was being debated here at home a decade ago I was on the ground with the U.S. Marines in Afghanistan. So my focus was elsewhere.  But let me be clear: I will fight to protect your healthcare freedom and I strongly oppose ObamaCare in any form in Idaho. Apparently one of the other primary candidates took the opposite stand in a letter to legislators back in the day. Read below.  Finally I am strongly pro-life and will fight any attempt to use your state or federal tax dollars to pay for someone else's abortion.  I'd appreciate your vote. You can get your absentee ballot application at  and the deadline for requesting it is 8:00 p.m. next Tuesday May 19th. ____________  VOTE ADAMS  Ben Adams a Marine who served two combat tours in Afghanistan is the only veteran running for state representative in District 13. Adams knows the value of life and risked his own to protect ours.  On the issues page of his campaign website Adams writes:  We are created by God and have been endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights the first of which is the Right to Life. Every life is valuable and I am an outspoken advocate for the unborn and for the expectant mothers who are caught in difficult circumstances.  He then offers a quote from President Ronald Reagan: We cannot diminish the value of one category of human life  the unborn  without diminishing the value of all human life.  But in 2012 (Kim) Keller signed a letter from the Idaho Health Exchange Alliance encouraging legislators to create a state health insurance exchange.  A state insurance exchange is the fundamental building block of ObamaCare Idaho Chooses Life said at the time warning it would help President Obama expand his attack on the sanctity of human life including a federal mandate to provide free abortifacient drugs under a health insurance exchange.  Idaho Chooses Life said the exchange posed a grave threat to the sanctity of human life including federal funds to subsidize the abortion industry in Idaho as well as abortions themselves.  Thankfully Congressman Russ Fulcher Sen. Curt McKenzie and Rep. Brent Crane heeded those warnings and voted against creating the exchange. Keller favored creating it.

When dealing with sensitive issues such as abortion it is important that the political winners learn how to win with honor and respect towards those who feel like they have lost. Abortion is front and center right about now! I have heard women speak about their right to have abortions. I have also heard women say that men should have no say so in legislating abortions or say so as to whether their child will be aborted. I hold these up as examples of one side taking a political victory too far. Let me say this I am not in agreement with the new legislation that has been passed within the pass couple of months but I understand the sentiment behind much of it. No matter how strongly you feel about a subject you must still compromise with the society as a whole. Now is the time for education and communication so that the scientific truths can be established and the rights of all parties can be accounted for. The bottom line is that abortion and the right to have one is now up in the air as to its legality. Now is time to create abortion laws that make sense not criminalize them.,political,Facebook

It alarms me how divisive this issue has become. Its emblematic of many other issues that have taken on unfair partisan frames but so much more personal and profound. Its one that as a male and someone who will never have to make such an impossible decision I feel personally unqualified to opine on. But as I am running for public office I will make my perspective clear.  I deeply feel the passion of those who seek to end abortions. Should your conviction come from your faith or from a personal belief I want to recognize that your voice matters and it is heard and felt by me. A commitment to the sanctity of life at all stages and the providing a voice for those who cannot speak for themselves  these are admirable and noble principles and should be celebrated by everyone in our community.  I do want to clarify something for those reading this: If anyone in this community has in their mind a scenario in which a person is celebrating the termination of a pregnancy I need to make it clear that their scenario does not exist. The character that is happy about an abortion or getting pregnant gladly intending on terminating the pregnancy is fictional not based on any kind of reality. Why do I say this? I say this because we need to make sure that when we talk about this important issue we all know the truth: no one wants more abortions. No one.  As I see it there are generally two approaches to lowering the number of abortions: make abortions illegal through government regulation OR provide services so that a woman does not even get into a situation where she has to make that terrible decision. Let me tell you why I support the second approach.  It works. No not just anecdotally but backed by CDC research: when public services such as sex education access to contraception and indeed quality healthcare coverage are available the number of abortions declines precipitously  more so the research suggests than even strict burdensome regulations have in recent years. So we can reasonably say that these services would be the better way to lower the number of abortions.  Using restrictive legislation to lower the number of abortions every year wouldnt only be far less effective than the approach I mention above. It also goes against so many of the principles that we value here in our district paramount among them that of freedom from unnecessary Government regulation. It seems extremely wrong to me to even dream of dictating what a woman can and cannot do with her body while a proven solution to reducing abortion numbers exists ready for widespread implementation. If we mean what we say  that fewer abortions is the true goal  then disregarding these tools would be willfully ignorant or worse yet prove us disingenuous. As we know oppressive Government regulation does not stop abortions; it simply pushes them into dangerous and deadly underground procedures.  Further still we must be clear that we have a government that is more than just pro-birth. By this I mean that before we consider getting into the business of regulating what happens to a womans body we are ensuring that the child would be raised in a society that actually cares for mother and child: legitimate maternity leave fully-funded early childhood education affordable healthcare  the list goes on. If we are pro-life then let us be pro-living. Let us give these mothers fathers and children a fair shot at health and happiness.  Before entertaining the idea of regulating womens bodies I suggest women be given the tools to which they are entitled: effective education and effective healthcare.,political,Facebook

From the desk of Bishop E.W. Jackson Sr.  Dear Fellow Americans (of African descent):  I write to you with great concern for the future of our country and the black community. Like most Americans I too am angry over the killing of George Floyd. His death was a monstrous act and former police officer Derek Chauvin deserves to have the full weight of the law brought against him. If the video we witnessed is accurate Mr. Chauvin must be imprisoned for a long time.  However my sadness reaches well beyond this single tragedy. The riots looting and violence which have occurred in cities across the country will not reform heal unify or improve the lives and safety of black Americans. In fact these actions are radically regressive and self-destructive.  Black businesses are burned down the owners are assaulted and essential grocery stores and pharmacies are destroyed. Cops and innocent bystanders are victimized and killed. The irony is that the victims are primarily those for whom the rioters claim to be seeking justice. History teaches us that communities wracked by riots and looting do not recover easily if at all. They tend to become more impoverished and dangerous than they were before the upheaval.  The Proverb says where there is no vision the people perish. The last time curfews were necessary to quell violence across the country was fifty-two years ago in 1968. A half a century later we face the same destructive reaction to racial grievance. It will not lead to one black child getting a better education. Not one black worker will get a better job and not one inner-city family will live in a safer community. If police departments are defunded as Black Lives Matter is demanding look for an outbreak of crime and violence in the inner city like nothing we have ever witnessed before.  The purpose of peaceful protests should be to secure a better life for those trapped by inner-city violence drugs gangs and lack of educational and economic opportunity. If we are having the same violent protests over the same issues with the same negative consequences as 50 years ago something is wrong with our approach.  There is a way out of this vicious cycle but it is hard medicine. Black citizens must stop voting for a political party that espouses nothing more than racial demagoguery. Al Sharpton a proven charlatan with zero credibility is trotted out to speak for the victims. No solutions are offered and no long term progress is ever made. Social and racial justice are popular slogans but they are not a strategy for improving the lives of people.  Education has been used to uplift every demographic group that has come to America. However inner-city children whose ancestors are among the earliest to arrive on this continent are trapped in failing schools. Educational choice offers a real solution but black Democratic politicians block it at every turn. They send their children to the finest schools available while leaving the children of their constituents trapped in dead-end institutions.  Their betrayal doesnt end with education. These black politicians go to church every Sunday and some of them are pastors. Yet they disregard the sin of abortion and its impact on the black community. Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger was a rabid racist who admired Adolph Hitler and consorted with the Ku Klux Klan. She would have liked to exterminate black people but satisfied herself with suppressing the growth of the black population through abortion. When eugenics proved unmarketable she changed her brand to planned parenthood which sounds benign unless you know the truth. With the full cooperation of many black leaders Sangers genocide against the black community continues to this day.  Finally the single greatest social problem facing the black community is the destruction of the nuclear family. The out-of-wedlock birth rate has exploded to 72%. In some cities such as Richmond Virginia it is 80%. The young men born to single mothers unwanted by their fathers grow up with anger and abandonment issues. Desperately wanting to be wanted they are easy recruits into a brotherhood of gangs crime and violence. The streets are an outlet for their anger.  Leftists complain that the criminal justice system tracks young black men from the school house to the jail house. But the progressive welfare policies of the Democrat Party put them on that track. Instead of encouraging stable two-parent families they incentivize single female-headed households. Theyve been doing this since the 1960s with horrific results.  Where is the plan for reversing the crisis of these communities? Where is the vision for a better future? Democratic leaders have led the black community to the brink of destruction with no hope for a better life. The black Democrat elites on the other hand experience the best America has to offer while leaving their fellow black citizens utterly hopeless.  Living posh lives these so called black leaders and their white leftist counterparts tell black voters to hate and fear Donald Trump because he is their problem. He is the enemy. His rhetoric does at times make it easy for them to mischaracterize him. Nevertheless Donald Trump has accomplished some remarkable things to benefit the black community. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) have faced financial hardship for decades and he is the first president to provide a permanent funding solution.  He established Opportunity Zones for the inner cities to help spur economic development. He presided over an economy that saw the lowest unemployment rates ever for black and Hispanic Americans. He shepherded the Criminal Justice Reform Bill through Congress correcting the legacy of the Clinton era overreaction to the crack cocaine epidemic.  President Trump is actually doing something about the problems the black community faces while Democrats do nothing.  Democrats hope that if they can keep black voters fixated on hating Donald Trump and the boogey man of racism they wont notice that the leaders they elected and the party they support are doing nothing. The voters wont notice that over 7000 young black people die in inner city violence every year. They wont notice the failing schools or the dropout rates. They wont notice the the continuing decimation of the nuclear family once the bedrock of the black community. The black Democrat politicians do not want black voters to notice that they are enriching themselves with blood money from Planned Parenthood. That organization kills around 400000 black babies every year. The black population would be double what it is today were it not for the abortion industry and the Democrats they pay to keep quiet about the genocide.  It is time for black citizens to turn away from such corrupt leaders. It is time to denounce the rioting violence and the anti-Christian philosophy of the Democratic Party which is only destroying black people.  We must come together with other citizens around a vision for the future of our community and our country that is rooted and grounded in faith. Weve come this far by faith but Democrats would have us burn the bridge that brought us over. That is suicide.  As America goes so goes the black community. Black veterans fought under the same American Flag and took the same oath to the Constitution. While they did not always receive the respect and gratitude they were due it is nonetheless true that no people of African heritage anywhere on earth are more free or better off than we who are blessed to be Americans. America is still the last best hope for all of us regardless of race.  We cannot change the past. However we can change the future. It is time to come together across all racial and cultural lines to renew the American vision of one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all. It is within our grasp if we do not allow the radical elements among us to destroy it forever. We are at the precipice. There are those who would like to push us over the cliff into chaos. They think they will be there to pick up the pieces and create a socialist utopia but history proves it will be a totalitarian nightmare.  Let us as free black Americans pull back from the precipice push back against the anarchists and embrace the legacy of freedom justice and hope for ourselves and the generations to follow.

These are all things Republicans have requested for years. Texas is behind the rest of the country on all of them leading on none. They were also watered down and not as strong as hoped for.  -The budget will grow government by tens of billions -Everyone's property taxes will continue to go up -The border is less secure thousands of illegals cross over daily -Free handouts still going to illegals -Abortion still legal and being paid for by state medicaid dollars -The power grid is still not protected -Grid does not have enough power for the coming summer -Kids can still have their genitals mutilated/chemically castrated -Men can still play in women's sports -Nothing done to address election integrity enforcement -Tax payer funded lobbying continues -Our monuments Alamo and Cenotaph were not protected  I'm furious. Texans deserve better. Texans expect better when we elect Republicans in charge of everything.  The leader of this pathetic effort of a session must be held accountable.

I oppose the death penalty. Working out of a Consistent Life Ethic I oppose any and all violence that takes a human life whether through abortion assisted suicide war capital punishment or even neglect of a neighbor. Beyond the ethical in practicality the death penalty disproportionately targets the poor the poorly educated those left injured by childhood trauma or PTSD disfavored minorities or political factions and Persons of Color. However for me as I struggle with an issue the prime arguments must be Biblical.  Supporters of the death penalty point to Genesis 9:6 Whoever sheds human blood by humans shall their blood be shed; for in the image of God has God made mankind. Thats a powerful verse but it does not stand alone. In Chapter 4 the Bible records mankinds first murder. Cain kills his brother Abel. Interestingly God does not require Cains blood in return. Instead God marks Cain in some way and banishes him from his family and friends. Cain complains that this punishment is too severe and that it would subject him to retribution wherever he might go. In a tribal society a person outside of a tribe has no protection. In response God imposes a law that if anyone (thus any tribe) kills Cain they should suffer seven deaths. The purpose for this is not to bring about seven violent deaths but that Cain should not suffer his. A constant of human nature however is that man loves a license for vengeance. By the end of the chapter a man named Lamech is telling his family that he has killed a man who wounded him. As the vengeance cycle escalates Lamech instructs his family that if the other tribe gets him they must return the violence on 77 of them.  It is in this context that God invokes Gen. 9:6. In a fallen and sinful world God must often resort to his second or third choice. (Governments also must sometimes resort to second or third choices.) Gods first choice would be a world with no murders and second that no murderer would be executed. But in a world where murder and retribution happen God commands that the execution of one will break the cycle of warring tribes. How many situations in the world today demonstrate conflicts where no one can remember who committed the first offense or where people only remember the first offense against their own party?  We are seeing this play out today in the aftermath of the Grand Jury report over the death of Breonna Taylor a woman made in the image of God. Within the context of 400 years of crimes against the Black community of lynchings of slavery and wage theft of redlining of disproportionate incarceration of guilty Whites going free and innocent Blacks suffering convictionand setting aside the details of this or any other specific casehuman nature wants to see Gen. 9:6. Without that two policemen who were not at Breonna Taylors apartment are shot. They also are made in the image of God.  As Gods image suffers these injuries it is important that God has given us a way out. Jesusthe living image of Godthrough his death on the cross shed his blood to be that man whose death returns Creation to the equilibrium that existed before that first murder and before that the first sin. Yet this only works as mankind acknowledges what Jesus has done. God also claims the exclusive right of vengeance. In Romans 12:19 after instructing believers not to repay evil with evil (v. 17) Paul says Do not take revenge my dear friends but leave room for Gods wrath for it is written: It is mine to avenge; I will repay says the Lord.  Though we are not to take revenge we are supposed to correct unjust situations. The conditions of the last 400 years cannot be allowed to continue. The first step of any spiritual breakthroughwhich is what the United States needs in 2020is repentance. Repentance is not just a say youre sorry. Repentance is a turning around and going the other way. Repentance requires a restoration. It will require some form of reparations.  But none of this can happen until all parties take a step back from violence in the streets or the threat of violence against our political systems whether that threat comes from rioters or a President who speaks of not accepting the results of an election. Various groups had previously designated September 24 as a day of fasting and prayer for our country. I will not be doing that as part of any public gathering but every day should include some prayer for our country.,political,Facebook

We seek to investigate and fund programs and studies that will seek to investigate develop and implement proven changes that minimize the loss of Black lives and improve the quality of life and opportunity in our community.

Pro-Life - Pro-Choice  Let's grab another of those 3rd rails of American politics.  I am Pro-life. I worry about the cheapening of life in our culture  especially the devaluing of human life. I look forward to the day when we treasure life again and only an insignificant number of pregnancies get terminated each year. But those are my values! I do not want others to impose their values on me and I don't have a right to impose my values on someone else. That's fundamental to Liberty.  I am Pro-Choice because I'm pro the US Constitution and its 9th 10th and 14th Amendments. I stand with the Supreme Court and Roe V. Wade. The federal government has NO right to be involved in our Healthcare decisions. A Woman's a Man's Your's or mine!  Roe v. Wade was a question of Texas law. The US Supreme looked at two issues. First did Texas law usurp the power of the Federal Government? The court held that in line with the 9th 10th and 14th amendments there is nothing in the US Constitution giving the federal government authority over personal Healthcare decisions! Second they considered if the state of Texas had the power to interfere with a private healthcare decision. They decided that although individuals have this freedom IT IS NOT ABSOLUTE and subject to some limitations. At some point the state interest as to the protection of health medical standards and pre-natal life becomes dominant. They held this is the case in the 3rd trimester. They based their decision on the body of state laws that afford pre-natal life protection of the state.  Recent changes in state laws including New York giving a pregnant female preeminence in the last trimester is well beyond the limits in Roe v. Wade. And is the state abdicating its responsibility! The federal government should assert the preeminence of the federal courts and laws when states violate or ignore them.  People have the Liberty to make their own medical decisions. I support the freedom of providers and private institutions to decide what services they will provide. I also believe the government does not have an obligation to pay the cost so a person can avail themselves of their freedom. Whether its government funding for a woman to have an abortion. Or the government paying so a person can purchase a firearm.  I am happy the number of abortions in the US is declining and will work for them to come down even more. Sadly some view human life so cheaply they can throw it away. I believe that my GOD will judge me on my decisions and will judge we of us on our individual choice. It's an issue of changing people's values and minds; and their ability to avoid unwanted pregnancy in the first place. It should not come down to reducing freedom by forcing my values on someone else. This also makes it clear that we all need to be involved in our state elections. It's in Albany that the decision was made by New York to go beyond Roe V. Wade!,political,Facebook

"REPOST FROM PASTOR CAROL CLAPPER:  I went and seen the movie Unplanned: It was not what I expected..... But is definitely a movie that needs to be seen. Abortion is murder and people need to see what really happens to a baby when it is aborted. God is a loving forgiving God If you had an abortion God loves you and will forgive you if your thinking about having an abortion please reconsider. There are so many people who would love to have a baby please consider adoption. God created us before we were in our mother's womb. PLEASE see this movie. I wonder if all the leaders of the United States watched this if it would make a difference. A baby is a baby at conception.........  Well written and in full agreement. It is not a ""Shame on you"" in your face movie to those that has had an abortion but rather exposes the truth about PLANNED PARENTHOOD.",political,Facebook
"Abortion?  I am trying hard to study scripture that preachers are using incorrectly about Elisha telling Joash to pound his bow on the ground for ""missed opportunities""! I really feel the Holy Spirit telling me it involves generational curses. So I started writing as God gave me a title and a part of the story as an analogy using perennials. Now the first half has become an explanation from the Holy Spirit about ABORTION! I will know latter if they connect but here is what God has told me so far:  ""Perennials and Parental Responsibilities""  It that time of year late winter. I receive annually all those enticing bulb magazines consisting of beautiful perennials you can purchase at a much cheaper price than buying them in the spring in full bloom! You walk in the nursery or retail store and they are everywhere. When you are a landscaper you just appreciate what makes what God created more than others as those things make bad designs even money makers!  What is really interesting most don't understand is the processes of perennials and the reason a person can be so easily tempted to buy a flower in a bulb state in the ""jumbo bulb"" size. When you walk in a nursery you can find the same plant in many different sizes. Some plants just take longer than others to grow and some people just spend more money because they have no patience or as one customer told me ""he had enough money to buy the biggest size and not enough time to wait"". Regardless of why the importance of bulbs and its bulb size is very fascinating it rewards the buyer none the less by purchasing the bigger bulb without having to know why! The bulb all year stores its energy or "" food supply"" which I am going to call a ""fortified beautiful bomb"" (bomb is a word picture for the really big bloom of your choice). The perennial doesn't do much in the winter; but it is still living and needs food kinda like a bear in hibernation. When spring comes the power of the heat and sun from God's design requires the bulb to open its fort with enough food to get the soldiers to the top of the ground (leaves) to start the year again of flower living. Every bulb will shrink from the amount needed to get into spring and get those soldiers working on photosynthesis to help prevent the fort from being completely drained before the war ( bomb throwing- see in a male world everything is a competition so you are reading about my ideology of flower competition. The flower with the biggest prettiest the most fragrant dazzling display is going to be the bomb and this WIN!). These perennials need a big fort (bigger bulb) to get that biggest bomb possible. The soldiers can not produce or store any of their efforts for the bomb because they are designed to fight only until the bomb has gone off and then they store as much as they can after that for the winter. If your a science geek or a really deep ""plantologist"" (horticulturist technically) just go with the basics and the word picture.  Now parents primarily the Father except when not there has a duty like the bulb. They can take it easy in life but the next year and each year after that it is more difficult to have a big impact on anything when there was not any efforts in storing up resources for the coming year. The blooms of every flower are their children. Children are beautiful and a blessing no matter what type of bulb it came from. For God has blessed mankind with children whom worship him and do not worship him. So when you see a flower the result is a gift from God that the parents could not stop! The horrible results of abortion do nothing more that spit on God! People have a choice not to have children but God designed the results of procreation by sexual intercourse from marriage. Thus abortion is nothing but being defiant at the design from God; AND nothing more than hating the person who designed it by harming the flower that would have shown God's glory!!  The entire world ( both saved and lost) benefits from God's blessings. Children regardless of circumstances (man's disregard from God's warnings or even a Godly servant's warning about things that could harm a child such as smoking or high dive swimming effects caused by man's own ignorance) are a product of God's design AS A BLESSING! Someone may say they don't like flowers; well then the oxygen would be a substitute for that person receiving a like word picture; but it just wasn't as poetic. 1Peter 2:3: ""If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious."" 1 Peter 2:3 KJV  The verse is not in context with the story in Chapter 2; but it does fit the application I have applied with it. A lost person can deny having been given a chance to be saved; but Romans 1 calls him a liar. Why? Because of not only the creation of God such as the trees and sky scream his existence the fruit of two humans were set in place by God's own hands in Genesis. And God said Let the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth: and it was so. And the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed after his kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind: and God saw that it was good. Genesis 1:11-12 KJV  Then further with mankind:""And God blessed them and God said unto them Be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. Genesis 1:28 KJV  All of this was in a perfect world before sin and a curse brought about sickness and bad of any kind. For it was man who put his fingers in the light socket and turned a great thing into death! Children like flowers are from God. Somebody that does not want something that came from a perfect sinless non-cursed world only HATES THAT CREATOR; as if he or she could have made it better!",political,Facebook

On August 1 the Arkansas State Association of Free Will Baptists approved a Resolution to Abolish Abortion in our state (The Resolution can be read at the end of this article). The Free Will Baptists possess a rich heritage of relieving the suffering of their fellow man having been involved in abolishing slavery during the 1800s in America.  Following in that tradition we recognize the suffering of our fellow image bearers of God who are being taken down to death by the detestable practice of human abortion.  Among other statements the Resolution recognizes that every human being is made in the image of God and possesses innate dignity that equal justice should be established for all of Gods image bearers that failing to provide equal protection under the law violates Gods standard of justice that abortion is a gospel issue and that whenever mans laws conflict with those of the Almighty civil legislators have a right and an obligation to obey God instead of man.  We encourage you to follow Christ in this endeavor and to ask your state representative and state senator to support the IMMEDIATE and TOTAL abolition of abortion in Arkansas.  Call your state representative at 501.682.7771. Search for your state rep here:  Call your state senator at 501.682.6107.

(Rom 2:14-16; Gen 3:1) and  (4) WHEREAS to murder any preborn image-bearer is a sin violating both the natural law of retributive justice as set forth in the Noahic covenant as well as the sixth commandment forbidding murder and as such is ultimately an assault on Gods image seeking to usurp Gods sovereignty as Creator (Gen 9:5-6; Exodus 20:13; Prov 6:17) and  (5) WHEREAS Gods Word clearly declares that all human life is a sacred gift and that His Law is supreme over mans life and mans law (Psalms 127:3-5; 139:13-16; Rom 2:15-16; Acts 10:42; 17:31; 1 Corinthians 4:5) and  (6) WHEREAS God commands His own people to rescue those who are being taken away to death and holds them responsible and without excuse when they fail to do so (Prov 24:11-12) and  (7) WHEREAS God establishes all governing authorities as His avenging servants to carry out His wrath on the evildoer; and commands these authorities to judge justly neither showing partiality to the wicked nor using unequal standards which are abominations (Psa 82; Rom 13:4) and  (8) WHEREAS in 1973 the Supreme Court of the United States rendered an iniquitous decision in Roe v. Wade and in doing so deprived the innocent of their rights and usurped God who sovereignly ordained their authority (Isa 5:23; 10:1-2; Psa 2; Matt 22:21; John 19:11; Acts 4:19; 5:29 Rom 13:1) and  (9) WHEREAS in the Roe v. Wade decision the Supreme Court of the United States subverted the U.S. Constitution namely the Preamble as well as the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments without any legal authority as likewise reflected in Article II Sections 8 and 21 of the Arkansas Constitution (US Constitution Article 6 Clause 2 Supremacy Clause) and  (10) WHEREAS governing authorities at every level have a duty before God to uphold justice asserting their God-ordained and constitutional authority to establish equal protection under the law for all born and preborn by intervening ignoring or nullifying iniquitous decisions when other authorities condone such injustices as the legal taking of innocent life (Daniel 3; 1 Kings 12; 2 Kings 11; Jeremiah 26:10-16; 36:9-31; 37:11- 21; 39:7-10) and  (11) WHEREAS over the past 48 years with 60+ million abortions traditional Pro-life laws though well intended have not established equal protection and justice for the preborn but on the contrary have established incremental regulatory guidelines for when where why and how to obtain legal abortion of innocent preborn children thereby legally sanctioning abortion and  (12) WHEREAS our repentance is lacking as we as the Body of Christ have historically stopped short of calling for the immediate abolition of abortion without exception or compromise and  (13) WHEREAS we are mandated by Scripture to speak on behalf of the unborn and contend for the sanctity of all human life from conception to natural death now be it therefore  (14) RESOLVED that the Arkansas Free Will Baptist Association having a rich history of being instrumental in abolishing human suffering do state unequivocally that abortion is murder and we reject any position that allows for any exceptions to the legal protection of our preborn neighbors compromises Gods holy standard of justice or promotes any God-hating partiality (Psa 94:6; Isa 10:1-2; Prov 24:11; Psa 82:1-4) and be it further  (15) RESOLVED that we will not embrace an incremental approach to ending abortion because it challenges Gods Lordship over the heart and the conscience and rejects His call to repent of sin completely and immediately (Gen 3:1; John 8:44; Rom 2:14-15; 2 Corinthians 11:3) and be it further  (16) RESOLVED that we affirm that the murder of preborn children is a crime against humanity that must be punished equally under the law and be it further  (17) RESOLVED that we humbly confess and repent of our complicity in recognizing any exceptions that legitimize or regulate abortion and of our apathy in not laboring with the power and influence we have to abolish abortion and be it further  (18) RESOLVED that as Free Will Baptists we will engage with Gods help in establishing equal justice and protection for the preborn according to the authority of Gods Word as well as local and federal law and call upon pastors and entity leaders to use their God-given gifts of preaching teaching and leading with one unified principled prophetic voice to abolish abortion and be it finally  (19) RESOLVED that because abolishing abortion is a gospel issue we will call upon governing authorities at all levels to repent and obey everything that [Christ] has commanded exhorting them to bear fruit in keeping with repentance by faithfully executing their responsibilities as Gods servants of justice and working with all urgency to enact legislation using the full weight of their office to interpose on behalf of the preborn abolishing abortion immediately without exception or compromise (Mark 6:18; Matt 28:18-20; Rom 13:4 6).,political,Facebook

You cant be Christian and support abortion. If you do support abortion and claim to be Christian you are a false witness. Im pretty sure if you kill a woman that is pregnant to any degree you get charged for a double murder. And if you kill a baby as soon as their bodies hit the air essentially you are declared a murderer by law. We need to start calling it what it is. Murder. We have become such watered down Christians seeking the prosperity but avoiding the persecution. You choose to be friends of this world which makes you an enemy of God.,political,Facebook
Official press release: For Immediate Release:  Liedtky to Wesco: Apologize for Diminishing Deaths of 3500 Hoosiers  Indianas State House race between incumbent Tim Wesco and challenger Ryan Liedtky has grown more intense as we head to the final month of this election cycle. On Thursday Tim Wesco diminished the deaths of 3500 Hoosiers who lost their lives to COVID-19 by insinuating it is more important we talk about smoking than an on-going pandemic. Liedtky called for Rep. Wesco to apologize to those families as well as all the families who have lost jobs struggled with paying their bills and suffered mental and emotional pain due to the ongoing crisis.  We mourn for all loss of life Liedtky said. We want to see an end to all deaths caused by smoking and secondhand smoke. That is why we enact laws that ban smoking in cars with children ban smoking within 8 feet of public entrances and require businesses post signage to indicate they allow smoking.  Liedtky then suggested that he not Wesco is the true pro-life candidate. When a person does not want to take common sense measures to pro-long and preserve life they cannot be considered pro-life regardless of their stance on abortion. Because I believe in these common sense measures on smoking and COVID and because I believe in helping every Hoosier ensure they have access to healthcare food and housing I am the only candidate who values life at every stage.  Liedtky then called out poor leadership in Indiana government. Unfortunately we have not seen great leadership at many levels through this. We have seen policy men who cannot adapt to the challenges that lay ahead and who fail to give guidance to those who seek it.  Liedtky concluded by stating I believe in the America that loves us protects us serves us welcomes us comforts us guides us and unites us.,political,Facebook

"On Abortion.  A woman is responsible for making sure her body doesn't become pregnant. Period.  Adulting is hard...  We no longer live in the Middle-Ages. 1961 was the ""Year Of The Pill"" and brought reproductive choice to women. Accidental pregnancy is simply a lack of reproductive responsibility.  A pregnant women forfeits some of the rights to her body because it's no longer just HER body. By the nature of mammalian birth a baby has no choice but to be born in such a way and should be protected by the same law that guarantees ""life liberty and the pursuit of happiness"" that are unalienable to all humans.  And the baby carries 50% of the father's DNA; where are his rights? Eggs don't fertilize themselves 'ya know! Abortion should require the father's consent. Equality has to go both ways otherwise can it even be called equality??  Ninety-One days is plenty of time for a woman and man to decide if they are ready to have a baby and exercise their choice of abortion. There is zero logic for abortion past the first trimester.

With no emergency action from the Supreme Court to block S.B. 8 yet abortion is now nearly impossible for patients to access in Texas. This extreme ban is unconstitutional and abhorrent. 85-90% of abortions performed in Texas are at least six weeks into pregnancy.  Many people dont even know theyre pregnant at six weeks. This law will more heavily effect those who dont have the ability to travel or take time off of work to obtain an abortion. Because of the legacy of systemic racism in the US that will likely be Black and brown people.  80% of Americans support safe legal abortions and want abortion to be legal. This is an all time high and yet abortion access is being attacked more than ever. This ban is a political whim not the will of the American people.

Battle Cry for Men  I wasnt sure if I would ever get the opportunity to become a father. I had laid out a series of goals that I wanted to accomplish throughout my life and in them happened to be get married and have children. I was prepared to throw all of my time effort and money into accomplishing them. What I wasnt prepared for however was that I would have the opportunity to hold two babies who call me dad.  Ive noticed that for most of us fathers develop a heightened sense of protectiveness when it comes to the security and well-being of their children. If youre like me you run through scenarios in your head trying to prepare for situations that might arise. The best we can we put up our fatherly fence of pretection. This feeling to protect that we have built inside us doesnt just apply to our own children but often strangers and their children. If something were to happen in front of us we may have an urge to intervene. God wired us to protect that which he gave us dominion over.  The funny thing is as good as we think we are at protecting we are actually pretty terrible at it. We have sat back and let the world deteriorate around us. What is right has become relative and we sit back and shake our heads. In our minds we can probably picture ourselves somehow running to the rescue and righting all of the wrongs. It never works out like it does in the movies though. Why is it that we sometimes see wrong and do not act? Why do we not intervene on behalf of those who cant fight for themselves?  I would argue that although our intentions are good until a situation directly has an effect on us we ignore it. We permit it to happen in the background until we can no longer stand it. This is where I am. This is where I also hope you are. The threat of evil that would convince us that it is ok to murder unborn babies purely out of inconvenience makes terrorism look like a birthday party. I understand that there are situations that could cause one to consider abortion under very difficult circumstances. Those situations however make up a fraction of the abortions that are performed in the world. No matter your position on those situations I cannot fathom how we can sit back and watch as helpless babies are put to death.  We as men are told today that we have no opinion when it comes to the subject of abortion. We have been told that it is the womans body carrying the baby and therefore we have no say. It is unfortunate that todays society and popular culture try to emasculate us into thinking that we have no say in the lives of our children. We are told to hush by political movements so we back down. We are called out by our companies coworkers friends family and strangers if we say anything to the contrary. My question to you this. How much more are you willing to sit back and watch before you are willing to take a stand? Are we really willing to permit the murder of innocent babies in the name of political correctness? Make no mistake this is a battle that transcends what our eyes can see.  It is time to start the process of ending this. We have a duty as men to protect these innocent children as best we can. There is strength in numbers and there is strength in a common goal. Join me today in praying for the next steps. Join me today in figuring out how we can stand up as men to stop this from continuing.  More coming soon,political,Facebook

"Matthew 6:24 You've got to choose between God and money. Matthew 7:14 says there is a narrow gate into Heaven Jesus' Words and a wide path to Hell. Choose where you will go today. In the end the Bible says many will call Jesus' Name and He will say ""I never knew you depart from Me you workers of iniquity. "" These are Jesus' Words not mine. If you check the Bible Jesus talked about Hell being a real place where you don't want to go. He preached on the existence of Hell more than anyone else in the Bible. Check it or ignore it. You choose! Jesus never had a lot of money in the bank or lived the ""good life"" or owned a mansion on earth so why should you think you should be rich in fact Jesus said YOU MUST CHOOSE EITHER GOD OR MONEY EITHER ONE OR THE OTHER NOT BOTH. Luke 6:24. Why do you think you deserve to live in a mansion and have the ""good life"" when Jesus didn't? do you think you are better than Jesus that Jesus ""talks just to hear Himself talk?"" As Jesus commanded the rich young ruler ""sell all you have and give it to the poor and follow Him"" before it is too late. We live in a time where in China they are mixing animal and baby DNA and yet these evolutionists say we ""come from animals."" It doesn't make sense to anyone with common sense' but this is how deluded people's minds can become when God turns them over to delusion for having zero regard for Jesus Christ! You know most people's God is their belly. They are too interested in sex and a six pack and the next sporting event than to notice that the Real Id will be a requirement in October 2020 or to think about the Corona virus and wonder why it happened to originate in China a country that actively persecutes Christians a country that only gave ""3 years"" in prison to the doctor who mixed animal and embryo DNA a country that has a ""social score"" citizen surveillance system in place to grade it's citizens on how ""good a citizen they are"" a precursor to the Mark system mentioned in the Book of Revelation. It's coming. In our nation 60 million or so innocent babies have been murdered by abortion we have kicked God and prayer from schools and courtrooms and we don't think that God will judge us for it? This message will probably get no likes or only a few because most are asleep and it would take a sledgehammer to break into their heart to get at where they live. I've worked with Pro-life on the front lines for 20 years so I can talk if the murder of 60 million innocent babies doesn't move you I worry about your soul. God says we can know the season of His return though we cannot know the Day or the Hour. Jerusalem became a nation in 1948 after 2000 years of not having a nation already they have completed the Worship items for the rebuilding of the final temple. I'm not an alarmist but as the Bible predicts today with the advent of the Internet God's Word has been preached in every corner of the world a prophesy which people couldn't conceive of being fulfilled even 50 years ago. Today people ""run to and fro"" more than ever due to the invention of the jet in 1939 and today we as the Bible predicts ""call good evil and evil good "" Schools kick prayer out and the Bible out but let Harry Potter which teaches sorcery and witchcraft in and LGBTQ courses in while people seem to be distracted by the next meaningless trinket and the next sporting event. Jesus IS coming! Be ready! The Bible says He will come in the ""twinkling of an eye"" Persecution of Christians is coming to America and we will all have to make a choice whether to choose God and be persecuted for our Faith or choose the ""world system"" and take the Mark of the antichrist. The Bible says in the Book of Revelation that anyone who takes the Mark will suffer eternal damnation. Choose today where you will spend eternity... -Richard @theFaithBelievers",political,Facebook
The Final Solution - Charlie's Soapbox 2/1/19  In the early stages of the Second World War Hitler intent on totally exterminating the Jews came up with a plan the Nazis code named the Final Solution.  Buchenwald Auschwitz Dachau Treblinka concentration camps were set up to systematically import incarcerate and exterminate the Jews of Europe.  There are those out there who will deny that the Holocaust ever happened but Im here to tell you that it did happen I remember the newsreels from my early youth that showed bulldozers pushing thousands of naked emaciated bodies of dead Jews into mass graves like so much garbage.  There were six million Jews murdered by the Nazis in gas chambers mass shootings and any other kind of monstrous methods of death these demonic animals could come up with.  Horrible right? Could never happen in the United States of America right?  Wrong.  This past week Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York signed into law a bill that is every bit as evil and just as satanically inspired as Hitlers Final Solution a bill that allows abortion up to the time the child comes through the birth canal.  If you think thats not cruel enough if a baby designated to be aborted somehow makes it through the abortion process alive the protections that were previously in place to protect the child that survived have been removed.  And wait another minute abortions in New York can be performed by people other than doctors!  Governor Ralph Northam of Virginia has just gone New York one better defending a totally barbaric piece of legislation proposed by radical abortion proponents.  He said If a mother is in labor I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if thats what the mother and the family desired and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother. So a living breathing human being alive and living on its own outside the womb could be legally murdered if the mother wishes.  Under the proposed Virginia bill Kermit Gosnell - the abortion doctor who is currently serving three life sentences in Pennsylvania for killing babies that survived the abortion process - would be a free man today.  Governor Northam tried to walk his statement back and clarify that he was speaking about birth defects.  Thank God the Virginia bill failed to pass but the supporters have the support of the governor and theyll undoubtedly be back.  No longer can the blob of flesh theory be defended no longer can the Its not really a baby lie be told now its infanticide plain simple and evil wicked an ungodly service to the prince of darkness innocence sacrificed on the altar of sexual convenience and political expediency.  A womans right to choose has turned into a womans right to play God knowingly allowing the death of what cannot be denied as a living fully-formed human being.  With one stroke of his pen Andrew Cuomo has stripped the protections for abortion survivors in New York State and Democrats basically support doing the same thing in Virginia but take it to the next level.  Is this what the once noble Democratic Party has turned into? Is there not one influential man or woman Democrat that will step forth and denounce this hellish madness.  How do the legislators who voted for this evil and the governors who sign it manage even a minutes sleep at night?  If a seed has the potential to become a tree if an egg has the potential to become an eagle there is absolutely no denying that life begins at conception and common sense tells you that abortion at any stage of pregnancy is tantamount to murder but what has happened in New York and Virginia has gone beyond the pale of anything civilized people would allow.  And before you abortion apologists - finger poised over the keyboard to condemn me for what I have written and vehemently believe - let me tell you this.  I am not your judge He is waiting behind the final veil at the end of the road we must all walk where we will all appear and give account for the things we have done while on this earth and we will all stand there with no place to hide where the verdicts are final and eternal and there is no appeal.  Before I formed you in your mothers womb I knew you. - Jeremiah 1:5  For what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul. - Mark 8:36  The infallible unchanging eternal Word of the living God.  The most awesome of thoughts.  What do you think?  Pray for our troops our police and the peace of Jerusalem.  God Bless America  Charlie Daniels,political,Facebook
"In the last two election cycles Congressman Bobby Scott (D-VA) has been the only candidate on the ballot. It's time for change; it's time for a person of unquestionable integrity to represent the 3rd District.  Bobby Scott is a man who puts politics over principle; his integrity is questionable. He compromised it by (admittedly) withholding information about a sexual assault that could have hurt the Lieutenant Governor Fairfax's campaign. He decided that getting Fairfax elected was more important than justice for this woman.  What has he accomplished for our district? Bobby Scott has been in Congress since 1992 and has no major accomplishment other than his staunch support for abortion on-demand through a womans entire pregnancy. He supports prohibiting basic life-sustaining support for babies born alive during a botched abortion. Its time for him to go - along with every other ""career"" politician.  Why should you vote for me? Well Im not your typical Republican; I will never give up my integrity for political gain. I am honest and forthright and will never place politics over principle. I will fight for school choice balanced budgets; I will never support any type of corporate welfare; I will support farm subsidies for family farms not huge corporations; I will propose new laws to help the working poor and prevent them from losing all of their benefits as they increase their pay.  Other Republicans are planning to run as well. The reason I am the best candidate is that I have extensive expertise in National Security as a Marine federal civilian employee and consultant. I have worked for several agencies in the Intelligence Community; I have the experience to develop meaningful questions to ask anyone from those agencies testifying before Congress.  Having worked at United States Citizenship & Immigration Services (USCIS) I understand what Congress must do to ensure we prevent people associated with terrorism from becoming refugees or immigrants. This is very costly in terms of both time and money but if implemented correctly will save American lives.  I need your help. To run a competitive campaign I need at least $250000. If everyone who has told me they support my candidacy could contribute to the campaign we will remain competitive for the Republican nomination.  Please consider contributing today -- or hosting a small fundraising event. We also need individual volunteers to help get the required signatures of registered voters as well.  If you can help in any way please use the contact form on our website (www.collickforcongress) or send me an email (john@collick4congress.com) to let us know. Thank you.

Today I want to officially endorse Micah Beckwith For Congress. I believe he is the only candidate of choice. If you are looking for a candidate with a backbone of steel who will take YOUR voice to congress and not lobbyists voice to you. Vote Micah Beckwith on May 5th.  1) If you are Pro-Life and outraged that 41 democratic senators value human life so little that they won't protect a child who is born during a botched abortion and you want someone who will FIGHT for the unborn vote Micah Beckwith.  2) If you are tired of your constitutional rights being trampled on by corrupt politicians and increased legislation whether it be your second amendment rights freedom of speech freedom of religion or any other right you have and you want someone who will fight to protect our God given rights as American citizens vote Micah Beckwith.  3) If you are tired of being bludgeoned to death by an increased tax burden whether rich middle class or poor and are terrified Bernie Sanders will come in and take all your hard earned money vote Micah Beckwith. He is THE candidate who believes in a smaller more fiscal government AND wants to decrease everyone's tax liability.  4) There are a million reasons to cast your vote SOLELY for Micah Beckwith but the one many of us care about most is keeping our freedom of religion protected. I am a Christian and love God and don't want to be persecuted for my faith. Freedom of religion is important to me as it is too many. Whether you are Christian Muslim Jew Hindu or any other faith Micah has VOWED to protect our first amendment right in freedom of speech and religion. Again the only responsible vote on May 5th is Micah Beckwith.  If you have any questions let me know.  Sincerely  James Peters Your Freedom Fighting Patriot,political,Facebook

AFTER THE 2021 OFF YEAR ELECTIONS  The 2021 off-year elections showed the continuing appeal of American nationalist themes previously exhibited in on the congressional side of the 2020 elections. However the divisive methods of appealing to this pride resulted in close races where almost all the victors won narrowly. The use of emotional dog-whistles like critical race theory or former President Trumps responsibility for the January 6 insurrection obscures the issues that we must face to truly build a strong America.  As I mentioned in this previous post we have been in such politically divisive days before and survived to renew our civil political culture. In post-Civil War 19th century politics the real social and economic dislocations caused by the Industrial Revolution were obscured by campaigns about the tangential issues of alcohol temperance religion and responsibility for the Civil War or Rum Romanism & Rebellion as it was called by one observer. Similar red herrings are used by todays political propagandists to distract us from the real issues. The modern equivalent of Rum is the abortion and other social issues which distract us from discussing the real crises faced by todays families attempting to raise moral and successful children. Instead of warnings about the supposed religious threat of Romanism we now focus on woke politics critical race theory and other ethnic grievances rather than improving the education of our children to insure they can compete in the world workforce. Finally the constant harping over the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol enables our leaders to avoid addressing the sources of the extremism on both sides that justifies political violence (see this previous post).  Two years ago this website was started to cut through these emotional dog-whistles used by extremists on both sides by highlighting the real issues that weaken the America and its people in an age of rising nationalism elsewhere. I believed the way Theodore Roosevelt guided us out of the political abyss of the late 19th century was a model for curing the fevered politics of these times. He like us all was never perfect in his actions (see this post) but he was a pioneer of his time on them. Over the next year and in preparation for the next election we will continue to help you identify the true issues facing America and act on them. For example we will develop a new American Nationalist Voting Index you can use to evaluate your local congressional candidates in the upcoming 2022 elections. There will also be some changes in the structure of the website including a new subscription service that will deliver website posts right to your e-mail box.  Thank you for your attention and support for the website. It is my goal to continue to inform you on how you can preserve a strong America and the American Dream.

"WANT TO KNOW WHY WE ARE VOTING FOR TRUMP! IT'S YOU!.  If you are a liberal who cant stand Trump and cannot possibly fathom why conservatives would ever vote for him let me finally fill you in.  Its not that we love Donald Trump so much. Its that we cant stand you. And we will do whatever it takes  even if that means electing a rude obnoxious unpredictable narcissist (your words-not ours) to the office of President of the United States  because the only thing we find more dangerous to this nation than Donald Trump is you.  How is that possible you might ask? Well you have done everything in your power to destroy our country from tearing down the police to tearing down our history to tearing down our borders. You are systematically destroying our schools and brainwashing our kids into believing socialism is the answer to anything (despite being an unmitigated failure everywhere) while demonizing religion and faith and glorifying abortion violence and thug culture.  From calling us racists every time we expect everyone of any skin color to follow our laws equally to telling us that our tolerance of lifestyles we dont agree with isnt nearly enough....no we must celebrate any lifestyle choice or gender option (forget science) you throw our direction or you think its fine to calls us homophobic or some other degrading slur  and ironically all while lecturing us on hate speech. While you gaslight us about 52 genders polyamory grown men in dresses sharing public locker rooms with little girls and normalize the sexualization of young children you simultaneously ridicule us for having the audacity to wish someone a Merry Christmas or hang a flag on the 4th of July stand for the national anthem or (horror or horrors) don a MAGA hat in public. So much for your tolerance. Do you see why we think you are hypocrites??  Were also not interested in the fact that you think you can unilaterally decide that 250 years of the right-to-bear-arms against a tyrannical or ineffective government should be abolished because you cant get the violence in the cities you manage under control. Free-speech should be tossed out the window history erased and those who disagree with your opinions are fair game for public harassment or doxing. Spoiled children with nose-rings and tats who still live off their parents dime should be allowed to destroy cities and peoples livelihoods without repercussions. That chaos and lawlessness and disrespect for authority should be the norm. This is your agenda. And you wonder why we find you more dangerous than Donald Trump?  Your narrative is a constant drone of oppressor/oppressed race-baiting intended to divide the country in as many ways as you possibly can. You love to sell victim-hood to people of color every chance you get because its such an easy sell compared to actually teaching people to stand on their own two feet and take personal responsibility for their own lives their own communities and their own futures. But you wont do that. You will never do that because then you will lose control over people of color. They might actually start thinking for themselves God forbid!  This is why we will vote for Donald Trump.It is not because he is the most charming character on the block nor because he is the most polite politician to have ever graced the oval office. It is not because he is the most palatable choice not that we love his moral character or because he never lies. It is because we are sick to death of you and all of the destructive crap you are doing to this once beautiful and relatively safe country. Your ineffective and completely dysfunctional liberal leadership(?) has literally destroyed our most beautiful cities our public education system and done its damndest to rip faith out of peoples lives.  However bad Donald Trump may be (and he is far from perfect) every day we look at you and feel that no matter what Donald Trump says or does there is no possible way he could be any worse for our country than you people are.  We are sick to death of your stupid destructive ignorant and intolerant behavior and beliefs  parading as wokeness. We are beyond sick of your hypocrisy and B.S. We are fed up with your disrespectful divisiveness and constant unrelenting harping and whining and complaining (while you live in the most privileged nation in the world) while making literally zero contributions of anything positive to our society. Your entire focus is on ripping things down never ever building anything up. Think about that as there is something fundamentally very wrong in the psychology of people who choose destruction as their primary modus operandi.  If Donald J Trump is reelected rather than blame us look in the mirror and blame yourselves. Because you are the ones that are responsible for the rise of Donald Trump. You are the ones who have created this monster that you so despise by your very actions your refusal to respect your fellow Americans and the things that are important to us.  You have made fun of the fly-over states the people who cling to their guns and religion the middle class factory workers and coal miners and underprivileged rural populations that you dismissively call yahoos and deplorables. You have mocked our faith and our religion. You have mocked our values and our patriotism. You have trampled our flag and insulted our veterans and treated our first responders with contempt and hatred.  You have made environmentalism your religion while trashing every city you have taken responsibility for. You scream from the rooftops about global warming and a green new deal while allowing tens of thousands of homeless people to cover your streets in literal garbage needles and plastic waste without doing a single thing to help them solve the environmental crisis that your failed social policies are creating. But were supposed to put YOU in charge of the environment while gutting our entire economy to institute this plan when you cant even clean up a single city?? You complain  endlessly  yet have failed to solve a single social problem anywhere. In fact all you have done is create more of them.  Weve had enough. We are tired of quietly sitting by and being the silent majority. So dont be surprised when the day comes when we finally respond. And trust me its coming sooner than you might think. And also trust me when I say it wont be pretty. Get ready.  If Donald Trump is reelected it will be because you and your comrades have chosen to trash the police harass law-abiding citizens and go on rampages destroying public property that we have all paid for and you have zero respect for.  If Donald Trump is reelected it will be because we are sick of your complete and utter nonsense and destruction. How does it feel to know that half of this country finds you FAR more despicable than Donald J. Trump the man you consider to be the anti-Christ? Let that sink in. We consider you to be more despicable more dangerous more stupid and more narcissistic than Donald Trump. Maybe allow yourself a few seconds of self-reflection to let that sink in. This election isnt about Donald Trump vs. Joe Biden. This is about Donald Trump vs. YOU.  So if on the morning of November 4 (or more likely December 29 by the time the Supreme Court will weigh in on the mail-in ballot fiasco we are headed towards) if Donald J. Trump is reelected the only people you have to blame is the left-wing media drones and yourselves. You did this. Yep you!""  Time to walk away! BY- ANONYMOUS",political,Facebook

The poll found that 31% of Americans who believe in The Creator feel strongly that the virus is a sign telling humanity to change with the same number feeling that somewhat.  Evangelical Protestants are more likely than others to believe that strongly at 43% compared with 28% of Catholics and mainline Protestants. My idea is the world is mostly pro abortion or not protesting it. Since the U.S. killed 60 million babies from 1973 till now on. They deserve the virus and more the dirty Bastards.

Primarying conservative democrats should be of utmost priority for progressives. My opponent in this race voted to take healthcare away from women. He voted to have the government intervene in a womans life. He voted to ban dilation and evacuation and to take the first step into making Kansas the first abortion free state. -- Thank god the Kansas supreme court intervened and ruled that an unconstitutional law.  Since 2015 state lawmakers (like my opponent) have begun to target the abortion method most commonly used in the second trimester dilation and evacuation (D&E). Banning D&E is one of several trends to emerge from among the recent onslaught of state abortion restrictions and the idea is rooted in a long history of efforts to limit access to abortion after the first trimester by enacting restrictions on specific abortion methods.  By restricting the most common method of second-trimester abortion policymakers hostile to abortion would take a significant step forward in their campaign to eliminate abortion access in the United States. As with most abortion restrictions the consequences would fall hardest on those already struggling to obtain access to abortion.  The women of Kansas need a #ProChoice champion who is going to advocate for their bodily autonomy. I hope you will stand with Aaron and vote Coleman August 4th.  #YesWeKansas #AaronForKansasHouse37 #ksleg  Thank you!,political,Facebook
While Socialism is generally considered to be the antithesis of Conservatism there is a case to be made by Paternalistic Conservatives for a socialistic economy. Socialism advocates for the welfare and prosperity of all human beings through control of the means of production by the labor force and the abolition of the free-market economy with its boom and bust cycle. While the free-market economy has led to great advances in human progress it has left many millions of people both in the United States and the rest of the world destitute by allowing a few to control the flow of capital and deprive the many of the full fruits of their labor. Its boom and bust cycle leaves millions exposed to hardship when the market collapses. By abolishing the free market and democratizing ownership of the means of production and by implementing controls on prices and production Socialism eliminates the risk factor inherent to free-market economies and ensures that all laborers can enjoy the fruits of their labor. Paternalistic Conservatives especially those who adhere to the teachings of Jesus Christ should consider Socialism as a necessary replacement for our Capitalist economy. This page advocates for a new form of socialism which allows for private ownership of property and more direct labor ownership of production and services rather than en-masse nationalization of production. For example this pages plan for electric utilities is not to form a single national system owned wholly by the government but rather to break up private electric utilities into regional user-owned cooperatives. Franklin Delano Roosevelts Rural Electrification Act set the precedent for this in this country; the legacy of the REA remains in the form of numerous regional electric cooperatives across the United States. However the majority of electric utilities in this country remain in private hands and this page advocates for these private utilities to be turned into user-owned cooperatives. On the front of agriculture this page advocates for all farms to be in the hands of family farmers rather than the more typical Socialist collective farms. This page also advocates for the breakup of corporate-owned farms and for them to be handed over to individual owners. State-controlled cooperatives would collect the majority of agricultural goods in order to be distributed domestically or to be sold or distributed abroad; members of the cooperative would then be reimbursed according to the amount which they produced. Farmers would also have the option to sell up to 25 percent of their production directly to retailers subject to variation based on the type of agricultural good. We advocate for private control of most retail with workers having fair representation on the boards of all companies in the field; in addition retailers would be subject to state-issued price controls and sales guidelines. More details on the economic plan this page advocates for will be discussed further in later posts. Finally this page advocates for socially conservative values such as an emphasis on the traditional nuclear family abolition of abortion discouragement of sexual immorality temperance nullification of homosexual civil unions banning of obscenity and freedom of speech thought religion and the press. This page also advocates for full equality of all citizens regardless of sex ethnicity sexual orientation religion or political affiliation. In addition we advocate for mandatory ownership of firearms by all households for defense against enemies both foreign and domestic. This page also advocates for the replacement of democracy with a paternalistic dictatorship of the proletariat subject to a restrictive constitution and the American Bill of Rights of 1791. In conclusion we believe that Socialism is fully compatible with Conservatism and with Christianity as well as with American founding ideals and we hope to encourage the establishment of a Socialist system in the United States of America.,political,Facebook
"Dear Fellow Patriot. Is Elaine Luria Nancy Pelosi's and the gun-grabbers' favorite U.S. Congresswoman? Elaine Luria is endorsed by the anti-gun Giffords organization. And Michael Bloomberg spent nearly a half-million dollars to elect Rep. Luria. Pelosi's network of PACs dumped in millions to help turn this deep red seat blue during the 2018 midterms. But it doesn't have to stay that way! With Elaine Luria running for re-election this year this is our perfect opportunity to unseat her!  Let me say it again. Elaine Luria is Nancy Pelosi's and Michael Bloomberg's favorite U.S. Representative and we have a chance to DEFEAT her.  I have a plan but I'll need your help to get it done. But first let me explain just how much is on the line. Because you see Elaine Luria is a critical piece of the Democrats' plot to block every conservative reform on President Trump's agenda. Not only that but House Democrats are STILL talking about their failed impeachment hoax. Right now the Republican majority in the U.S. House majority is currently held by Democrats and they are not letting up. They are determined to build on the momentum of their victories in the recent mid-term elections. Every subsequent loss we suffer at the hands of the Democrats lowers our chances of creating lasting conservative change during the Trump Presidency. And with the Republican Senate Majority at a bare 51 seats things are growing desperate. The Democrats are counting on their favorite gun-grabbing House Rep. to hold onto this traditionally Republican seat while they try to win 4 Republican U.S. Senate seats up for grabs in November. You see it's vital Virginians win back this seat and take his political power off the board. And I'm the man to do it. I need your help to do it. But first let me tell you a bit more about myself. My name is Jarome Bell. Im an America First conservative Navy Veteran and high school football coach running for Congress to fight with President Trump to put America First. I am the proud father to three children and I've been married for 23 years and counting. I am a U.S. Navy veteran of 27 years where I flew more than 9000 hours as a Naval Air Crewman. As a Candidate for U.S. House I'm fighting in this campaign to protect Virginians from Elaine Luria's big-government left-wing agenda. And as a U.S. Congressman I WILL fight to protect the Constitutional rights of Virginians at a national level. Democrats have voted to keep ObamaCare. I will lead the fight to roll back ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion in Virginia -- even against the will of several in party leadership. Where Elaine Luria votes with Pelosi to give Planned Parenthood millions in taxpayer dollars I will vote to defund Planned Parenthood. Where Elain Luria has voted with billionaire gun-grabber Michael Bloomberg for gun control I will continue to fight for our Second Amendment rights. Ultimately Elaine Luria votes in lock-step with Nancy Pelosi's progressive agenda EVERY TIME -- and I'm ready for that to end. But we need a Republican who can defeat Nancy Pelosi and Elaine Luria. ________________________________________ ""Our country desperately needs courageous leaders like Jarome Bell to stand up to the establishment in Washington.""

I know that may be a sacrifice for you but we can't afford to have a representative as liberal as Pelosi's pal Elaine Luria. You see pro-abortion groups NARAL and Planned Parenthood Action rate Elaine Luria at 100% in lock-step with their pro-abortion agenda. After taking nearly $500000 of Bloomberg's dirty money Luria no doubt wears her 'F' rating from the NRA like a badge of honor. The Heritage Foundation rated Luria's record go so far left that they rank her at 00.00% -- one of the most liberal scores in the U.S. House! You heard that right Elaine Luria is more liberal than nearly every other Democrat in the U.S. House. So please chip in with your donation of $100 or $50 today to send Pelosi's and Bloomberg's favorite House Rep. packing! If you're reading the headlines then you already know conservatives like you are uniting to back my race against Elaine Luria. My defense of the Second Amendment in Virginia's Second Amendment Sanctuary Movement racked up hundreds of thousands of total views from conservatives nationwide. And I've garnered support from noted conservatives like Rep. Paul Gosar and Michelle Malkin both of whom have endorsed my race to defeat Elaine Luria. The bottom line is this: I'm the Republican candidate most likely to beat Elaine Luria head-to-head in November! It's clear my campaign is uniting Virginia conservatives to defeat Elaine Luria. But I need support from patriots like you to mount the campaign necessary to unseat him. We already know that Elaine Luria has Nancy Pelosi's and Michael Bloomberg's support and the rest of the liberal elites will fight us every inch of the way to avoid losing one of their own in the House.

So please chip in today with $10 $25 $50 $100 or whatever else you may be able to afford.

An extensive cutting-edge digital media campaign including social media ads and more -- crucial for turning out the youth vote. 3. Dedicated field staff in every corner of Virginia's 2nd district -- from the eastern short to the Northern Neck and Hampton Roads. 4. Hard-hitting TV and radio ads all designed to ignite support from conservatives across Virginia. In a federal level effort like this every contribution is crucial to our victory. And when we win we will have accomplished so much! Not only will we have ousted Elaine Luria from her seat of power in the U.S. House we will have dealt a blow to the entire Democrat Party's agenda to seize control of Congress! So please join this fight immediately and contribute $250 $100 or whatever you can afford to DEFEAT Nancy Pelosi and Elaine Luria. If you will give me your support in this fight I pledge to do as I have for my entire career: defend our conservative values. You and I will start by defeating Elaine Luria. But this fight can only be won with your support.

Yesterday I met with Kelly Ross CEO of the Piedmont Women's Center. I had the opportunity to tour the Pro-Life facility in Greenville and speak with her regarding their positive efforts to assist women who are pregnant and considering abortion. This facility is directly across the street from an abortion clinic in Greenville. What an amazing ministry that seeks to show women there are resources to help them through pregnancy and options other than abortion for their children. Hearing Kelly's heart and passion for the women in the area was such a privilege and encouragement. My commitment to life is why I support ministries like the Piedmont Women's Center. Telling women there are alternatives to abortion but not making efforts to assist them through the birthing process and showing them the resources available does not show the care and love these women need at such a crucial time. Kelly Ross is changing that and I encourage those in the area to tour the facility and consider ways they can help this ministry. If elected I will fight to overturn Roe v. Wade. Together we can fight for life. ALL life is sacred. Let's show a hurting world that life matters above all. #prolife #lifematters #alllivesmatter #savetheunborn #antiabortion #pregnancycenter #piedmontwomenscenter #prolifegreenville #greenvillesc #chooselife,political,Facebook
As the primary approaches every woman in Barrington should know that my opponent voted to:  * eliminate buffer zones around planned parenthood and similar organizations so women could be harassed up close.  * charge those involved with abortion with murder.  * allow a womans sexual history to be allowed as evidence in rape cases.  There are very clear distinctions between my opponent and me. How we respect their rights is one such major difference.,political,Facebook
"New Year's Eve - December 31 2019 #Timberunity #TownHallTuesday  WINNING IN 2020!  What is it going to take to WIN in 2020?  In Oregon I believe the Republican Party (and especially the Constitutional Conservatives within the party) need to be on the OFFENSE.  To me that means 3 things:  1) Recall Kate Brown  2) Find every Constitutional Conservative you know and get them to REGISTER TO VOTE as Republicans. (If the Republican Party's Liberal members continue to win primaries we will LOSE at the General Election every time)   3. Here's what's written in my campaign brochure about the ELECTION:  ""ELECTION The Oregon Republican Party needs to have Conservative candidates running in every legislative district.  (60 House races and 15 Senate races.) We cannot allow the Democrats to walk back into office unopposed. They need to defend their pro-abortion anti-gun rights anti-business pro-Common Core failing public school unlawful and unconstitutional sanctuary state hesitant wildfire fighting anti-Christian policies.""  OFFENSE! Offense! OFFENSE!!!  I've watched as the Republican Party tried to use ""the fear of losing"" as a motivator to get people to vote! WRONG MESSAGE. We need a VISION FOR THE FUTURE IN 2020 that all Conservatives can get behind. The planks include:  Pro-business Fiscally Conservative Policies:  Lower Taxes Reprioritized Spending to CORE functions State government is responsible for: Public Safety Transportation and Management of the People of Oregon's Public Lands (based on maximum benefit for the County's citizens)  I believe a pro-business policy is best for the State of Oregon government. Lower taxes on business means healthier stronger more competitive businesses. It means a larger private sector work force. (Currently 1 out of 6 jobs in Oregon (17%) is Government employment. The goal should be no more than 1 in 10 (10% max.)) Over-time I think this policy would bring in the needed revenue without raising taxes or fees. A Win for Business a Win for Working Families a Win for the People of Oregon and their elected officials.  Pro-Constitution:  Holding our elected officials accountable to their OATH to uphold the Consitution not allowing an erosion of our God-given Rights. (Some of those rights are spelled out in the 1st and 2nd Amendments.)  Pro-Life Pro-family Pro-Parents Rights;  The Faith-based Family is the center of a strong society. Government interference and their attempt to redefine ""family"" is at the CORE of the Humanist Agenda. (Attempting to replace God defined time-tested institutions with Government defined ""value-void"" godless ideas of what ""a family"" is has led us to a society of confused directionless individuals who are attempting to lead us to a destination which will only cause more heartache and destruction. Not the Government Controlled Paradise they envision.) A pro-Family agenda must also include CHOICE in Education. More opportunities for parents to choose what their kids are being taught. Values are taught in school. Parents need to have a choice to make sure values taught to their children are ones they want taught.  OFFENSE! Offense! OFFENSE!!!  To get this done in 2020 we need Republicans running in every single House District (60) and in the 15 Senate Districts. The deadline to file is March 6th.  By LEAP DAY February 29th we need this done.  Goal - 60 House and 15 Senate by LEAP DAY.  I know we can do this. Oregonians future for generations to come depend on us. Let's not let them down.

Amy Barrett  Immediately If Not Sooner President Trump has the right nominee at the right moment in American history. by SCOTT MCKAY September 19 2020 2:35 AM  When Ruth Bader Ginsburg died Friday evening she did so with a message for posterity which for all the history that Ginsburg might have made as a woman on the Supreme Court was pristine in its self-description of her time on the Court. My most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed she said. The arrogance of that was par for Ginsburgs course. The fact that Republican women havent been represented on the Supreme Court since Sandra Day OConnor rankles a bit; youve got to offer big parts of your base role models when you can. Yes yes Ruth Bader Ginsburg lived an interesting life and yes yes she was an accomplished woman. Those things are beside the point. It is neither ghoulish nor inappropriate to look to the future of the United States Supreme Court upon her death rather than pay tribute to the life she lived. After all that life was for all practical purposes long since over months ago when Ginsburg chose to spend her time on deaths door occupying space on the Supreme Court in an effort to outlast President Trump. And Ginsburg practically begged us to engage in nominatorial exegesis upon her death with the unfortunate quote referenced above. That her gambit failed despite practically every responsible pundit and political voice in the country either whispering or shouting the lack of wisdom involved in Ginsburg persisting on the court long after she should have recognized her failing health and retired is not the fault or responsibility of President Trump. She was 87 years old for crying out loud. Were Trump to be re-elected did she honestly expect to linger on the Supreme Court until she was 91? Or 92? In her failing health? The vanity of Ginsburgs attempt to hold the seat for the Left regardless of the Supreme Court balance that entails did not reflect well on Ginsburg. It was an affront to American democracy not something to be given credit for. She was advised to retire years ago when Barack Obama could have appointed her replacement. She gambled on Hillary Clinton and she lost. That was Ginsburgs problem. Not Americas. Donald Trump has a Republican Senate majority and he has a candidate who has been recently vetted ready to go. There is no secret that Amy Coney Barrett currently of the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals is a favorite of the presidents to succeed Ginsburg and Barrett ought to be nominated forthwith. Truth be told Barrett would have been an appropriate if not a superior choice for either of the last two Supreme Court vacancies. Thats not a slur against Neil Gorsuch or Brett Kavanaugh both of whom were qualified and competent justices. Its just that Barrett is exactly the kind of Supreme Court Justice Trump wants and needs and with Ginsburg leaving the court on terms not quite her own but certainly terms she dictated there is no reason to wait. Why Amy Barrett? Start with the political. This appointee needs to be a woman. Yes as conservatives we hate the idea of quotas and checklists but its an election year. And since Trump didnt go with a woman to replace Anthony Kennedy or Antonin Scalia he has to go with one to replace Ginsburg. Besides the fact that Republican women havent been represented on the Supreme Court since Sandra Day OConnor rankles a bit; youve got to offer big parts of your base role models when you can. Not to mention that the Left has lived on Ginsburg as a folk hero and feminine role model for decades. Theyve made movies about her theyve turned her into an icon. Theyve almost completely ignored Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor as cultural figures something theyll now likely remedy. But Barrett is something different than Kagan and Sotomayor. Shes not only a stellar brilliant jurist shes also a regular American. No lets rephrase that. Amy Coney Barrett is no regular American. Shes extraordinary but in ways regular Americans can admire. For example and this is important she isnt another Ivy League elitist judge. While the Supreme Court is loaded down with law school graduates from Harvard and Yale Barrett is a Notre Dame graduate. Thats a big deal. The most important imbalance on the Court isnt that it has too many men or too many white people or too many conservatives  its that it has too many people who come from a very insular elitist perspective that does not reflect the experience of ordinary Americans. Amy Barrett is neither East Coast nor West Coast. She grew up outside of New Orleans attended elementary and middle school at St. Catherine of Siena Catholic School in the middle-class suburb of Metairie St. Marys Dominican High School in the city graduating in 1990 and then Rhodes College in Memphis. Barrett obtained her law degree from Notre Dame then after a pair of clerkships for distinguished jurists Lawrence Silberman and Antonin Scalia and a couple of stints at well-respected private law firms became a law professor at Notre Dame for several years before her nomination to the 7th Circuit in 2017. Barretts confirmation to the 7th Circuit was a disaster for the Left. It included the famous gaffe by Californias Dianne Feinstein in which the latter essentially attempted to disqualify Barrett for having deeply held Catholic beliefs as though that made her akin to a cult member. The dogma lives loudly within you and thats of concern when you come to big issues that people have fought for for years in this country Feinstein told Barrett during the confirmation hearings in a moment most Democrats would like to forget. What underlay that exchange was a 1998 article published in the Marquette Law Review that Barrett had written offering a very thoughtful analysis of the considerations Catholic jurists would run into regarding issues like euthanasia abortion and the death penalty. Barrett said during the confirmation hearings that were she to be a trial judge she couldnt see herself entering an order of execution but that as a clerk for Scalia at the Supreme Court she had advised the Justice on capital cases and would be bound by the Constitution rather than Catholic teaching on matters of the law. And that was the gist of the law review article  its conclusion was not that the dogma would control over the Constitution but that in cases where the two should conflict it might be reasonable for a Catholic judge to consider recusal under certain circumstances. It was an excellent performance one which put Barrett on the map as a potential Supreme Court justice and Barretts demeanor and poise in handling Feinsteins rather obnoxious assault was eye-opening in a positive way. When Sen. Dick Durbin embarrassed himself asking Barrett whether she was an orthodox Catholic and when the idiot Al Franken attempted to make her out as a homophobe because she had delivered a lecture on constitutional law at a seminar put on by the Alliance Defending Freedom on the basis of a laughable designation of ADF as a hate group by the far-left terrorist inspirers at the Southern Poverty Law Center it became quite clear that Amy Barrett is not someone the Democrats can beat down in a confirmation hearing. Presenting Amy Barrett to the Senate for Supreme Court confirmation would tee up yet another potential disaster for the Democrats just like her confirmation for the 7th Circuit was and it would do so when virtually every American is watching intently. Shes young in her late 40s. Shes a mother of seven including two adopted children from Haiti she lives a middle-class lifestyle (her husband Jesse Barrett is a prosecutor in the U.S. Attorneys office in Chicago) shes attractive shes exceptionally well-spoken and an excellent compelling speaker on the law and the Constitution. She also boasts an outstanding perspective as a mother of seven whos been a lawyer a law professor and a federal appellate judge on the question of how women might balance a career and a family. Barrett has said that women shouldnt be pigeonholed into specific roles based on other dogma on the issue; rather the individual circumstances should govern and nobody should assail their choices out of some feminist or traditionalist perspective. Thats a healthy viewpoint the majority of American women and particularly middle-class or upper-middle-class women in the suburbs will find wisdom in. Which is a trap the Democrats could easily fall into seeing as though so many of them have taken on the perspective that women who choose family over a career are somehow selling themselves short or are traitors to their sex and seeing as though the Left is insistent on forcing women to adopt more and more unrealistic ideals for themselves at an increasing cost to the happiness of women in America. Nobody would accuse Amy Barrett of that but to paint her as barefoot and pregnant because she has seven kids including two adoptees from Haiti and one with Down Syndrome will be an unmitigated disaster in front of suburban women far more likely to see her as a hero. You guys want to alienate the rest of the Catholics you havent pissed off? You want to drive away those suburban white chicks youre competitive with because of Trumps mean tweets the ones you had a brief flirtation with in the 2018 midterms but who are ignoring your texts thanks to the mostly-peaceful riots just a few miles away from where they do yoga a couple of days a week? Go make a run at (Kavanaughing) Amy Barrett. Lets see how well that works for you. Get this done now President Trump. Dont wait. Your correct nominee has already been on a Supreme Court short list. She was in the final three when Kavanaugh was selected and she was the woman of the bunch. She will be on the Supreme Court for the better part of three decades maybe longer and she will become an icon of American jurisprudence and a cultural figure who makes a joke of the Lefts narrative about the patriarchy or even white privilege  shes far more impressive and relatable than anyone on the scene griping about such Marxist tropes. And if anyone screams about the speed of the nomination or the rapidity by which it moves through the Senate those things are easily dispatched. The Supreme Court begins to hear cases in the first week of October. Having nine justices on that court is important for the country. By all rights this nomination and confirmation should have been dispensed with months if not years ago. It isnt Donald Trumps fault but Ruth Bader Ginsburgs that we come to this crossroads now with the presidential election so near. Ginsburg didnt die suddenly; shes been too ill to effectively serve on the court for months if not years. The Weekend At Ruthies memes are old and tired theyve been around so long. That kind of obstinance driven by pure partisan hackery on Ginsburgs part abetted by the Democrat party establishment possesses no rational argument for its own reward. The Republicans have the power granted to them by the American people in the 2018 elections when the GOP won enough Senate seats for a 53-47 effective majority and by former Majority Leader Harry Reid when the latter exercised the nuclear option to eliminate the filibuster on federal judges to push through a nominee. Three of those Republicans Mitt Romney Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski have expressed objection to voting for a Supreme Court confirmation prior to the election but Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Friday night there will be a vote. Even without Romney Collins and Murkowski there are 50 votes for Barrett  and thats before Doug Jones the Democrat from Alabama who is likely to get clobbered by former Auburn head football coach Tommy Tuberville in that states race is put to the question. Jones political prospects are such that a yes vote on Barrett might be the only hope he has at staving off extinction. Even without Jones vote and a worst-case scenario among faithless GOP senators its a 50-50 tie that Vice President Mike Pence who was governor of Indiana when Barrett was a law professor in that state at Notre Dame can break. In other words this nomination is there for the confirming it gives the country an excellent Supreme Court justice who will do excellent service for a protracted period of time its a transformational choice which creates a new Supreme Court for the 21st century its a political win which delivers Catholic voters and suburban women for the presidents party it creates a feminine cultural icon setting precisely the right tone and it demonstrates once and for all to conservative voters that unlike the Republican Party of the Bush era this GOP has the will and the sand to deliver on its promises. On big items. With big stakes. For lasting change. Make Amy Barrett happen Mr. President. Dont think twice dont wait. Move the nomination forward and work with Sen. McConnell to ram it through with all possible speed. You wont regret it  in fact the political capital it will give you will seal the election not just for you but for your allies down the ballot in November.,political,Facebook
"Part 2: The Real Jane Roe in Roe vs Wade  Before beginning Part 2 of this article this writer wishes to thank ALL of you who read and responded to the story of Norma L. McCorvey. The responses were nearly overwhelming but the general consensus was an appreciation for the Mayo Clinic's research and findings on the nine month gestation period in the mother's womb and the fetus developing within that environment. For the vast majority of readers these findings were a ""first time"" reading contact with such details. So it seems that the article provided educational value that gave much food for thought. And that was the purpose of this writer's research. Another definite side effect was the acknowledgement that unlike Norma McCorvey women as well as other family members and friends DO have other choices besides an abortion if all persons concerned ask questions and stay informed about those choices. According to my readers Norma seemed to be a legal ploy in all of the court proceedings. She seemed to be a victim of her own poor upbringing her own destructive decisions and of the women attorneys who were pushing for ""women's rights"" at a time in the nation when personal choices and personal conveniences were in hot discussion nationally. While Part 1 was only intended for a 3-week ""run"" on Women to Women NV it turned out to be nearly 3 months of reader comments shares and return responses from this writer. No problem. So with much gratitude to all of you let's ready ourselves for Part 2 now.  Part 2  In the Supreme Court's landmark decision in 1973 on Roe vs Wade women were given the ""right"" federally and over states' laws to abort a pregnancy. In the ensuing years between 1973 and 2019 there have been major changes in that area of thought. The U.S. Supreme Court now consists of more conservative judges who might be willing to go back and revisit that landmark decision. But that is not a guarantee for conservatives. In addition Chief Justice Roberts is a swing vote at times. Major advances in medical technology have given us much more insight into the womb and what takes place there over a period of 9 months in the growth and development of the fetus. Would that make a difference to the Supreme Court justices? In recent years the pro-choice organization Planned Parenthood has come under critical examination for tax payer monies going to support abortions. While Planned Parenthood does provide other and varied health services for women the process of abortions is the big money maker according to the Center for Controlled Diseases. This same non-profit group has been exposed for its disposal of baby/fetus body parts as in the recent film ""Unplanned"" the true story of Abby Johnson  a one- time Planned Parenthood director. In fact Abby was at one time the youngest national director ever for Planned Parenthood. Whatever one's position on this up front national debate one has to question why a young woman does not need to tell her parents that she is pregnant and seeking an abortion but is too young to see an R-rated film on abortion and its high risk factors The film ""Unplanned"" is rated R for primarily a scene that shows the baby in the womb before the abortion and then a follow-up sonogram without the fetus after the abortion procedure.. As Abby experienced in her own abortion every young woman should see the aftermath of taking the RU-486 pill that begins the abortion process. It is not a pretty sight or experience. It is accepted by the medical and counseling fields that the top areas of abortion emotional turmoil are: Grief Guilt Shame Regret and Depression. To witness these emotional traumas in real life experience must be life changing.That is also a part of this particular film which would be a very good idea for parents to view with their teenage children--especially girls. It certainly has been for two of my family members--even after nearly 40 years of going through the abortions. Fear was the motivating factor to get on that table and allow that doctor to end that life that was growing week by week in the womb. These two family members have pushed those memories way down deep into their psyches where pain still very much exists They have found no release from that pain through pills secular counseling group therapy sessions or self-help books. Perhaps they are looking in the wrong places. Ensuing medical problems have affected them to this day: high blood pressure obesity psychological/relational problems. Willingness to face the reality of what fear can cause one to do has not yet sunk in even to this day. Fear is their defense of why they chose to do what they did .Fear of telling parents at 14 15 16 etc. years of age; risking parental anger and disappointment is not something that teenage brains are mature enough to handle. Fear of having a baby at 45 or older is not something that all women socially can accept. Older women who find themselves pregnant may not feel they have the energy or stamina to raise a new child. Or perhaps more frequently females decide that one more mouth to feed is too much sacrifice financially. There are other reasons to be sure but the central reason for having abortions according to the statistics seems to be FEAR.  So where is the nation now legally with abortion?. The nation is for sure divided on the issue. In Tennessee the state House with a vote of 65-21 advanced a bill to ban nearly all abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected. The bill is now in the hands of the Senate where if passed Governor Bill Lee has agreed to support any bill that promotes fewer abortions. Hedy Weinberg executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in Tennessee has declared a lawsuit will be filed. This bill has no exceptions for pregnancies conceived by rape or incest but only for medical emergencies. In Vermont's House the most progressive abortion bill was passed by a vote of 106-36 on Feb.21 2019. The Democratic-controlled Senate is also expected to pass it with the Republican Governor Phil Scott not commenting yet. This Vermont bill is unlike the one passed by New York on January 2019 . In New York a controlled Democratic House and Senate on January 23 2019 and on the 46th anniversary of the Supreme Court decision passed a new law and a new legal protection for abortion rights. It is now part of New York state law. One provision permits late-term abortion when a mother's health is endangered as reported by The Associated Press. The previous law only permitted abortions after 24 weeks of pregnancy if a women's life was at risk. With Sarah Weddington at his side the attorney who helped argue before SCOTUS Roe vs Wade congratulating to and for the women of New York Governor Cuomo then directed state landmarks like the spire of One World Trade Center to be lit up in pink to ""shine a bright light forward for the rest of the nation to follow."" Will that be an encouragement to other states? Or not?  According to both the Guttmacher Institute and the National Right to Life Committee the former a reproductive health organization that supports abortion rights and claims non-political status and the latter a pro-life organization that does not support abortion rights 60942033 abortions have taken place since 1973. That means that 60942033 fetal voices were never heard. That means that from that 60942 033 abortions none were given the chance to be born perhaps be adopted by loving families who genuinely wanted a child never given the chance to be a unique little girl or boy man or woman. That 60 942 033 number far surpasses all those killed in American wars either domestic or abroad COMBINED. Those Americans serving in all those major conflicts represented all faiths all levels of educationand all different economic backgrounds. Those unborn babies also came from those same backgrounds with one significant difference: most abortions clinics are well- established in African-American neighborhoods. The majority of abortions are performed in black communities according to the Guttmacher Institute and the NRLC. Is there a reason/ purpose that seems to target those American communities?  When John Rogers of Alabama a Democratic state representative recently stated in his stand against Alabama's anti-abortion position ""Some kids are unwanted so you kill them now or you kill them later."" was he lashing out to the Republican- controlled house who voted 74-3 in favor of maintaining the state's anti abortion position with the warning to get ready for a fight all the way to SCOTUS? That bill is now headed to Alabama's state senate. Representative Rogers also said: ""You bring them into the world unwanted unloved you send them to the electric chair. Some children who face abortion could be retarded and half-deformed.""  Mr. Rogers and those of his supporters need to give that message to Ryan Bomberger who spoke at Wheaton College just a few weeks ago on the motto ""Black Lives Matter"". Ryan is biracial and a child of rape---a child of color .He and his wife Bethany are the co-founders of Radiance Foundation with the mission to ""creatively affirm that every human life has purpose."" Ryan says that it is not true that only some Black lives matter but rather that all Black lives matter--both in the womb and outside of the womb. When Wheaton College decided that Ryan's 50 minute presentation/talk underminded the safety of people of color on campus an e-mail was sent to every student at Wheaton. Of the 5 people involved in writing the e-mail only one of them was in attendance at the Republican student sponsored event. Franklin Graham whose parents both graduated from Wheaton College backed up Ryan's presentation by writing on his website the following: ""Ryan was critical of both Black Lives Matter and Planned Parenthood which is notorious for promoting abortions in the black community. I admire this young man who is not afraid to tell the truith. Ryan is absolutely right-- Black Lives Matter isn't living up to their name if they continue to partner with pro-abortion groups which are ending black lives statistically more than any other racial group."" If the students and faculty of color felt threatened in any way by Ryan's speech aka ""unheard underrepresented and unsafe""  then how must we view those 60942033 tiny and vulnerable voices?  Finally if there is to be a Supreme Court that over turns the 1973 Roe vs Wade decision it will not be easy or fast. Cathy Ruse a noted legal graduate from Georgetown University and a much respected former attorney and director of the Family Research Center a former litigator for the District of Columbia an author of several scholarly legal articles on constitutional issues a legal contributor to the Wall Street Journal USA Today and the Washington Times. as well as trusted expert in congressional hearings for the U.S. House and Senate notes this in no uncertain terms. In other words she is a ""heavy"" that is well respected by the legal world both internationally and nationally. Her alcolades are many. In Ruse's opinion there is one difficult obstruction to overcoming the Roe vs Wade decision...and that is the Supreme Court. She believes that with the election of Donald Trump and with his two Court appointments the chances of over turning Roe vs Wade is closer. However she states in a recent writing for the magazine Decision that for the past 40 years the Supreme Court has been peopled by justices that see themselves as the voice and conscience of contemporary society. Forcing on the nation the practice of abortion through judicial fiat fits this expansive view. In contrast there are now two new justices who see their role as following the will of the people as defined by the Constitution. The two justices who fit that description are Neil Gorsuch and Brent Kavanaugh. This brings the Court into a 5-4 situation. But is that enough? Chief Justice Roberts is seen as the ""swing"" vote. That could make him a reluctant 5th vote against overturning Roe vs Wade. As Ruse further states: ""The Court can't seem to decide whether or not the abortion right is fundamental. Some decisions say yes while others don't. What the constitutional foundation ought to be and what the legal test should be to test abortion laws has varied over time"". Roe vs Wade is the very definition of socially shifting sands. It is not the rock that its defenders portray it to be. With more than a dozen state abortion laws pending in federal courts one or more could make it to the Supreme Court for review. The key note is a willing court. Sooner or later there is a challenge coming to Roe vs Wade. Ruse seriously doubts that all states would return to outlaw abortion. But she sees some perhaps a third moving in that direction IF Roe vs Wade is overturned. States would then have the right to present to voters how they want to deal with the issue through the ballot box. And 60 942 033 might be ""listened"" to.  For Christians the issue of abortion lies with God. Genesis 1: 27 makes clear: ""So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him: male and female He created them"". Psalm 139: 13 further shares that God's hands formed every delicate and intricate part of every human being in the womb: ""For You formed my inward parts. You covered me in my mother's womb"". And Psalm 139: 16 states: "" Your eyes saw my substance being yet unformed. And in Your book they all were written the days fastened for me when as yet there were none of them."" In the New Testament Luke 1: 41 shares how John the Baptist leaps in his mother's womb as Elizabeth greets her cousin Mary who is carrying Jesus. In Exodus we are commanded not to murder ( Exodus 20: 13) a truth that even non-believers or those without scripture can perceive with their divinely crafted consciences ( Romans 2: 13-14). This is a bed rock of Christian theology. And who among us wants to defy God? The outcome of such a decision is recorded many times in ancient history and probably in our own personal history. We are accountable to the 60 942 033 aborted ones. As a nation and as individuals how are we going to handle this issue? The choice is ours as a nation and as individuals. Carol Paz at npazcar@aol.com P.S. : Even as this article is going to ""press"" Gov. Kemp of Georgia has just signed into state law the toughest abortion laws in the nation. Kemp states without fear of what this could do to his political career : ""Every life is worth fighting for...We cannot change our values of who we are for money"". A very courageous stand against Washington D.C. and the Hollywood community. The bill uses strong language based on scientific evidence and moral reasoning that the rights of the unborn dictate "" full legal recognition"".",political,Facebook
"Legislative District 1 is usually spared the negative campaign postcards.  Bad news: District 1 has just seen its first negative postcard of the campaign season and it attempts to attack me for my votes against what they call ""life.""  I would be glad to discuss my position on this issue with anyone who is interested in a two-sided discussion but briefly here's the thing:  Of course I'm not in favor of abortion at will BUT there's a big difference between that and what South Dakota's extreme laws say today. The lies and distortions used to get votes on this issue are an abuse of the democratic process. Physicians should be allowed to provide safe compassionate reproductive health care without legislative interference and women should be able to seek it regardless of where they live their income or their situation in life.  Furthermore the GOP legislators who get elected SAYING they are ""pro-life"" are usually the same legislators who refuse to vote for early childhood education who oppose a strong safety net of social services that could help prevent unplanned pregnancies who vote against improved education funding re-training and addiction treatment in our prisons and a multitude of other basic improvements in the lives of our working families.  Our democracy is too important to let simple sloganeering dictate our votes. Show the campaign puppeteers that don't live in our district that District One is smart enough not to fall for their gimmicks. Show them you can't be swayed by a single issue that they distorted into a slogan on a postcard Show them we evaluate the COMPLETE record of the legislators who represent you.

"We are currently presenting a series of lessons on the theme ""Modern Sins."" By this we mean sins which are especially prominent in modern times. One sin which is particularly prominent today is the sin of abortion. On January 22 1973 the United States Supreme Court handed down the tragic decision which removed all legal protection from America's innocent unborn children. From that time forward it has been legal for a doctor at the request of the mother to terminate a pregnancy any time during the first three months. Since that black day in American history it has been estimated that more than 25 million innocent babies have been slaughtered. The April 6 1981 issue of TIME Magazine described abortion as ""the single most commonly performed surgical procedure in America."" This Supreme Court decision allows doctors to act in a manner contrary to the oath which had long regulated at least partially their medical practice. Centuries before Christ those entering the medical profession were required to take the Hippocratic Oath which included the statement: ""Especially I will not aid a woman to procure an abortion."" As late as September 1948 when the Second General Assembly of the World Medical Association convened in Geneva Switzerland doctors were required to take this oath: ""I will maintain the utmost respect for human life from the time of conception."" However their respect for ""human life from the time of conception"" is largely a thing of the past. One wonders how society became conditioned so that it would tolerate the ruthless murder of its innocent unborn. And one wonders why the Supreme Court of 1973 handed down such a horrible decision. Basically there were two reasons or at least two alleged reasons for the Court's decision. In reality there were two lies the Court allowed itself to believe. The first lie is that which is conceived in the mother's womb is only a blob of tissue a part of the woman's body which she is allowed to dispose of at will. If the word ""baby"" can be changed to the word ""fetus"" and can be conceived of as a non-person or non-human in any meaningful sense then it's removal can be regarded not as the murder it really is but simply a surgical procedure. The second lie says that opposition to abortion is primarily a Catholic or sectarian religious position. Thus anti-abortion laws are a violation of the principle of separation of church and state. Of course abortion is not primarily a religious issue. At least it is not a religious issue unless murder itself is to be so regarded. But what about the assumption that the fetus is not human? We maintain that the following syllogism proves the humanity of the fetus: As the major premise we state that if a fetus possesses the properties which are essential to a human being then the fetus is a human being. As the minor premise we affirm that the fetus does possess the properties which are essential to being a human being. The conclusion is inescapable. The fetus is therefore a human being. It has to be human. If it is not human then it is non-human. But to say that two human beings gave life to something that is non-human is ridiculous irrational and unscientific. Hence abortion is contrary to every Bible passage which prohibits murder. In our next lesson we plan to show from the Bible that the unborn fetus in the eyes of God is regarded as a real living being and not just a blob of cells in a mass of tissue.",political,Facebook
From a young woman who chose THE GIFT OF ADOPTION...there IS another A word.  I was once put on a bus with a wad of cash for an abortion. I went to Birmingham AL.  Because abortion was legal within a reasonable length of time I was able to let my fear settle. I was able to explore options. My mother was able to find out what I was going through. I was able to come to terms with the trauma I experienced.  Because abortion was legal because I had many weeks to make my decision a loving couple has an amazing 10 year old little girl today.  What would have happened if I had been handed a wad of cash and sent to a back room for a one chance procedure? Haley wouldn't exist.  What if I had not had the time to contemplate my decision? Haley wouldn't exist.  What if I had traveled hundreds of more miles? Would I still have backed out?  What if I had been forced to act quickly rashly out of fear?  Your religion will never be my religion. But I can tell you that walking into a Catholic women's clinic full of professionals who knew the decision I was facing who never judged me or guilted me or pushed their beliefs on me who laid out my options and told me to take my time - to sit with it - to talk to people... THAT is why my daughter is here to love and be loved.  Because Christians LOVED me. Because Christians adopted my child. Payed my medical bills. Bought my food. Put a roof over my head. Showed me acceptance and understanding.  No law will prevent abortions. They've always happened and always will. It will prevent the discussions that saved both mine and my daughter's lives though. It will steal the time needed to make wise calm and educated decisions. It will isolate women in crisis. It will prevent you from reaching them. It will prevent them from reaching out to you. You who lack empathy understanding and the acceptance of people who believe differently from you.  There is another A word There is another option It is Adoption It is a gift It saves lives,political,Facebook
Dear Trump 2020 voters:  Im an American just like you. Im concerned about our country just like you.  Im a Lifelong Republican just like many of you. I have voted Republican for President most elections just like many of you.  Im a Protestant Christian believer just like many of you. I also have Catholic Jewish Mormon Muslim and non-believer family and friends. I believe we are all welcome in America.  Im opposed to abortion just like many of you. I believe in exceptions for rape incest health of the mother and inability of the fetus to survive outside the womb. I believe better than legislation good health care including free birth control is the key to reduced abortions. Free birth control is part of the current Federal Law for inclusion in all Health Insurance. Protection for Pre-Existing Conditions is also part of the current Federal Law for inclusion in all Health Insurance. I believe the current administration should stop trying to take that Federal Law away from all of us.  Im the descendant of immigrants just like many of you. I have friends that are First Generation Immigrants just like many of you have. I have family members and friends that are descendants of African Slaves just like many of you. I have family members that are part Native American just like many of you.  Im concerned about the poor reputation of our country in the world just like many of you.  Im a supporter of the U.S. military just like you. I have many veterans and active duty military in my family just like you. I support good Veterans care just like you. I respect our All-Volunteer Military just like you. I respect our Drafted Veterans that served just like you.  Im a straight married guy just like many of you. Unlike some of you I have a lesbian family member. I love her so dearly I performed her wedding ceremony to her wife a few years ago. They are like second daughters to me I love them so much. I support LGBT rights.  Im a White guy just like many of you. Like many of of you I worry about the safety of my family. I worry about the safety of my extended family. I worry about the safety of my friends families. Unlike some of you I have an African-American niece and two beautiful African-American grandnieces. I worry about their safety as they grow up. Unlike me as a White man to be safe they have to be extra careful in America wherever they go.  I support the majority of those serving as our police just like you. Because I support the police I want them to operate to protect all Americans including my African-American Niece and her African-American daughters. Because for years now African-Americans are being shot and killed at two and a half (2.5) times the rate of Whites like me my nephew and niece have to teach their African-American daughters extra safety measures. As they grow older unless we change policing they will be in danger of being shot and killed by police for being American while Black.  I support the peaceful Black Lives Matters demonstrators fighting for changes in policing.  Im on Social Security just like many of you. Im concerned about the security of the Social Security Trust Fund just like many of you.  Im very concerned about our National Debt just like many of you. In fact one of the times I didnt vote Republican I voted for Ross Perot in 1992 like many of you because I was so concerned about the National Debt. I was very concerned about the 2017 Tax Cut because it did not turn out as promised. The Individual Tax Cut was limited small Temporary and only 15% of the total. The Corporate Tax Cut was huge Permanent and more than half of it was immorally used by Large Corporations just to buy back their own stocks; not as we were promised for new investments or improved workers wages and benefits. Worse It did not pay for itself as promised. Its adding $1.5 to $2 Trillion to our already bloated National Debt.  Im concerned about medical costs just like many of you. Im on Medicare just like many of you. Im worried about Medicare funding just like many of you.  Im concerned about Covid19 just like many of you. Im an older person at higher risk just like many of you. Im concerned because I have pre-existing conditions making me more susceptible to Covid19 just like many of you. Im concerned about this Global Pandemic that has already killed 188942 Americans and 889364 people worldwide just like many of you.  As I said at the beginning I am a Lifelong Republican just like many of you. Since 1972 I have usually voted Republican for President just like many of you.  I have decided this year to Vote Democrat for President as many other Lifelong Republicans are doing.  I would ask you to consider joining me and voting for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. I believe they will lead us better than the current administration. Thank you for your consideration. Chuck Eddy Lexington KY  #RegisterToVote GoVoteKy . Com,political,Facebook
"Governor Cooper Vetoes Senate Bill 359  Yesterday Governor Roy Cooper vetoed Senate Bill 359 which was reportedly passed for the purpose of protecting infants that were born alive after an attempted abortion procedure. The only problem is we already have laws which can be used if this were to occur. We already have laws that will protect an unborn infant in its mothers womb if someone attempted to injure a pregnant woman and the infant died as a result of injuries the woman or the infant sustained. One of the things the new law would have done is to essentially deputize nurses or those assisting a doctor in an operating room by requiring them to report a doctor who did not take the necessary steps to assist an infant in distress; however there is not a single reported case in the State of North Carolina where this type of incident has ever occurred. This bill creates a false perception that doctors are engaged in improper conduct and practices which have never occurred in our state. If they were to occur then the medical licensing board as well as existing laws would address this. Please do not buy into this false narrative which is meant to intimidate doctors into not performing abortions. When this bill was debated in the Senates Judiciary Committee and its Rules Committee I raised these specific concerns. Governor Cooper in his veto message stated: ""Laws already protect newborn babies and this bill is an unnecessary interference between doctors and their patients. This needless legislation would criminalize doctors and other healthcare providers for a practice that simply does not exist."" I thank Governor Cooper for the political courage to veto this unnecessary legislation.",political,Facebook

"We have quite a few high school and college interns working on our campaign (you can sign up too at www.eladgross.org/intern).  Yesterday I was scheduled to talk to a student who had some questions about the campaign. He's Republican and was planning on interning with our current Attorney General's campaign. But he heard about me he liked what I was saying and he wanted to know where I stood on a variety of issues.  We talked for 47 minutes. I asked maybe two questions that entire time. This was his interview of me.  We didn't agree on everything. He does not support abortion. We talked a lot about privacy rights the underpinnings of personal freedom the tragic history of government intervention in medical decisions. He wanted to know my stance on guns. I talked about the training I've gone through how Missouri used to require training to carry concealed but doesn't anymore how there's a big difference between growing up respecting guns and buying a handgun when you're a teenager without any training because you fear for your life and how we can get together from across the political spectrum to take on violent crime. We talked about the economy why I want to start Missouri's first Civil Rights Division how the office works. We talked about why I like working with folks I don't always agree with.  But most importantly we talked about his community service how he'll be spending his summer helping folks in need of food how involved he is at his church.  At the end of the conversation I asked him how I did and whether he wanted to work with me.  He said ""Do you have debates with the Attorney General?"" ""I hope so."" ""I can be your practice partner.""  This is how we take back Missouri.",political,Facebook

"What if God was the first and largest possible abortionist in the history of the planet? Food for thought!  The Bible does not reveal how many people were on Earth when the flood started so we can only offer educated guesses about the pre-Flood population but we can assume that if the story is anything other than myth fairytale allegory or folklore the number could be anywhere from a few hundred thousand to billions.  According to Genesis chapter 6 every person outside the ark when the flood that was ordered and ordained by God began perished. Men women girls and boys all ages including infants and possibly millions of pregnant woman were all ruthlessly violently and mercilessly drowned by a Creator profoundly disappointed with what ""He"" created.  The word abort means to bring to a premature end because of a problem danger perceived fault or simple change of mind. Our English word derives from the Latin aboriri which translates to miscarry.  To miscarry is not only the expulsion of a fetus from the womb before it is able to survive independently often times it represents the unsuccessful outcome of something planned or hoped for.  The scriptural narrative declares that God ""repented"" (changed his mind ) and/or regretted that he made humans and insisted that His Spirit (breath) would not always ""strive"" (struggle to manage or maintain) with humanity because they were -- and still remain -- mortals meaning that we are death bound limited or terminal. Then He terminated all but 8 of all of those living on the planet.  Evangelicals who mostly claim to be biblical literalists are all up in arms about legal abortion rights and a woman's right to choose when or whether to carry a fetus full term regardless of the circumstances around how she was impregnated. These same people tacitly if not often directly support violence against same gender loving people Muslims heretics or any other persons or people groups they don't perceive to be the ""chosen"" of God or their god. Reversing Roe vs. Wade is the top priority of Christian conservatives these days and actually has been for decades.  However what many of the pro-lifers fail to notice or note is that the most pronounced single act of mass abortion ever was done by the God of the Hebrew Bible and/or of the Judeo-Christian religious pre-supposition. This ""abortion"" or mass murdering occurred in Genesis chapter 6 when God appears admittedly disappointed in humankind and the entire earth project and decides to abort it and start all over. It is interesting that both clean and unclean animals were summoned two-by-two to the ark and saved. Why could not that same God somehow cause more humans to come to the Ark ahead of the flood? Beyond those either respondent or obedient animals in the Ark all other animals on the planet also perished. What would animal rights activists feel about that happening today? And don't even bring up human rights activists and those in the Hague who persecute those guilty of crimes against humanity.  Considering the time frame from creation to the flood with the best known biblical calculations being around 1656 years and with the growth rate in the pre-flood world in anyway equal to the growth rate in 2000 (0.012) there could have been about 750 million people at the time of the Flood. However given the extremely long lifespans prior to the Flood as high as 900 yrs old the growth rate could have been much higher with some estimates having the population number somewhere between 7 and 9 billion. Either way you can be sure that millions were drowned killed and/or aborted by the angry repentant and regretful God of the bible.  What do you biblical literalists have to say about this whole scenario? Or do you not really believe the story of Noah's Ark and God ""changing his mind"" about His initial earth project?  If your God changes his or It's mind so profoundly about what and whom he created and decides to abort and/or destroy them all why would so many of the people who believe in him decide the humans he created should have the right to legally change their minds about what they created especially is unwillingly or by force? Did God decide that we humans are a big mistake worthy first of flooding judgment then later on fire? Or might we simply have misunderstood the whole thing? And should reconsider what we belief and why we believe it and how those beliefs either add to or subtract from the quality of our lives?",political,Facebook
"The state of this world is getting scary. It's unfortunate that many do not see it.  Millions are marching around the world in protest every weekend against COVID-19 lockdowns vaccine mandates and the removal of civil rights liberties and freedoms. With at least a hundred thousand protesting in cities and towns around Australia.  ""If you forget the past you are doomed to repeat it."" ""I don't agree with what you say but I'll give my life defending your right to say it.""  Two very important statements the kids of today are not being taught. Free speech is something the whole world needs. Even racist hatred and down right evil things need to be allowed to be said. Gives us the opportunity to hit back through words NOT violence.  Let's start with Covid-19:  The fear being pushed by politicians and the media about COVID-19 is out of control. No I am not one of those that think COVID-19 is a hoax. COVID-19 is real. As I read once: Do I believe that people are getting sick? Yes. Do I believe that people are dying? Yes. Do I believe some hospitals are overrun? Yes. Do I believe nurses and healthcare workers are terrified? Yes. Do I believe China is lying about it's numbers? Yes. Do I believe COVID-19 was made in a lab? Yes. Do I believe China is responsible? Yes. Do I believe COVID-19 is being politicized? Yes. Do I believe COVID-19 is being used to strip Americans and Australians of their rights? Yes. Do I believe there's a bigger picture than what politicians and the media are telling us? Yes. Do I believe this is more about power and control than anything else? Yes. Do I believe we as Australians just set a dangerous precedent for our freedoms? Yes... and I am much more terrified of that than any virus.  Am I an anti-vaxxer? No I am 100% for vaccines. Myself and my family are all vaccinated for everything except for the COVID-19 vaccine. No I do not plan to get the COVID-19 Vaccine. I will not inject a vaccine into my body that is being forced upon me. Especially a vaccine that was ready in less than a year. It takes at least 5 years to fully test a vaccine. We do NOT know the long term side effects yet. I am Anti-MANDATORY vaccine I am not Anti-Vaccine. Take the vaccine if you want I support you decision to take it. But don't force it on me.  I do not believe in lockdowns or mask mandates. We lived with Influenza (a virus that had a confirmed 0.13% death rate for the years 2016-2017) for generations without mask mandates or lockdowns. I used 2016-2017 because they are the latest years where the numbers are confirmed: COVID-19 is far more deadly for over 60's than Influenza particularly those with underlying conditions with a death rate of about 0.66%. However When you account for elderly patients dying to COVID-19 without an underlying condition that death rate drops to 0.2%. Compared to the 0.08% Death rate for under 60's with COVID-19 dropping further the younger the bracket. The Delta variant is less deadly but more contagious. Please note I am talking about the death rate (Your chance to die if you get infected) not number of deaths. These numbers are based from the CDC's own words that 90% of COVID-19 cases will go completely undetected as most of the population is asymptomatic to the COVID-19 Virus. All this information can be found on the CDC website.  Now while the death rate is higher than influenza in the older generation. This is no reason to completely shut down a country even at the high end of 0.66%. No one wants to even talk about the rising rate of ""Self harm"" especially in teenagers due to lockdowns. These lockdowns are causing far more damage than they are preventing Not just in ""self harm"" rates. Source:  Next Abortion:  Abortion is getting out of control. The latest data from Planned Parenthood states that over 98%... YES OVER 98% of the reasons given for Abortion is ""Unwanted Baby"". Less than 2% is due to Rape / Incest. 2 reasons that are the only time I ever agree with Abortion and ONLY before a heartbeat. Source:  Both men and women need to take some responsibility for your own actions. If you cannot afford / want to bring a baby into the world then Wrap it Swallow it Flush it Throw it or just say no. But please STOP using Abortion as a contraceptive. Stop killing babies because you couldn't keep your pants zipped up. I accept that accidents happen but that's the risk you take when you say yes. Deal with the consequences of your actions.  And now for the US itself:  The US is being run by a senile dementia ridden old fart controlled by special interest groups in the hopes of turning America into a communist dictatorship. The Left leaning Mainstream Media is complicit in this they regularly distort the truth to push their own agenda. Notice they are not reporting on the Phone call between President Biden and the Afghan President Ashraf Ghani. A phone call that if it happened under President Trump He would be rightfully impeached before the media could even report on it.  In this phone call President Biden's own words pressured President Ghani to distort the truth: President Biden to President Ghani: ""And theres a need whether it is true or not there is a need to project a different picture."" Source:  This is not the first time President Biden has pressured another country to help him politically: Then Vice-President Biden with President Obama's backing threatened to withhold aid money if a prosecutor that was investigating the company Hunter Biden was working at was not fired. Source from then Vice-President Biden's own lips:   There are multiple other examples of corruption lies and propaganda by the Biden administration and it's buddies in the media. However this post will become a novel if I continue. Follow me for more examples in future posts.  And finally Australia:  Australia itself is sliding down a dark path. Our country is done as we know it if the population doesn't wake up and soon.  Queensland is opening a concentration camp in the center of the state. Source:  Victoria is the next communist China puppet state. Led by a known Communist supporter. Source: Multiple other articles showing the corruption of Daniel Andrews.  The Federal Government just passed a spy bill. Allowing them to access our phones and upload or delete data at will. Source:  The media around the world doesn't even care that Australia has begun a process to strip its citizens of what little rights we had. I fear that most Australians have forgotten what happened 80 years ago. We don't even have the means to defend ourselves any more they are scared another Eureka Stockade will happen.  It is time for Australians to take a stand. It is time for us to take our country back but we need help. We need the world to care about what is currently taking place in Australia.  Australia must ditch the crown. We must become a Constitutional Federal Republic. We do not have a Bill of Rights that needs to change. We deserve our freedom. But we must earn it first.

Pro Tem Treat Bill Prohibiting Abortion Passes Out of Senate Health Committee  OKLAHOMA CITY  The Senate Health and Human Services Committee approved with an 11-4 vote a bill from President Pro Tempore Greg Treat that would prohibit abortion in Oklahoma when the U.S. Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade or if the U.S. Constitution is amended.  Treat said Oklahoma is a pro-life state and Oklahomans have repeatedly made it clear they want their elected officials to protect the life of the unborn. Senate Bill 195 would prohibit abortion in Oklahoma with the exception for the life of the mother when Roe v. Wade is overturned or when the U.S. Constitution is amended.  Treat said there are several lawsuits challenging Roe and other federal cases legalizing abortion currently in the federal court system.  Abortion has been a felony in Oklahoma since 1910 but that statute has been unenforceable since 1973 when the U.S. Supreme Court legalized abortion. Since then Oklahoma has enacted pro-life policies that have successfully saved lives and reduced abortions performed in the state.  Those regulations would be rendered unnecessary when Roe is overturned because the 1910 law then would be enforceable. By removing abortion regulations from Oklahoma statutes Senate Bill 195 would eliminate any statutory conflicts between.  Five other states have adopted laws similar to Senate Bill 195 and other states are considering similar measures.,political,Facebook

But here are some recent ones:  Russian flu 1889-1890 1 million died Spanish flu 1918-1920 50 million died Asian flu 1957-1958 1.1 million died AIDS 1981-present 35 million have died H1N1 swine flu 2009-2010 575000 died  Regarding the Covid-19 virus as of March 29 2020 there have been almost 2500 deaths in the United States and almost 34000 deaths in the world. These numbers will continue to grow in the coming weeks.  As a reminder 56 million people died worldwide in 2017. Heart disease cancer respiratory disease and infection made up 33.9 million of that total number.  I have to mention abortions here in the United States. Since 1973 we have murdered 62 million babies. In 1990 1.61 million babies were murdered and that figure was 862000 in 2018. I have a friend of many years who has always told me to be prepared for a major pandemic that will encompass the whole world. The Covid-19 pandemic has done that. I believe we will overcome this pandemic soon and then add this to the list mentioned above.  But is God talking to us as a world as a nation and individually? Is He using this present pandemic to get our attention? Yes He is! God has a plan for this earth that He put into motion over 6000 years ago. In the end our earth will experience famines plagues horrific weather patterns earthquakes volcano eruptions 1000-pound hailstones and the earth shifting on its axis. Jesus tells us in  Luke 21:11 there shall be pestilences.  Also check Matthew 24:7 and Mark 13:8. The Bible tells us that these things will happen and will be far worse than the Covid-19 pandemic that we are experiencing. I believe time is short and that within 2 to 6 decades we will see the Rapture of believers and the Second Coming of Christ. Signs are converging rapidly for this to happen. I understand and acknowledge that we cannot set any dates because only God knows the timing.  We know that Satan with his limited power is running loose on the earth today. The world is falling apart around us. God will change this soon as He defeats Satan and throws Satan into the Lake of Fire. Gods Son Jesus will rule for 1000 years in Jerusalem and then all believers will live with God for eternity in the New Heaven and New Earth.  I want you to know Jesus as your Lord and Savior. Your sins were covered when Jesus died on the Cross of Calvary. Do you sense God knocking on your door? Accept Him into your heart. When you make a sincere decision the Holy Spirit comes to live within you. You become a new person. I want you to participate in the Rapture and not be a part of the seven-year Tribulation. God is waking us up with the Covid-19 pandemic and making us reevaluate our lives.  I close with these final thoughts. A pastor friend of mine shared his thoughts with me regarding the pandemic. He believes that God is speaking to him in regard to reevaluating the different aspects of ministry to his local church. One concern he shared was reaching out to his congregation personally knowing each one of the people and helping them with their needs. May God bless his ministry as it grows.  I believe that many churches are in a sad state of affairs and may be challenged because of this pandemic. Here is a list of concerns that I have:  Apostacy Preaching the Word of God Provide evangelism Provide discipleship Do not become entertainment based Are people being saved through the ministry Teach prophecyit is over one-fourth of Bible  God has our attentiongive Him some time!,political,Facebook

My state legislator Dade Phelan is the proud co-sponsor of SB 22. This bill prohibits state and local governments from partnering with agencies that perform abortions even if they contract for services not related to the procedure. He and other hardline Republicans such as Donna Campbell have singled out entities such as Planned Parenthood in Austin. This is a clear attempt to limit local control.  During debate on the bill San Antonio Democrat state Sen. Jos Menndez attempted to add an amendment that would allow local government and abortion providers to contract on certain healthcare services like long-acting reversible contraception cervical cancer screening and protection HIV screenings and testing for sexually transmitted diseases; they shot it down.  Hundreds of thousands of women in Texas utilize healthcare services from entities such as Planned Parenthood beyond abortion. Data shows that when Planned Parenthood is removed from programs fewer Texans receive quality healthcare services. I am ashamed of the Texas legislature and elected officials that dont represent the best interests of women. Please contact your state legislators and tell them you do NOT support SB 22.,political,Facebook
"AND THEN THERE IS THE TRUTH...The media keeps saying that the new Missouri abortion law bans 'nearly all abortions' and that 8 weeks is ""before most women know they are pregnant."" Well here is an inconvenient FACT as spelled out in the Kansas Department of Health's official 2018 abortion statistics (see attached below): 69.4% of all KS abortions in 2018 were done prior to the 9th week of pregnancy. Missouri is likely similar. (FYI: A good part of the 30% of KS abortions done at a higher gestation were live dismemberment abortions.) Wouldn't a woman who was raped who believed in abortion look for signs of pregnancy by 8 weeks (two months) afterward and if still not sure just go ahead and take abortion pills? (Not saying she should of course just saying it's time the truth was told about the Missouri law.) When are members of the media going to stop parroting the talking points of the abortion industry? Here in Kansas where after we spent the last 20 years slowly but surely cutting abortions in half through informed consent laws parental consent laws laws banning tax funding of abortion banning partial-birth abortions etc. our State Supreme Court has abruptly removed our right to have any abortion laws at all. We plan to get back our right to pass pro-life laws by amending the Kansas constitution. KDHEKS.GOV www.kdheks.gov",political,Facebook
How to avoid sin? To avoid sin we must passionately love the God who does not condemn us but heals us through his sacrifice on the cross; who seeks life and hates war death abortion and destruction; who forgives without any limit and detests vengeance divorce violence and lawsuits; and who will go out of his way to love and heal those who hate him the most. To rekindle this Love for God we must look a the cross and ponder on the pain suffering and insults an infintely powerful God bore for our sins.,political,Facebook
Please respect my testimony and the story of my encounter seeing my child in Heaven. While I never held my child I still experienced her growth in my tummy and she made me a mother first. My Christian faith and beliefs are my foundation and what I weigh my stance on concerning important topics to me like abortion and being Pro-Life. Nothing can ever change my mind on the heart of God on this matter after what I experienced in my encounter. I wish everyone could feel the love He allowed me to feel from the aborted for their Earthly parents. Maybe wed fight for the unborn more. This is NOT a post to express your opinion opposite mine degrade me on my views or spew hate. If this post is meant for you to provide closure then repent take it to the cross and be grateful God loves you and forgives you. Its sad I have to even write this but any negative comments will be deleted and banned. Just dont let the devil use you like that. Practice the keep on scrolling method or unfollow method. I wont be hurt and frankly I wont care.  Happy Re-Birthday to you. Happy Re-Birthday to you.  21yrs ago you were supposed to be born. April 9 1998 was your due date. While you never got the chance to be born here you opened your eyes in Heaven in your glorified baby body. I only recall that date because Ive allowed myself to celebrate you for several years now. I wont allow myself to try and remember when you went to Heaven. That date is not worth remembering. Today we will blow out 21 candles for you while God hugs you tightly for me. He has taken care of you and loved you more than I ever could. Mommy was scared lost unsure and every selfish excuse there was to think of as a young teen. Daddy was broken hearted because he felt like he had no say. He loved you already and cried many tears. I wanted you too but I didnt have the support and felt so alone. I just didnt know what to do but do the unthinkable. I gave you to the selfish inconvenience altar and regretted it the second it happened. The cold room the sounds waking up from everything feeling my tummy now empty are all memories I dont allow myself to slip into often. I remember the day like yesterday and wanted someone to love me enough to stop me to save you. That didnt happen. Mommy lived with unforgiveness and shame for so long. I was angry at everyone who brushed you under the rug as if you never happened. I hid you from my friends and extended family because the devil told me I was a murderer and not forgivable. I believed it for longer than I should have. I thought of you often and wondered what you looked like? Whos characteristics and personality did you have? Mommy had become a Christian and still for many years after I couldnt accept what I had done. The devil beat me up over it all constantly. It took a long time for me to talk to God about you and finally ask how you were doing. I prayed for God to please let me see you so I could name you and also forgive myself. I think thats what weighed on me the most is not knowing what you were and being in Heaven nameless. God knew thats the closure I needed. He took me to Heaven in my dreams to see you. I came upon a big beautiful field of flowers and trees in all colors I had never seen before. God was all around because I could smell Him. His scent was sweet and pure. He had me hide behind a tree that had alot of long flowy branches full of flowers. Then I saw you. You were 16yrs old and my beautiful daughter just like your little sisters. You resembled both of them in so many ways. You had grown up in Heaven without me but God was letting me steal a glimpse of you. You were so beautiful chasing after flowers and butterflies in the breeze. I saw you smiling and laughing in your own little piece of Heaven. God allowed me to feel how much you loved me were proud of me and patiently waiting for all of us. I watched you for what seemed like hours but it was just a blink. You never saw me nor looked my way. I saw you very clearly and knew you were instantly mine. I just wanted to run up to you hug you kiss you and love on you but I couldnt. I had to let you remain in peace and wait for our appointed time. I also felt all the love of the millions aborted for their parents too and they were patiently waiting for their names. Once God knew I had what I needed to forgive myself He woke me up. I cried because I felt the overwhelming love of God. I could now forgive myself and give you your name. I prayed for God to give me the perfect name He wanted for you and its beautiful. He named you and mommy cherishes it close to her heart. Only a handful of loved ones will ever know your name. I asked Him to deliver your name to you so you would no longer be nameless. He told me you loved it so much. I wont be there with you my baby to celebrate another birthday. God continues to give you the best birthday every year. Know that I think of you more than you know. I dont let myself cry often but every year on this date I cry the most. Isnt it crazy that I can miss a child Ive never held or met? Ive forgiven myself and now share my encounter in Heaven with the world. You are part of my testimony and have helped many forgive themselves and name their own children waiting in Heaven. I speak out against abortion because Ive seen you with my own eyes. You were a baby with a soul who was stripped of life and went straight to Heaven and grew in age. Thats proof enough for me that God created you breathed life into you at conception and His heart broke when I was too selfish to have you. We will sing Happy Birthday eat cake for you and send you balloons like weve done for 5yrs. May God send our re-birthday song to you and you catch your balloons. We love you. Until we meet my baby girl...,political,Facebook
"LIFE | Investigators continue to uncover the abortion industry's shady practices  NCER Comments: Between 2012 and 2018 the FDA paid just under $100000 for ""fresh and never frozen"" aborted fetal tissue from Planned Parenthood to be used in research. Currently federal law still allows for the sale (without profit) of aborted fetal parts. The term ""fresh"" refers to the fact that when possible aborted fetuses are dissected while still alive to obtain their organs and tissue. This tissue was then used by the FDA to create ""humanized"" mice wherein human organs were studied as they grew in mice.  Fetal tissue use in research is strongly opposed by NCER. Human embryos and fetuses are human beings in their earliest stages of development. Every human being has a right to life and abortion constitutes the deliberate destruction of a prenatal human being. Fetal tissue research from induced abortions treats the unborn child as an object valued only for its parts.",political,Facebook
When the tyrant is in Action. We have a response There are reasons why Trump is in a hurry to nominate a new justice to the Supreme Court. One is not to repeal the abortion law. In 2016 Republicans had full control of Congress and Executive and they didnt make an effort to repeal abortion they went for the repeal of Obamacare. Two weeks after the November election the Supreme Court will start deliberating the Republicans and DOJ law suit to dismantle Obamacare affecting millions of people and their existing conditions. To Repeal Obama Care even after losing the elections is the goal of Trump. He cannot stand anything that is named Obama. The other reason for the hurry is to protect himself from all investigations on his financials tax returns and most of all to protect himself from being Court Marshall for his Negligence and lies to the country instead of providing the proper message and actions for protections as was his responsibility as President at War. His downplaying of virus dangers and lies to the country has caused over 200 thousand deaths millions of unemployed and thousands of small businesses falling. Not acceptable for a President at War. The other reason is his preparation for a coup if he loses the elections. His deceptive message about mail-in voting when Florida is not the only state who has being voting by mail in the past in high percentages and his representation that the country is full of crooks trying to commit fraud. Instead of promoting safety and civil duty he pretends to add a Trump supporter to the Supreme Court to make sure the Court will go along with his plot Our Response and actions as a country must be to vote in mail-in early voting and on election day in overwhelming numbers. That will be our coup to recover our country and our democracy!! Lets send him to retirement. His punishment will arrive one day!! Lord! Save us from Trump!,political,Facebook
A bill in Texas that would have made it possible to give a death sentence to a woman who underwent an abortion or the doctor that performed it has failed. My thoughts:  So many folks in Texas seem to spend more time figuring out how other folks should be living their lives than anywhere on the planet. What is wrong with those folks down there? Sometimes they are just bizarre.  Then I remember the late Bennett B. Patterson of the Texas Bar surely one of the greatest legal minds of the last century. In 1955 Patterson published THE FORGOTTEN NINTH AMENDMENT a small book based on his white glove hands on research of the rare first and second Annals of Congress and the Journals of the House and Senate all original documents and fully included in the appendices of his book. The Ninth Amendment and its history why we have it and what it was there to do is the Rosetta Stone of the Founders original intent that people spend so much time looking for and never finding.  Not used in a SCOTUS case of law until Griswold v Connecticut (1965) the Ninth has largely been ignored in legal education which is so heavily based on case law and stare decisis. Legal educations also tend to dwell on the arguments put forward in the majority opinion. In Griswold the Ninth was part of that opinion but the full development of its value took place in the brilliant concurring opinion of Justice Goldberg. That concurring opinion is likely the best description of our Founders original intent beyond Pattersons book. There are legal scholars who believe that the famous Texas case one also arising of the need of some Texans to tell other people how to live Roe v Wade (1973) should have been based on the Ninth Amendment not the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  If one really wants to know what the Founders intended for the powers of government for how they saw the Constitution they had produced and how they intended it to be interpreted one must know of the Ninth Amendment and the fear many had for listing any rights at all either within a rewritten and already ratified Constitution or as the original Ten Amendments. Then one reads Alexander Hamiltons Federalist Paper #84.  That done one might just come to understand that Griswold and Roe ostensibly about the dissemination of birth control information and abortion are in fact two of our most important civil rights decisions to ever come out of the Supreme Court. At no time in our lives have we needed the Ninth Amendment and the attending view of governmental powers held by our Founders than we do right now.,political,Facebook
BREAKING NEWS: In a stunning rebuke of abortion providers in Texas the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld our state's ban on live dismemberment abortions passed in 2017. While the law does not ban any abortions it does prevent the dismemberment of the unborn child if the child is alive. (To comply the physician must kill the child before dismemberment begins making the horrible process slightly less inhumane.) That law was authored by Sen. Charles Perry (R-Lubbock) and Rep. Stephanie Klick (R-Ft. Worth).  While the goal of the pro-life movement remains the complete protection of all unborn babies from abortion current Supreme Court precedent under Roe v. Wade prevents this. Our hope is that the Court will modify or reverse Roe and allow states to ban abortion when it takes up the Dobbs case later this year. If so the Human Life Protection Act recently passed by the Legislature and signed by Gov. Abbott will protect unborn babies to the fullest extent the Supreme Court allows.

1 Timothy 2:1-2 says First of all then I urge that supplications prayers intercessions and thanksgivings be made for all people 2 for kings and all who are in high positions that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life godly and dignified in every way.  Here in 1 Timothy 2:1-2 the Apostle Paul focuses on matters relating to the ChurchHis people more broadly. The first matter Paul brings up: prayer. Prayer is extremely important for this to be the very first matter brought up.  Paul encourages the Church to pray for kings and others in high authority so that they along with the Church and the others in the land might lead to peaceful quiet godly and dignified lives. Praying for our national leaders has become a lost priority for the church today especially for our national leaders. We sometimes either selectively choose to only pray for those national leaders in Government who represent our favorite political party and despise the other or we just dont pray at all because we rather debate and embrace divisiveness spit out from either political party and news outlets that feed our cravings.  However this is the opposite of what Paul instructs us to do. We MUST pray for the President Congress and Senators because prayer is an instrument God graciously will use to compel national leaders in the United States to lead peaceful quiet godly and dignified lives. And we all know this is a revival the United States deeply needs through Jesus Christ.  We must choose to pray for national leaders before gossiping about them as terrible leaders. Yes to a degree this is very true but our job in the Church is to pray our national leaders to end up having a heart change. This is hard to say and practice but it's needed. Imagine if we--the Church did this together? It's possible. It's needed.  Remember we beat to a different drum. We pray for those leaders of the Democratic party who are okay with abortion and those leaders of the Republican Party who are racist/xenophobic toward Immigrants and Migrants. Let's pray and spend time with God.  -  Founder/Director,political,Facebook

"I want to challenge the people who say they will vote for Donald Trump because he is Pro-Life. No. Hes Not.  225230 Americans have already died due to Covid19. That doesnt sound like Pro-Life. And just yesterday: ""We are not going to control the pandemic"" Meadows (Mark Meadows White House Chief Of Staff) told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" Sunday. And yet other countries are controlling Covid19.

Like many of you I am personally against abortion with exceptions for rape incest the health of the mother or the inability of the fetus to survive outside the womb. And just as a reminder there is no such thing as a VOLUNTARY late-term abortion. It Doesnt happen. There are only heart-breaking emergency medical procedures by mothers and fathers who have already decorated their nurseries. They make the very tough decision to terminate the pregnancies due to the mothers life being in danger or the inability of the fetus to survive outside the womb. It is plain and simple a tragedy absolutely not a VOLUNTARY late-term abortion as some misleading Republicans are saying.  Please join me in voting Donald Trump out of office.

Former Texas solicitor general Jonathan Mitchell who played a pivotal role in designing the legal framework of the states near-total abortion ban  Women can control their reproductive lives without access to abortion; they can do so by refraining from sexual intercourse Mitchell wrote in the brief. One can imagine a scenario in which a woman has chosen to engage in unprotected (or insufficiently protected) sexual intercourse on the assumption that an abortion will be available to her later. But when this court announces the overruling of Roe that individual can simply change their behavior in response to the courts decision if she no longer wants to take the risk of an unwanted pregnancy.

NIMROD and the 2020 ELECTION You are askingwhat does Nimrod have to do with our upcoming election? Lets take a look at Nimrodhe was the first of the mighty men to appear on earth after the Flood (Genesis 10:8-12). He established a great kingdom which included the city of Babeland oh yesthe Tower of Babel (Genesis 11:1-9). The Tower occurred in the time frame of 2242 B.C. Nimrod was the designer of an ancient power structure and the founder of a false religion. He wanted to become God so he attempted to build a tower to Heaven hoping to thwart the plans of God. Gods mighty power ended the tower construction and the people were settled in other parts of the world.  Nimrod birthed a new religion called globalism that is very active today and still spreading. Here is a partial list of Nimrods spiritual heirs: Illuminati including the Rothschilds and Rockefellers; Clinton organization; Soros; Saul Alinsky; United Nations; Pope Francis and the Global Public Authority; IMF; The World Bank; International Criminal Court; Obama shadow government; Club of Rome; Druids; Free Masons; Bohemian Grove; Yale University Skull and Bones; Satanic Club; Order of Assassins; Bilderberg Group; and the Council of Foreign Relations.  Lets talk about America. God is in control of all that happens in this world. Psalm 75:7 states It is God who judges nations. He brings one down and exalts another. God has allowed America to become a great nation founded on Judeo-Christian principles. But He has a warningHe will bless each nation with a span of time so it might prosper and do well but this blessing ends when a nation becomes degenerate rebellious and unfit to rule.  Our nation was founded in 1776we are 244 years old now! We have an experiment called a representative democracy or a constitutional republic and I believe we are close to losing that experiment.  What has happened to our country in the past sixty some years? America has become completely demoralized desensitized and deceived. For our democracy and republic to work requires the legislative leaders and citizens to be spiritually mature. Your guessdo we have that situation now? And what about the morals of our country? Morals can only be built on the basis of a true moral sourceand that is God. Not following Gods morals will lead to anarchyare we seeing that today? It appears that we have rejected objective moral values in favor of political correctness. Serious questionare we self destructing from within?  I believe we are a post Christian nation. Why? A list of Supreme Court rulings provides the answer. America has crossed over every Biblical boundary!  1962: Removal of prayer in public schools.  1963: Removal of Bible reading in public schools.  1973: Legalized abortions.  1980: Ten Commandments not allowed in public schools.  2003: Struck down sodomy law.  2013: Struck down Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA).  2015: Ruled in favor of same sex marriages.  In addition to the above what are some of the hot issues going on in our country now.  Covid-19 pandemic: A real issue but blown out of proportion and politicized. Churches are non-essential while abortion clinics are essential.  The wall illegals ICE and sanctuary cities.  A national debt of $22 trillion with $100 trillion of unfunded liabilities.  Black Lives Matter White Lives Matter Blue Lives Matter (police). Dont forget all lives matter in Gods sight.  LGBTQ issues.  Abortion euthanasia and the selling of aborted baby parts.  Global warming hoax starring Al Gore.  Epstein/Maxwell and human trafficking.  Defund/dismantle police forces.  The Squad Islam BDS of Israel.  You add to this list please.  Now let me show you how close we are to a full blown socialist state which will lead to a communist state. I mentioned Saul Alinsky abovehe wrote a book called Rules for Radicals. Hillary Clinton did her college thesis on his writings and Obama writes about him in his books. Alinsky expounds there are eight levels of control before you can create a socialist state. Check these out and tell me how we are doing.  1. Healthcare: Control healthcare and you control the people. My responsewe are almost there with a one-payer system called socialized medicine. 2. Poverty: Increase the poverty level as high as possible. Poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live. My responsewe are there now. 3. Debt: Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. My responsewe are there now. 4. Gun control: Take guns away and remove ability to defend oneself. That way you are able to create a police state. My responseenough Americans are armed now and this will not happen in the immediate future. 5. Welfare: Take control of every aspect of their lives. My responsethis is happening as we speak. 6. Education: Take control of what people read and listen to. Take control of what children learn in schools. The saying goesget the children and you have the future. My responsewe are there now. 7. Religion: Remove the belief in God from the government and schools. My responsewe are there now. 8. Class warfare: Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent and it will be easier to tax the wealthy to support the poor. My responsewe are there now.  Not a pretty picture is it!  We are on a fast track to a New World Order which includes a one world government currency and religion. The world has turned to secular humanism and that is the successor to Christianity. It began with the Humanist Manifesto in 1933 then revised in 1973. The theory of evolution replaced Gods six days of creation. Science is now worshiped as mans only hope and science denies Gods creation.  What about our churches? The Bible tells us that in the end times churches will sink into apostasy and worldliness. It is happening! Church influence is weakening or gone. Jesus is not being preached from the pulpit. Name one church today in which the pastor calls abortion a sin from the pulpit. Another pointno true born again believer can support murdering babies. If you believe in the one true God and His Bible then you have to be concerned.  All of the above to get to the 2020 election! Our country is in a big mess. The upcoming November election is the most important one in history when it comes to the future of our country. We are in a struggle for our national soul.  A quick review of the 2016 election. Trump announced his candidacy in June 2015 and then won the election with a 304-227 electoral college victory over Hillary Clinton. Against all oddsTrump showed up! My opinionTrump is not perfect by any means. He was born a sinner just like you and me. But it is obvious that God is using him in many ways as our President. I only wish that Trump be more careful and selective in his language that goes out over the internet the airwaves and print.  What has happened since? The veil of immorality greed corruption and deceit has been torn open. No President has ever faced what Trump has in his first four year term.  Here are just a few:  The Swamp including both Democrats and Republicans.  The never Trumpers (Romney Flake Ryan Bush family and others).  The Dems and mass media being one.  Deep State found in all agencies.  FBI corruption (Comey McCabe Mueller).  The Clintons and their foundation.  Attorney General & Justice Department (Lynch Holder Rosenstein.)  CIA & National Intelligence (Clapper & Brennan).  Obamas Organizing for Action (OFA) shadow government (2 miles from White House). The Organization is a democratic activist group to fight Trumps every move.  Mueller investigation.  FISA abuses.  Illegal immigration issuesthe wall.  Tax returns.  Covid-19 pandemic.  Russian probe.  Impeachment (Schumer Pelosi Nadler Schiff).  Nationalism versus globalism.  Soros threatened to take down Trump to fulfill NWO plans for financial Armageddon.  We know that if Hillary had won all the lies cover-ups and wrong doings done by Obama and Hillary would have been buried. Now they are being uncovered gradually. We are waiting on the Durham report.  The hatred of Trump can only be understood as demonically driven and thus galvanizing the division of our nation. We see that most of the Washington bureaucrats are people of depraved hearts and minds no longer knowing right from wrong.  We need Trump four more years to continue his work in saving maintaining and improving our republic and democracy.  What if Trump loses and the Democrats take the White House the Senate and keep the House. God forbid! If that happens the spiritual heirs of Nimrod win big. I predict we will have a full blown socialist government within eight years.  I do believe that God in His mercy is giving us just a little time as a country to repent. I believe that God has given us plenty of warnings and is beginning His judgment on our country. My opinion is that America will not recoverwe are too far gonewe are beyond the point of returnthere will be no national repentance.  I pray that I am wrong. Please speak up America and vote your heart in November.,political,Facebook
Real love is not to tell people what they want to hear but to tell them the truth for the benefit of their soul.  The Democrat Partys Public Housing Plans broke up nuclear families because the rules stated public housing was forfeited if the father stayed in the home.  Planned Parenthood clinics are placed in poor neighborhoods to help fulfill the founder's wishes to eradicate minority babies.  Read what Jesse Jackson prophesied in 1977 about the violence that would come to America if we legalized abortion. When I ran the Lake County Jail we had approximately 1000 inmates per day.  The two biggest common denominators were that the inmates were male and they had little to no relationship with a father.  The absence of a nuclear family is also the greatest indicator of poverty. The evil agenda of the left has hurt everyone but especially minority communities.  God is the answer. Real love comes from God and is based in truth and concern for ones eternal salvation.,political,Facebook
We are living in some of the most bizarre times in history division anarchy riots control violation of our rights fear mongering shaming shut the economy down allow abortion clinics to stay open while shutting down churches we could go on all day with these bizarre actions. So here we are one week away from our primary here in SW Missouris 7th district and my question to you is where is our current representative on all these issues? Is he engaged in discussing these issues? Has anyone heard from him or for that matter seen him? My opinion is that hes playing it safe assuming he has this primary in the bag. While stats are in his favor its arrogant to me for him to assume this. Im asking everyone that supports me and everyone that is still undecided to look at these issues and where I stand on them I make no secret of my beliefs and convictions. Im also asking each of you to help me get the word out to family friends co-workers and church members so we can finish the first part of this journey and move on to November. We cant do this without everyones effort together. I chose to run for Congress because I like many of you am tired of the status quo 9 years of Long is long enough!!!

***ACTION ALERT**** Tomorrow Thursday Feb. 13th at 10:30-1045 am House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will be introducing HJR 79 that asks to remove the original deadline date of March 22 1979. The Democrat Party in both Congressional Chambers are hoping to pass this with a simple majority vote. They claim that by doing this they do not need the Presidents signature. This violates the Constitution specifically Article 1 Section 7 that lays out the Legislative Process in order for a bill to pass. Removing that deadline would allow for the ratification of the ERA to be an added amendment to the Constitution and ensures abortion. Please call the Capitol Hill Switchboard 202-224-3121 give your zip code if you do not know your Representative and leave a message for your Representative to vote NO. If you are on Twitter follow @ERAnoshortcuts for more news on the ERA. This is a fight to keep abortion out of our United States Constitution! Also please share with your family friends and neighbors. We must not take this threat for granted!,political,Facebook
"Abortion  and the Grants Pass City Council  City Councilor Rick Riker said he met with a member of an anti-abortion group this week and may be interested in declaring Grants Pass a ""sanctuary city for the unborn""  if the idea garners enough support. Riker confirmed Tuesday that he held talks with Ryan Clark a member of the anti-abortion group RV SaltShakers about what the City Council could do.  Riker a land-use consultant and former county planner said he would ""endorse"" a sanctuary city declaration but had no plan to ""carry the banner."" ""At this time I guess the subject is on the table but there is no official movement"" Riker said. ""I think [Clark] has a focus  he has an aim he has a goal in trying to get the City Council to a 'sanctuary city.'""  Clark could not be reached for comment. Clark is the most active of several abortion opponents who have been regularly attending City Council meetings in recent months and using the public comment period to ask the council to take a stance against abortion. They sometimes use graphic language to describe abortion procedures and usually reference Planned Parenthood which has a clinic in Grants Pass.  According to published reports the sanctuary city movement that Clark espouses has gained traction in Texas North Carolina and a handful of other states. At least five cities in Texas have adopted restrictive ordinances that outlaw emergency contraception such as Plan B criminalize reproductive rights groups and fine doctors $2000 for performing the procedure. Such ordinances are enforceable criminally only if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade. The court is likely to rule in late June in a Louisiana case that abortion opponents hope may do just that to the landmark 1973 abortion-rights ruling. No other cities in Oregon have sanctuary city ordinances or resolutions in place. Abortion-rights activists were also not yet aware of such efforts taking place in Grants Pass. ""This is the first time that we have heard about it in Oregon"" said Andra Carrick interim executive director for NARAL Pro-Choice Oregon in Portland.  Many of the Grants Pass abortion opponents have continued to attend local City Council meetings with the same message but the city's response has been to defer to federal and state laws which allow abortions. Mayor Roy Lindsay last week announced plans to move public comments to the end of meetings as a way to address concerns by councilors that abortion opponents were bogging down council meetings and effectively cutting in line ahead of people who had business on the agenda. During a workshop Monday Lindsay attempted to walk back his stance saying abortion opponents were not the sole cause for moving the public comment period that he never mentioned the RV SaltShakers by name and that the ""news media"" may have gotten the wrong idea.  Regardless several of Riker's colleagues on the City Council said Tuesday they were not enthusiastic about a sanctuary city declaration. Councilor DJ Faszer called the subject ""contentious."" ""I don't consider that in my jurisdiction"" he said adding ""I don't think I could get behind something like that."" Councilors Barry Eames and Dennis Roler shared similar thoughts. ""I wouldn't go along with that at all"" Eames said. ""That's not what city government is about."" ""I just don't think it would go very far"" Roler said. ""There's a lot of our citizens who think the other direction despite beliefs."" Councilor Clint Scherf said he was not aware of any such discussions taking place and that he also did not believe it was the city's business to mull over. ""I don't think I would be on board for that"" Scherf said. Councilors Joel King and Valerie Lovelace did not return calls for comment.  Council President Tyler Flaming said he is related to Clark and that he also is against abortion but mostly as a person not as a councilor. Flaming added that he did not necessarily agree with the RV SaltShakers or their methods  he said that he understood the legality and the need for abortion in cases related to rape incest or other needs outside of ""birth control."" ""I get what they're saying"" Flaming said of abortion opponents. ""It's just not quite cut and dry for me."" Flaming said his focus was on other city needs which include an $81 million water treatment plant project selling the River Road Reserve and the much-anticipated development of the Dollar Mountain property. ""Those are the things I really want to focus on"" Flaming said.  As for anti-abortion proclamations Riker did not dismiss an alternative method such as an advisory question to seek support on the issue. ""We the City Council are sworn in and need to obey the laws of the land"" Riker said. ""So where it goes from here I don't know"" he added.",political,Facebook
I want to say thank you to the Republican legislatures of Alabama Georgia Ohio Missouri Mississippi Arkansas Kentucky and Utah who have told women that we are too delicate not intelligent enough and simply not enough to make intelligent medical choices about our own bodies. They have decided for us that they know better than we do placing their religious beliefs above the Constitution (which separates Church and State in the First Amendment).  They have decided that a zygote the size of pinpoint has more rights than I do as a living breathing tax-paying human being. A fetus has more rights than I do. A blastocyst has more rights than I do. That if I have an abortion I will spend more time in jail than a rapist will an abuser will a murderer will (unless of course it is a woman who has killed her abuser... then all bets are off...)  I want to thank them for having defined what they think of women. We are nothing more to them than blow up dolls and incubators.  It is time to show them our power. It is time to stand up and fight. It is no longer time to just write letters and call it is time to show up put your bodies on the line... sit ins protests marches. Non-violence is the key. Always remain non-violent.

"Remember! 6th Excerpt  Remember when Trump did ""this that and the other""? Who can possibly recall all of this American disaster? Fortunately ""McSweeney's Internet Tendency"" has been recording them all along the path!  Following is their collection from a single month May 2019 within the Trump Administration.  For the full 940 entries to date search ""McSweeney's Lest We Forget"" and select the October 19 2020 collection. (Providing the link here would prevent this preface from being shared on your Facebook page.)  To avoid any biased ""selection"" Disinfect America 2020 has not read this excerpt nor any of it extensively.  But If you agree that it is important to share to make Americans aware we trust that you will. DA 2020  MAY 2019  600.  May 7 2019  The White House blocked former White House Counsel Don McGahn from disclosing records to the House Judiciary Committee. The documents contain information about Trump urging McGahn to fire Mueller. They also reference subsequent conversations in which the president told his former counsel to deny the exchanges.  601.  May 9 2019  At a rally in Florida Trump said How do you stop these people? when referring to migrants at the border. An audience member yelled Shoot them! The president then smirked and joked Only in the Panhandle!  602.  May 13 2019  Trump hosted Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbn at the White House. Orbns actions include installing a barbed-wire fence along the border to prevent impoverished migrants from the Middle East and Africa from entering the country. Trump said of the reactionary politician Viktor Orbn has done a tremendous job in so many different ways.  Probably like me a little bit controversial but thats OK.  And I know hes a tough man but hes a respected man. And hes done the right thing according to many people on immigration.  603.  May 15 2019  The Federal Register published safety rule changes that loosened an Obama-era restriction on offshore drilling. The safety regulation was enacted after the deadly 2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion in the Gulf of Mexico. The changes meant a savings of hundreds of millions of dollars for oil companies which donated large amounts of money to Trumps re-election campaign.  604.  May 20 2019  At a rally in Pennsylvania Trump repeated a claim that the United States has no more room for immigrants. Our country is full. We dont want people coming up here he said. His words contradicted what he said a month earlier: We have companies pouring in he said. The problem is we need workers.  605.  May 21 2019  The Department of Health and Human Services finalized a rule that allowed health workers to opt out of providing medical care if the procedure violates their conscience. Examples cites include abortion gender confirmation surgery and assisted suicide.  606.  May 24 2019  The Trump administration informed Congress that it would go ahead with $8 billion worth of arms sales to Saudi Arabia Jordan and the United Arab Emirates  despite congressional objections that it would lead to Saudis dropping bombs on civilians in Yemen.  607.  May 29 2019  Special Counsel Robert Mueller finished his report and then resigned from his investigative position transferring the responsibility of holding Trump accountable to Congress. If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime we would have said so Mueller said. We did not however make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime.  608.  May 30 2019  Trump threatened to impose a five percent tariff on all goods coming into the United States from Mexico  until such time as illegal migrants coming through Mexico and into our Country STOP.  609.  May 30 2019  The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services sent an email to federal migrant shelters notifying them that the government would not pay for educational and recreational programs for unaccompanied minors including English classes and legal aid.

"Today Democrats blocked a vote in the Senate on two pro-life bills: S. 311 which would require doctors to provide medical care to a child who survives an abortion and S.3275 which would ban abortions beginning at 20 weeks.  The Democratic Partys pro-abortion extremism knows no bounds. Senate Democrats today prevented a vote on these commonsense bills as House Democrats have already done 80 times. It is beyond belief an entire party would so fiercely object to basic protections for babies. I call on Democrats as Senate Majority Leader McConnell said today to take a ""clear and moral stand"" to protect innocent life.  The CDC documented 143 instances of infants surviving abortion between 2003 and 2014. However only eight states require the reporting of infants who survive abortions. Additionally this information is provided by unsupervised abortion providers. Furthermore the CDC reports that 1.2% of abortions occur after 20 weeks gestation which is near the gestational age where many babies can survive outside of the mothers womb.",political,Facebook
"The Georgia General Assembly reconvened this morning for the first time in nine months. Tens of thousands of Georgia children have been slaughtered in the interlude. The Republican legislators are touting last year's ""Heartbeat Bill"" as a major achievement in the fight against abortion and saying that they will not focus on the issue this session while they wait to see if the federal courts will allow them to enforce it all the while knowing that there is zero chance that the courts will permit that. They are nervous about winning control of the House of Representatives in this fall's election and think that if a strict anti-abortion law is even discussed let alone passed it could hurt their chances in November. Unfortunately many Christians will agree with these reasons ""wanting to play the long game"" or ""taking what they can get"" and thus won't hold them accountable. But if babies are actually being legally murdered shouldn't ending that be a top priority in every legislative session until it is accomplished? They haven't banned abortion in this Assembly so what is the point of giving the GOP another majority? Will they have more guts next year? The time for justice is always now. We cannot wait for a more ""opportune"" time. This is the Law of Christ that we are concerned with. His honor is at stake. To permit innocent people to be killed is to mock our Creator.

I normally would not weigh in on such a sensitive topic But We continue to hear so much debate about abortion but let's be clear. Abortion is killing unborn children. In most cases living children. Saying it is anything else is just a way to dehumanize the embryo to relieve some of the guilt and make it more palatable. Did Alabama get it right no. But abortions due kill unborn babies. If you want one fine but don't sugar coat it or try to justify it by saying it not a child.,political,Facebook
Per the Democrats love infanticide narrative being peddled by pro-birthers -  Democrats argue that current law already protects infants and that Republicans are creating a false narrative about doctors routinely allowing healthy full-term babies to die when in fact abortions late in pregnancy are rare and most involve severe fetal anomalies or risks to the life of the mother. Republicans are misrepresenting why when and how frequently abortions take place late in pregnancy. If a doctor does harm to a baby who was born alive as in the notorious case of Philadelphia physician Kermit Gosnell prosecutors bring murder charges under existing law.  I dont personally believe that a newborn should be denied medical care if it survives an attempted abortion nor am I aware of many if any that actually take place. In 2002 Congress passed the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act which guaranteed to infants born at any stage of development full legal rights. There are already laws on the books. Women do not request abortion when they are in labor and doctors do not provide it. This is nothing more than political grandstanding in an effort to rally back Christians that have veered from supporting Trump over his style of leadership caustic nature and overall behavior while in office.,political,Facebook

Column2019-02-04  Let It Burn! Those were the words of Senator Mamie Locke (D-Hampton). She is Chairman of the Senate Democrat Caucus. Why would she say such a thing? What prompted this speech on the floor of the Senate? We do not know what she meant but her speech was the response to the Republican proposal to return almost $1 billion dollars to the taxpayers of Virginia. In the Governors budget he proposed spending all of the money generated by the federal level Trump tax changes. Those changes included a big increase in exemptions while eliminating others. This gave state government a chance to absorb a big chunk of the taxpayers federal tax cut. Our proposal would return those dollars to those hard-working families that paid them! The Democrats voting as a block voted to stop our effort to act immediately. To take any action immediately requires a super majority vote. That is what I think Senator Locke meant by her let it burn speech. However that vote simply means that taxpayers will be delayed in their filing or that our proposed tax return will be delayed. How will our tax return plan work? Later this year individuals would receive a $110 tax rebate and couples would get a tax rebate for $220. Beginning next year the standard deduction for personal income taxes will increase by 50%. An increase in the standard deduction lowers your taxable income and as a result you pay less in taxes. If enacted our plan would constitute the second largest tax cut in Virginia history. The plan returns all $976 million of the projected revenue windfall created by the federal tax reform and simplification to taxpayers in direct tax relief. The increase in the standard deduction is long overdue. While the standard deduction allowed when you pay your federal income taxes has regularly increased Virginias has not. As a result Virginians filing their personal income taxes as individuals today are allowed the same $3000 standard deduction that was allowed 30 years ago. Under our plan that deduction would jump to $4500. Couples would see their current $6000 standard deduction jump to $9000. By giving this money back to taxpayers Senate Republicans are insisting that state government live within its means. Restraining the growth of government spending is always a challenge. It is essential to maintain our AAA bond rating and to ensure the sustainability of the essential government services you expect. With this we still have a budget that is balanced and well still have your tax dollars prioritized providing core government services. Like the federal tax plan which also substantially increases the standard deduction the goal is to not only lower your income taxes but to make them simpler and more sensible. As a result the bulk of the tax relief goes to working families. Ours is a tax relief plan for the many not the few. Late Term Abortion Sadly the issue of late term abortion came up in the House of Delegates last week. Delegate Tran (D-Fairfax) offered legislation that according to her own description would make it legal in Virginia (just as has been signed in New York State) to kill a baby up to the final point of delivery! It is sad that anyone would consider such a barbaric action. Some may not believe as I do that life begins at conception. However even the most ardent who believe in abortion find it unacceptable in the last months. Sadly the Governor agreed with Delegate Tran. Everyone must remember that elections have results.

Pardon my absence. Life has been happening. I wrote the following though the list is incomplete:  Leftists in their worldview decide what they want to be true act as if its true and demand that you act as if its true as well. Understand that leftists are religious fanatics and label all of those who oppose the leftist faith as racists white supremacists misogynists etc. They will then do all that they can to destroy the lives and families of those who do not follow the faith.  Here are some prime examples of untrue things that the left holds as self-evident truths.  A biological male becomes female when he says hes female Biological men have no advantage over women in sports The number of genders cannot be counted Nearly everything in life can be free The government can provide for all of societys needs All whites are racist no other race is racist Blacks who disagree with the faith are white supremacists Math is racist The English Language is racist. Spelling and grammar are racist Forcing children of color to learn the above is racist Everyone is an oppressor or oppressed. There are no people just trying to live life. You can raise the taxes on the rich and they wont leave Raising taxes on businesses will create jobs Building a business is greed Taking other peoples stuff isnt greed Abortion is a matter of my body my choice Vaccines arent a matter of my body my choice Voter IDs are racist Covid passports arent racist Small children should learn about the intricacies of sex including things like anal sex 18-year-olds shouldnt own guns 16-year-olds should be able to vote 14-year-olds should be able to get abortions without parental knowledge 3-year-olds should decide what gender they are If you take guns from law-abiding citizens criminals will stop shooting people Not arresting people for committing crimes will lower crime rates The protests that caused many deaths and billions in destruction were peaceful November 6 in DC was an attempted insurrection by violent extremists (though none had weapons) The biggest problem in the US military is white supremacy Organized Christianity is evil Orthodox Judaism is evil Islam is good and peaceful Israel is an oppressor.

I also understand that some think the Constitution is evolving with changes in society and the times however I think that we all agree that the most fundamental principle protecting the people should never be lost or changed. The Supreme Court must always be the guardian among other things of the notion that America is a country of the people by the people for the people. Any one or anything that attemps to alter this must be destroyed without any reservation or doubt and at any cost Other issues that are always raised to divide Americans are gay rights and abortion rights.Lets settle these once and for all. Gays should have all the rights of the rest of the population including marriage and its benefits. No less rights than any other group in society.  On the subject of abortion another divisive issue used by both sides. Abortions are not healthy nor safe in many instances and are extremely emotionally and physically draining. In some medical circles they say that it could impair future pregnancies. They should be few and rare however the woman should be the ultimate judge perhaps sometimes with family and or partner and there should be lawful safe controlled centers or clinics to conduct them.

There are at least two reasons why Trump is in a hurry to nominate a new justice to the Supreme Court One is not to repeal the abortion law. In 2016 Republicans had full control of Congress and Executive and they didnt make an effort to repeal abortion they went for the repeal of Obamacare. Two weeks after the November election the Supreme Court will start deliberating the Republicans and DOJ law suit to dismantle Obamacare affecting millions of people and their existing conditions. To Repeal Obama Care even after losing the elections is the goal of Trump. He cannot stand anything that is named Obama. The other reason for the hurry is to protect himself from all investigations on his financials  tax returns and most of all to protect himself from been Court Marshall for his Negligence and lies to the country instead of providing the proper message and actions for protections as was his responsibility as President at War. To have a Supreme Court with extensive Majority will save him from been prosecuted and judged for causing thousands of Americans to die  to lose their jobs and small businesses. And the damage of his deceptions and lack of actions has not ended. But on November 3rd. Lets send him to retirement. His punishment will arrive one day!! Lord!

"he Real Jane Roe in Roe v. Wade  She was just 22 years old at the time--a young woman who found herself pregnant in a state where abortion was illegal unless the mother's life was endangered. That state was Texas. The year was 1970 and her real name was Norma L. McCorvey. Norma Leah was born in the back swamps of Louisiana but her parents moved the family to Dallas before they divorced when Norma was just 13 years old. There is evidence that Norma was abused by her father and that the home life was very unsettled and tense. Norma's mother was also a violent alcoholic who also could have been abusive to her daughter. Norma was sent to a reform school to try and get her back on track with a new attitude toward her studies but it did not work. Norma who was pregnant dropped out of high school at sixteen ran away with her boyfriend got married to him ( Elwood McCorvey ) and moved with him to California. The marriage failed quickly with Norma turning up on her mother's doorstep soon after with a small infant. Knowing that her daughter had no idea of what parenting meant Norma's mother took the child herself to raise the little girl. Eventually Norma went to live on the streets where she found herself homeless a high school drop-out addicted to alcohol and drugs financially destitute or temporarily living with some soul who took her in for care and protection. Again she was pregnant However this time the father wanted his baby. The condition he put to Norma was that she would never see the baby or become involved in the raising of the child. Norma accepted the ultimatum. When Norma becomes pregnant for the third and final time it would change her life forever. It would also change the life of a nation in legal and societal ways up to the present time--2019. So Norma had two children who were not aborted but what would she do about the third pregnancy? She might have left Texas for another state which did allow for abortions. She might have put the baby up for adoption. Or she might have tried to get around the law. Norma swore up and down to all who would listen that she had been raped. She insisted that she was the innocent victim of a sexual assault. However there had been no police report to verify that assertion. There was no corroborating evidence to help the police or Norma. Fortunately or unfortunately Norma was directed by adoption officials to seek out the help of two particular attorneys--Linda Coffee and Sarah Weddington.  These two active female attorneys would eventually enter the ensuing court papers and the legal confrontations which would eventually please the feminist movement that was growing quickly in the U.S. and much of Europe. The two attorneys took up the case in 1970 with the plaintiff being ""Jane Roe"" in Roe v. Wade. In 1970 a suit was filed in Dallas in a three-judge federal court on behalf of a pregnant woman known as Jane Roe and all other women ""who were or might become pregnant and want to consider all options."" The suit was against Henry Wade the district attorney at Dallas an official responsible for enforcing criminal laws including abortion statutes. The suit asked that Texas law be declared unconstitutional and that an injunction be issued telling Wade to stop prosecuting doctors who performed abortions. It was during these court proceedings that Norma gave birth to a healthy baby girl who was put up for adoption immediately. She was not yet free to consider an abortion in Texas. The case would make its way up to the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS ).  On January 22 1973 SCOTUS issued its very famous and controversial 7 to 2 decision. The majority stated that most laws against abortion violate a constitutional right to privacy thus overturning all state laws outlawing or restricting abortion. The decision was based on the 9th and 14th amendments. This was a landmark ruling which essentially divided the nation into 2 camps: Pro-choice and Pro-life. Opposition to Roe came primarily from those who viewed and still do that the Court had overstepped or strayed too far from the text and history of the Constitution. There was also opposition from those who believed in the personhood of fetal human life while in the womb. Supporters came from those who viewed and still do that a women has the right to privacy equality and personal freedom. Another two groups from law enforcement and health services wanted to save women from unclean and unethical conditions irreputable sources and from the distinct possibility of death during an illegal or botched abortion.  Coffee and Weddington were elated with the decision. It had never been a question in their minds about whether Norma L. McCorvey had been raped but rather about the legal fight and legal results that would help all women be able to seek an abortion regardless of rape. Was Norma elated as well? Did this long very personal and public debate leave her feeling vindicated satisfied ready to go on to the next chapter of her life? Did she publicly express gratitude for her attorneys' efforts and victory? No. While it is true that her real identity was kept secret from the public for a decade in the 80's Norma herself revealed the ""Roe"" identity and all ""hell"" broke loose in Texas surrounding her private life. Her public and personal appearances brought extreme reactions within her daily life. While trying to buy groceries at local businesses other shoppers began shouting matches against her gun shots were taken at her home day or night as well as personal assaults directed towards her verbally and physically. Harassment was common for Norma in Texas during this aftermath. Norma was also feeling as if she had been ""used"" by feminist groups; they still seemed to be looking down on her as a symbol of how not to be--poorly educated especially by elitist females all over the country. At one point Norma sought refuge in a lesbian relationship for two years before dissolving the relationship.  Norma brought on another form of great stress when she proclaimed herself to be a pro-life activist as well as a born again Christian. She would seek Christian counseling over a period of time and would become an active member of the Catholic Church in Dallas. She was invited for television interviews and other public appearances such as parades and speaking opportunities. Being thrown into the limelight with her identity unmasked was a challenge indeed. With the help of ghostwriters Norma had two books published on her life of the streets of the Roe v. Wade ordeal and of her public notoriety: I Am Roe: My Life Roe v. Wade and Freedom of Choice and Won by Love: Norma L. McCorvey Jane Roe of Roe v. Wade Speaks out for the Unborn as She Shares Her New Conviction for Life. Unfortunately neither publication was a victory for pro-lifer or for pro-choice. Norma continued to maintain until her death that the first trimester of pregnancy was fine for an abortion. Norma L. McCorvey died in 2017 within an assisted facility of heart complications. Perhaps if she had known about the new medical technology for observing the fetus in the womb during all three trimesters her awareness of life in uterine environment would have made her emotionally more mature--realizing that the most recent facts were very important in making life changing decisions. Before death Norma made a rather insightful version of the problem: ""More and more I'm the issue.I don't know if I should be the issue. Abortion is the issue. I never even had an abortion.""  Part 2 of this presentation will appear on Women to Women in about 3 weeks. This second part will focus on where the country is today in light of the Roe v. Wade decision--especially as Governor Andrew Cuomo signed into law on the anniversary January 22 2019 an extreme abortion law. Will it too affect the other states to become a national/federal and eventual SCOTUS decision? In the meantime here below are current facts. Carol Paz at npazcar@aol.com.

"The state of this world is getting scary. It's unfortunate that many do not see it.  Millions are marching around the world in protest every weekend against ""The Sniffles"" lockdowns poke mandates and the removal of civil rights liberties and freedoms. With at least a hundred thousand protesting in cities and towns around Australia. ""If you forget the past you are doomed to repeat it."" ""I don't agree with what you say but I'll give my life defending your right to say it."" Two very important statements the kids of today are not being taught. Free speech is something the whole world needs. Even racist hatred and down right evil things need to be allowed to be said. Gives us the opportunity to hit back through words NOT violence.  Let's start with ""The Sniffles"":  The fear being pushed by politicians and the media about ""The Sniffles"" is out of control. No I am not one of those that think ""The Sniffles"" is a hoax. ""The Sniffles"" is real. As I read once: Do I believe that people are getting sick? Yes. Do I believe that people are dying? Yes. Do I believe some hospitals are overrun? Yes. Do I believe nurses and healthcare workers are terrified? Yes. Do I believe China is lying about it's numbers? Yes. Do I believe ""The Sniffles"" was made in a lab? Yes. Do I believe China is responsible? Yes. Do I believe ""The Sniffles"" is being politicized? Yes. Do I believe ""The Sniffles"" is being used to strip Americans and Australians of their rights? Yes. Do I believe there's a bigger picture than what politicians and the media are telling us? Yes. Do I believe this is more about power and control than anything else? Yes. Do I believe we as Australians just set a dangerous precedent for our freedoms? Yes... and I am much more terrified of that than any virus.  Am I an anti-poke? No I am 100% for pokes. Myself and my family are all poked for everything except for the ""The Sniffles"" poke. No I do not plan to get the ""The Sniffles"" poke. I will not inject a poke into my body that is being forced upon me. Especially a poke that was ready in less than a year. It takes at least 5 years to fully test a poke. We do NOT know the long term side effects yet. I am Anti-MANDATORY poke I am not Anti-poke. Take the poke if you want I support your decision to take it. But don't force it on me.  I do not believe in lockdowns or mask mandates. We lived with Influenza (a virus that had a confirmed 0.13% death rate for the years 2016-2017) for generations without mask mandates or lockdowns. I used 2016-2017 because they are the latest years where the numbers are confirmed. [1] ""The Sniffles"" is far more deadly for over 60's than Influenza particularly those with underlying conditions with a death rate of about 0.66%. However When you account for elderly patients dying to ""The Sniffles"" without an underlying condition that death rate drops to 0.2%. Compared to the 0.08% Death rate for under 60's with ""The Sniffles"" dropping further the younger the bracket. ""The Delta Sniffles"" is less deadly but more contagious. Please note I am talking about the death rate (Your chance to die if you get infected) not number of deaths. These numbers are based from the CDC's own words that 90% of ""The Sniffles"" cases will go completely undetected as most of the population is asymptomatic to the ""The Sniffles"" Virus. All this information can be found on the CDC website.  Now while the death rate is higher than influenza in the older generation. This is no reason to completely shut down a country even at the high end of 0.66%. No one wants to even talk about the rising rate of ""Self harm"" especially in teenagers due to lockdowns. These lockdowns are causing far more damage than they are preventing Not just in ""self harm"" rates. [2]  Next Abortion:  Abortion is getting out of control. The latest data from Planned Parenthood states that over 98%... YES OVER 98% of the reasons given for Abortion is ""Unwanted Baby"". Less than 2% is due to Rape / Incest. 2 reasons that are the only time I ever agree with Abortion and ONLY before a heartbeat. [3] Both men and women need to take some responsibility for your own actions. If you cannot afford / want to bring a baby into the world then Wrap it Swallow it Flush it Throw it or just say no. But please STOP using Abortion as a contraceptive. Stop killing babies because you couldn't keep your pants zipped up. I accept that accidents happen but that's the risk you take when you say yes. Deal with the consequences of your actions.  And now for the US itself:  The US is being run by a senile dementia ridden old fart controlled by special interest groups in the hopes of turning America into a communist dictatorship. The Left leaning Mainstream Media is complicit in this they regularly distort the truth to push their own agenda. Notice they are not reporting on the Phone call between ""Dementia man"" and the Afghan Leader ""AG"". A phone call that if it happened under ""T man"" He would be rightfully impeached before the media could even report on it.  In this phone call ""Dementia man's"" own words pressured ""AG"" to distort the truth: ""Dementia man"" to ""AG man: ""And theres a need whether it is true or not there is a need to project a different picture."" [4]  This is not the first time ""Dementia man"" has pressured another country to help him politically: Then Vice-""Dementia man"" with ""O man's"" backing threatened to withhold aid money if a prosecutor that was investigating the company ""Dementia man's son"" was working at was not fired. From then Vice-""Dementia man's"" own lips: [5]  There are multiple other examples of corruption lies and propaganda by the ""Dementia man"" administration and it's buddies in the media. However this post will become a novel if I continue. Follow me for more examples in future posts.  And finally Australia:  Australia itself is sliding down a dark path. Our country is done as we know it if the population doesn't wake up and soon.  Queensland is opening a concentration camp in the center of the state. [6]  Victoria is the next communist China puppet state. Led by a known Communist supporter. [7]  Multiple other articles showing the corruption of Daniel Andrews. The Federal Government just passed a spy bill. Allowing them to access our phones and upload or delete data at will. [8]  The media around the world doesn't even care that Australia has begun a process to strip its citizens of what little rights we had. I fear that most Australians have forgotten what happened 80 years ago. We don't even have the means to defend ourselves any more they are scared another Eureka Stockade will happen.  It is time for Australians to take a stand. It is time for us to take our country back but we need help. We need the world to care about what is currently taking place in Australia.  Australia must ditch the crown. We must become a Constitutional Federal Republic. We do not have a Bill of Rights that needs to change. We deserve our freedom. But we must earn it first.

"For several lessons we have been studying on the general theme entitled ""Modern Sins."" By this term we have referred to sins which are as old as man but which have become prominent and popular in our society. As we conclude this series we shall discuss a sin which I find difficult to identify with any one word. Perhaps the most correct one word description of this sin is dishonesty. Of course all Bible students are surely aware that lying in any form is sinful. According to Revelation 21:8 ""all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone..."" In Colossians 3:9 Paul said to the saints at Colosse ""Do not lie to one another since you have put off the old man with his deeds."" Many are the passages which enjoin honesty and which forbid any form of dishonesty deception or lying. But in this study we are not referring to the dishonesty and deception which characterize deliberate outright lying. As stated all Bible students know this to be wrong. Primarily we are referring to the dishonesty so often reflected in both speech and writing which is calculated to remove the social stigma that ought to be inherent in any moral sin. Let me be more specific. The word ""homosexual"" is gradually being changed in speech and print to the word ""gay"" - a term which formerly denoted something good pleasant and cheerful. As the word changes there is also an accompanying change in many people's revulsion for this sin. Whereas certain people formerly were said to engage in ""promiscuous sex"" those same people are now said to be ""sexually active"" - the latter term unlike the former being a term which does not necessarily denote that which is inherently evil - at least not with regard to husbands and wives with each other. The Bible in both the Old and the New Testaments specifically condemns adultery. But now people speak of ""having an affair"" with someone. The word ""affair"" doesn't sound nearly so bad. There was a time when some companies published material which was correctly labeled as being ""pornographic smut"" but now it is called ""sexually explicit material."" We used to hear people refer to certain utterances as being ""obscene"" but now it is simply termed ""adult language."" Formerly those who tried to justify abortion were regarded as justifiers of murder but now they are regarded as ""pro choice"" - a term which to many denotes a person who is progressive and enlightened. Of course there has not been a toning down of labels in every situation. For example those who oppose pornography are not praised for their moral uprightness; to the contrary they are ridiculed as ""fundamentalist self-appointed censors."" Those who oppose abortion are not complimented for being anti-murder; to the contrary they are stigmatized for being ""regressive"" and ""bigoted."" In so many segments of our society there seems to be a studied attempt to manufacture or coin new terms and phrases lest people make the mistake of telling it like it is so that all might be able to recognize the sinfulness of sin. When the ""poison"" label is removed from poison somebody is likely to get hurt. And when the ""sin"" label is removed from sin a lot more will get hurt. Whether we are describing that which is either good or bad let us be honest for every form of lying is sinful and damnable.",political,Facebook

And the Ohio State legislature thinks this can not be done for ten years plus. In the mean time the liberal baby murders don't think it should take anytime to murders even more people. Folks I need help to move this forward. If you can and will help send a message to me either from here or send an email to me at Patrick@PatrickJQuinn.net I want to be able to go around and talk to more people about this as well as organize a campaign to get this put on the ballot to be a Constitutional Amendment. There should be no greater priority in America than to save to save the lives of our future.  Human Rights for All Act. As proposed by Patrick J. Quinn and team.  The proposed outline for the law does not add expensive new bureaucracy and it simply uses existing law the laws and constitutions in all 50 states and the Constitution of the United States of America. It also accomplishes this without going through all the long and expensive legal ramblings of overturning Roe vs. Wade. The following is the premise of the law: Under the due process clause of the U.S. Constitution a human life cannot be taken without judicial due process. If human life is taken without due process it is considered murder and is to be treated as such. With the progress of scientific technology we have indisputable evidence that at conception (the moment the human sperm and human egg join) a new human being (person) exists. The key parts to be passed by the State Legislature and then signed into law are declarations that a new human being (person) exists at the moment the human sperm and human egg join; and full Human Rights to the new human child is afforded as is afforded to all humans by the Constitution of the United States of America. These human rights for the new human person starts at the moment the human sperm and the human egg join. This then triggers a chain of events to take place. First a certificate of new human life is to be issued when the new life is detected. It follows all the procedures that a certificate of live birth does. As such in the event of death to this new human person a death certificate must be issued. All procedures for issuing said certificate must be followed. An autopsy must be done on the person to determine or verify the cause of death. All procedures that are to be performed in regards to the new human life are considered medical procedures and as such all procedural requirements as prescribed by the governing medical board of the United States of America and/or the state of residence would be required. A declaration of medical procedure is to take place. This would require that any and all procedures performed in regards to the health and wellbeing of the new human person are recorded and reported as are all other medical procedures. All actions to be considered as it pertains to the new human person are to be strictly governed by the court and the court alone. Attorneys for the new human person are to be appointed by the court or hired by a parent or relative or interested party. All representation of the new human person is to be done in the best interest of the new human person. This representation must be independent of and not limited to the mother father and the doctor involved. All of these discussions among the legal representatives doctors and parents are governed by the rules and laws of attorney-client privilege as well as doctor- client privilege. In conclusion this is by far the most extensive act of law ever to be proposed in regards to the protection of human life. There is a good deal of case law as well as proven scientific evidence to back up what this act can and will do to protect human life. It will if passed at the federal level supersede what some states have passed in recent months. Exceptions that may be added by the legislature In the case of a pregnancy that is caused by an alleged rape a criminal complaint must be filed with the police and a rape kit administered at a hospital. The request for an abortion can then be tracked back to the date of the police report and rape kit testing to determine the probability of cause. At this time a court could authorize an abortion. In the case of a pregnancy caused by an act of incest a DNA test in vitro can determine if a relative is truly the father. At this time a court could authorize an abortion. In the case of a threat to the mothers life if the pregnancy would go full term and the choice is that only the mother or the child will survive the family should decide. In the case of testing determining that the child will be severely handicapped or severely mentally impaired the choice is up to the family.,political,Facebook

"It's time to bring common sense solutions to the Capitol Dome. Several people have asked where I personally stand on certain topics and in doing so will share some common ones below;  I have (3) wonderful children that are the most proudest achievements of my life. My oldest is a freshman in college second in middle school and the third in elementary school who have attended and still attend public schools in both Kanawha and Putnam Counties. For any of you with children understand the obligation to leave this a better place than we grew up and create the environment for businesses to thrive. I'm living proof that public education still affords the same opportunities as private or charter schools. I was the last graduating class of DuPont High School in 1999 attended an HBCU West Virginia State College now WV State University graduating with honors Cum Laude in 2003 with a Bachelor's of Arts in Political Science and minors in Sociology and Psychology. I graduated in 2007 from Marshall University Graduate College with a Master's of Science in Human Resources Management and Industrial Employee Labor Relations. We need to seek out ways to invest in our public schools to enhance the learning and make sure our children are giving the capabilities to continue further and compete at the next level.  In terms of infrastructure we have the ability to be at the forefront of providing energy independence through the rich resources of Marcellus shell. Dr. Fiona Hill's testimony laid out the case for why we should continue drilling for Marcellus shell and the fact we have an abundance of it gives those in the coal mining industry the opportunity to continue making a good living without pulling the rug from underneath them and closing shop with no regard to their families and the impact economically on their communities.  Our roads should be maintained at all times to allow for normal driving conditions and not just get fixed during an election year. Our children should have the ability to attend public schools where learning and their ability to do so in a safe environment is of the utmost importance. That being said I proudly support the second amendment as I am a gun owner myself. Individuals should have the right to defend themselves in the event of immanent danger on their own property. Likewise we have a duty to ensure those who do obtain them are vetted to help minimize the loss of innocent lives and that they do not end up in the hands of those considered to be a threat from tools used to share information among law enforcement across state lines.  I was raised in a very Christian conservative family with 7 other siblings at Maranatha Fellowship Church for over 30 years under the ministry of Dr. James Wright Sr. In terms of Abortion I'm personally pro-life but also support Women's rights that it's a decision left up to the consenting adults. Just like several proponents who are staunch advocates of the government interfering with their ability to bare arms likewise should apply the same that government has no role to determine what any individual can or cannot do to their own body. Most folk agree that this is a sensitive private subject and should remain for those who have had the decision to do it voluntarily or due to medical reasons including unwanted advances. I've become more understanding after listening to some who have undergone this experience. However I do recognize the expressed concern of federal funding being obtained as this is not the viewpoint of all tax paying citizens.  In closing I want to thank those who took the time to read this short excerpt and welcome you to share your thoughts and encourage any suggestions you might have on improving things that are of concern in the 38th House District.

Important News Alert: Governor Coopers Veto has been Sustained!  Great news! Today the NC House of Representatives in a 67-53 vote sustained Governor Coopers Veto of the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. It takes a three-fifths majority vote from each chamber to override a Governors veto. There were only 2 Democrats who joined the Republicans in voting to override the Governors Veto they were Rep. Garland Pierce and Rep. Charles Graham. It is gratifying to see that the work of Governor Cooper in raising funds to break the Republican supermajority has finally proven to be successful. I would also like to thank all of those who worked so vigorously to get Democrats elected last year to the NC House and to the NC Senate. I simply hope that Democrats can stick together and support our Governor firmly each time he vetoes a bill to deliver a strong and compelling message to the Republican majority and the citizens of NC that we are now back on track in returning NC to its progressive legacy as a leading state in the South.,political,Facebook

Judge Renders Opinion on Arkansas Attorney Generals Cease and Desist Order of Surgical Abortions  Little Rock April 14 2020  U.S. District Judge Kristine Baker has ruled against the Arkansas Executive branch cease and desist order delivered to the Little Rock Family Planning Clinic to halt surgical abortions during the COVID 19 concern. Judge Baker delivered the opinion to block Governor Asa Hutchinson Attorney General Leslie Rutledge and the Arkansas Department of Health from suspending non-essential surgical abortions.  The limited record supports the ... allegation that enforcement of the (order) against LRFP will inflict serious physical emotional and psychological injuries on LRFPs patients by forcing them to delay or altogether forgo access to abortion care wrote Baker.  General Rutledge issued the cease and desist order last week under guidance from Governor Hutchinson who received reports from several legislators that the LRFPC was still performing surgical abortions despite an order to halt elective procedures.  The states top attorney responded to the judges opinion through her spokeswoman: Attorney General Rutledge is extremely disappointed in todays decision to blatantly disregard good public health guidelines and temporarily halt the Health Departments directive without allowing the State to be heard Amanda Priest said.  The Platform of the Republican Party of Arkansas articulates the Constitutional guarantee of separation of powers: the vibrancy and vitality of our republican form of limited government requires three separate and coequal branches (Legislative Executive Judicial) as spelled out in both the federal and state constitutions. Through a robust system of checks and balances no one branch of government - whether located in Washington D.C. or Little Rock - should wield more authority than the other two.

Too many politicians are afraid to say it but I will: Abortion is evil. It is the greatest evil of our time. Tens of thousands of children are murdered every day. One party is actively trying to expand it. The other is trying to stop it. I know who Im with. How about you?,political,Facebook
"THE DEVIL'S CARDS ARE SHOWING... I have a sense that all of these 'radical pro-abortion' laws and decisions are a show of cards... Satan knows 'his time is short'... he also knows that legalized abortion is being exposed as an 'uncivilized' inhumane barbaric practice... Americans are waking up! So as pattern dictates he resorts to what he knows and starts killing because ""he has been a murderer from the beginning."" Though recent decisions in favor of extreme-late term abortion are repulsive and shocking... these become the historical moments of a heavenly response!! The blood of Jesus will have its say over our nation!!! deliverers are coming and the lives in the womb will once again find the dream of God!",political,Facebook
"The Bible tells us in 0 uncertain terms when life begins. In the start of Genesis God makes it very clear he forms a figure from the Earth but it does not become Adam (man) until God ""breathes into him the breath of life & he became man.  As we can see life begins when you draw your first breath. That is when scripturally God places your spirit in your body. Your spirit enters your body with your first breath & it leaves with your last. Our bodies are just a vessel our being our humanity is our immortal soul. That's what the Bible says & for the life of me I cannot understand why so many especially those of supposedly Abrahamic faith get this wrong. There is no question no moral ambiguity. Abortion destroys an empty vessel it does not kill a human being. If you dont want one dont get one. The left & right are having a hard time grasping the concept of freedom of choice when it relates to medical practice.  As a Buddhist myself my faith as it relates to most my fellow Buddhists is more dogmatically in favor of a fetus existence though according to the 14th Dalai Lama while he views abortion as a negative act of killing he currently makes exceptions if the fetus is genetically defective or if birth will threaten the life of the mother. Amazing how his holiness the 14th Dalai Lama can understand better than Arizona Republicans the illogical nature of suffering a living soul to a genetically defective vessel. Root vegetables such as potatoes are soulless organisms traditionally my religion opposes their consumption due to their connection with earth still I enjoy the hell out of French fries. I firmly believe in the separation of church & state even though my religion in particular makes much stronger defenses for fetuses dogmatically as well as root vegetables.",political,Facebook
The Independence Party is neutral on abortion issues and would support candidates on either side of the issue. That said I do want to comment on the new Texas anti-abortion law. In an attempt to prevent courts from enjoining Texas from enforcing the new law the state has set it up in a way that the state does not enforce this new law. Instead the law is intended to be enforced by allowing any citizen to sue any one who is involved in an abortion except for the woman who is getting it. I can not think of any other legislation that specifically allows a party who was not harmed to sue someone. It seems to me that if this law survives court challenges it could set a new precedent that could be used for any number of controversial laws. I am boosting this post hoping some attorneys might see it and comment on this aspect of the law.,political,Facebook
Arkansas State Senator Calls for the Abolition of Abortion Little Rock April 11 2020  While investigating the last remaining surgical abortion clinic in Arkansas on Friday State Senator Jason Rapert called for the abolition of abortion in that state.  Several state legislators visited the site with Senator Rapert to observe that the Little Rock Family Planning Clinic was continuing to perform abortions despite an order from the Arkansas Department of Health. Following guidance from Governor Asa Hutchinson the Department issued a directive mandating the postponement of all procedures that are not immediately medically necessary during the COVID-19 emergency.  The clinic continued to operate in defiance of this mandate. Many clients had driven from neighboring states seeking abortions despite similar directives from those state governments. On April 10 Attorney General Leslie Rutledge sent a cease and desist order to the Little Rock Family Planning Clinic.  Senator Rapert began a livestream to chronicle the clinics Health Department violation during which he called for the abolition of abortion. I want you to pray that regardless of the short term issues here that some day in the future this clinic would absolutely no longer exist. We should abolish abortion the senator said.  Call and e-mail Senator Rapert and thank him for his stand against abortion. Tell him you support the immediate and total abolition of abortion in Arkansas in the 2021 Legislative Session.

"Received a comment that I haven't addressed these issues though I have in previous post. I will pin this post and place it the group titles ""issues"".  Your page only shows that you are pro guns will only sit for two terms.  What is your position on rights for LGBTQ persons? ANSWER: Are they human? Yes? Then they have as equal right to be happy as you and I.  What is your position on gay marriage? ANSWER: The state has no need to be in the marriage business. We should not seek permission to be able to marry and be happy to whoever we want to be with.  What is your position on abortion? ANSWER: Pro Life but we need to change the way we attack Roe v Wade. More state laws that we know will fail is wasting time and taxpayer money.  What is your position on funding planned parenthood? ANSWER: Defund and plan a new program that will provide the same services important to women's health that does not have abortion on its list of services.  What is your position on expanding Medicare for all? ANSWER: This sounds great. How shall we pay for this in our state? Let's legalize Marijuana Gambling etc... Then maybe we can afford it.  What is your position on immigration? ANSWER: I support legal immigration. I would also support the state in developing a program to help put people on the track to citizenship. I support closing the border as other civilized countries have done. We know we have illegals here in Georgia that is evident on large farms.  What would you do if an armed group of individuals were to camp out on the state capital steps with full militia gear and demand something of our state officials? ANSWER: Are they peaceful? Are they exercising their 1st Amendment rights as a group of citizens? If so I would venture out with a gun on my hip and talk to them. Why would I carry my gun?

Unfortunately Governor Beshear callously vetoed SB-9 the Born Alive Protection Act. I was proud to vote for this bill. Governor Beshear's veto of this bill is both disheartening and disgusting but not surprising. His refusal to close abortion clinics when he forced the stoppage of elective medical procedures was telling.  As your State Representative I pledge to not seek the endorsement nor accept contributions to my campaign from any organization that affiliates itself with Planned Parenthood. I also pledge to never make a political contribution to a pro-choice candidate. I anticipate the endorsement of my campaign by the Kentucky Right to Life Association in this race because of my solid voting record and commitment to protecting the innocent unborn.,political,Facebook

"Please Like Follow Share & Visit Were YOU bought? Who owns YOU? Foreign Money Election Campaign Donations are illegal What is foreign money? In the strict legal sense foreign money cannot enter any federal state or local elections. Campaigns may not solicit or accept contributions from foreign nationals. Federal law prohibits contributions donations expenditures and disbursements solicited directed received or made directly or indirectly by or from foreign nationals in connection with any election  federal state or local. This prohibition includes contributions or donations made to political committees and building funds and to make electioneering communications. A foreign national is: An individual who is not a citizen of the United States and not lawfully admitted for permanent residence (as defined in 8 U.S.C.  1101(a)(20)); or A foreign principal as defined in 22 U.S.C.  611(b). Section 611 defines a foreign principal as a group organized under the laws of a foreign country or having its principal place of business in a foreign country. The statute specifically mentions foreign governments political parties partnerships associations and corporations. The intent of this law is to prevent the foreign influence of federal state and local elections. The question becomes what is foreign influence? From where? And how does that foreign influence affect elections? The federal law points to the exclusion of foreign nationals and foreign organizations. This law stops the influx of money from foreign outside sources that would enter and control the outcome of all jurisdictional elections in America. We understand the law very clearly when it relates to those foreign individual parties and organizations from outside the United States. But what about money from those foreign individuals and organizations inside the United States and from outside a certain state election or outside of a Congressional district or City Council territory? The legal definition of foreign is another jurisdiction. Therefore wouldnt money from outside of an election jurisdiction within the United States be considered foreign money too? Since outside territory money would influence another non-related voting territorys election the answer should be YES. It is only logical that the Federal laws intent must be extended to not only include foreign nationals and foreign organizations but to also to include those American individuals and American organizations that are also outside of any state and local election as well. We should also consider foreign American money that comes from outside of a state or local jurisdiction election illegal. Why must all foreign money be eliminated from all elections? The perfect example is happening in Virginia right now between 2017 to 2020. Non-Virginia Special interest individuals and organizations from New York and California are flooding Virginia candidates at the state and local levels with a lot of money to push their foreign outsider non-Virginia agendas. Candidates running for office when they win must take an oath of office to represent their constituents in Virginia their districts and their localities. This oath is violated by the impropriety or appearance of impropriety of that foreign money that is introduced into those Virginia state or local elections in order to sell those non-Virginia or non-local agenda items to those Virginia state or local elected officials in exchange for foreign money campaign donations. This is wrong and must be considered illegal. We must apply the same intent of the foreign national individual and foreign organization to the American individual and American Company within Virginia state and local elections. Outside foreign money that enters an election from another state or location from other than where the election is taking place buying politicians and influence is bribery with foreign money. How much money? 2019 Virginia State elections are the most recent and best example of foreign state money. During September [2019] the 128 Democratic candidates for the Virginia House and Senate received about 2500 donations totaling almost $3.34 million from outside Virginia Democrats got nearly $2 million from donors in D.C. almost $567000 from New York and $263000 from California as well as donations from 43 other states. Republicans on the other hand raised about $614000 from supporters in D.C. $53000 from Georgia $24000 from Florida and smaller amounts from 32 other states Everytown for Gun Safety a group that was founded by New York businessman Michael Bloomberg and advocates for universal background checks on firearms purchases and other gun control measures made 26 donations totaling almost $500000 to Democratic legislative candidates in Virginia last month records show. Other out-of-state organizations that made monetary donations of at least $50000 to Democrats were: EMILYs List a D.C.-based group that funds women candidates who support abortion rights  13 donations totaling $766000.Democracy PAC a D.C.-based committee affiliated with Democrats  15 donations totaling $575000The Service Employees International Union of New York  171 donations totaling about $318000The Future Now Fund a D.C.-based organization that supports progressive candidates  18 donations totaling $117500The 314 Action Victory Fund a D.C.-based group concerned about climate change  two donations totaling $75000The Green Advocacy Project a California-based environmental group  five donations totaling $50000. Only one out-of-state group contributed more than $50000 to Republican candidates in September: the Republican State Leadership Committee based in Washington. It made 12 donations totaling $585000. Six out-of-state individuals each gave Virginia Democrats at least $25000 last month. They included John Frantz a retired business executive in Massachusetts who made 27 donations totaling $73500 and Lisa Mennet a mental health care advocate in Seattle Washington with six donations totaling $51000. The biggest out-of-state donation that Virginia Republicans received in September was $4000 from Tatnall Hillman a retiree in Massachusetts. ""Most Republicans were being outspent in the House [of Delegates] and [state] Senate as Democrats from across the country piled on. It's not that Republicans don't have the resources they just didn't put them into Virginia."" In September 2019 Democrats running for the General Assembly reported raising a combined $8.1 million during September. Republicans raised a combined $4.6 million. In September 2019 alone about 28% of Virginia General Assembly campaign donations came from outside Virginia. Of the $66 million raised for the 2017 Virginia Governors race $33 million came from out of state donors. This means that at least 50% of the political influence is coming from outside the state of Virginia; having the effect of outsider mandates on how Virginians must live their lives. This was NEVER the intent of the founding fathers for State and local government. Our founding fathers and current laws intent are clear no foreign meddling in any elections; federal state and local. This is NOT acceptable. This is out of state and out of local jurisdiction election meddling. Out of state individuals and organizations must never influence Virginia elections laws and policy. These individuals and organizations are not residents or headquartered in Virginia do not pay income tax in Virginia and have no vested interest in Virginia citizens and their quality of life. These are foreign individuals and organizations trying to thrust their ideology and agenda onto Virginia. When an outside individual or organization writes a large check to a candidate what do they expect? Does their money come with no strings attached? Of course not. These outside entities would NOT give if they were not assured their special interest legislation or agenda. This is truly an unlawful quid pro quo. Politicians are clearly being bought to vote for out of state special interest legislation. The most obvious foreign state money infiltration was done by Democrat Presidential Candidate Michael Bloombergs EveryTown USA gun confiscation efforts. During the 2/25/20 Democrat Presidential Primary Debate Bloomberg admitted by stating that he bought 21 Congressional freshmen seats from around the country. Everytown gave $2.5 million to Virginia Democratic candidates who ran on a gun safety platform. As a result the group said it was the largest outside donor in the states election.  Foreign state money campaign donations violate every oath of office and should be criminal. Virginia is ground zero for the 2nd Amendment Right to Bear Arms. There were huge pro-gun and other legislation rallies opposing these foreign entity special interest agendas. Virginians will never let their Constitutional Rights be stolen by any foreign individual or corporation. Foreign State money campaign donations must not continue and must no longer be tolerated.  How can we fix this? Eliminating outside money in state and local elections is simple. Virginia has some of the loosest spending regulations in the country. The state has practically no oversight to ensure candidates dont use their campaign funds for their own personal use. It is also one of only eleven states to allow individuals to make unlimited contributions to campaigns. Tighten these regulations. These practices must stop and new laws preventing foreign money must be enacted. State lawmakers must write non-ambiguous and non-conflicting laws and enforce them. The framework for corporations already exist. When an outside corporation enters another state to do business they are referred to as a foreign corporation legal entity . These foreign corporations must register as foreign entities and must pay a foreign corporation registration fee to do business within the outside state. Therefore if corporations that are located in a different state are foreign corporations then why isnt campaign donation money coming from another state foreign money? Outside state money really is foreign state money and must be outlawed.  What can you do? Send your letters to Richmond demanding that NO outside foreign state or local jurisdiction campaign donation money be allowed to be offered to and accepted by Virginia State and local candidates.",political,Facebook
A NEW YEAR BRINGS OLD CHALLENGES TO AN ARROGANT TWIN-ISLAND REPUBLIC (Part two of two); by Rock Hermon Hackshaw. Last month after I published part one of this column it drew some strange responses from a handful of puzzling (to me) readers. I must now deviate -a bit- from my original intent in order to clear up some misconceptions as to my motivation(s) and such. The phrase used to describe Trinidad as the most arrogant little island in the Caribbean Sea was coined by none other than Harry Belafonte- the internationally famous calypsonian/entertainer. I concur; and I offer no apologies. Look; the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago has a crime problem: a major one. This is no idle speculation but fait-accompli. This problem has been around for quite a while now and successive political regimes have failed to get a handle on it; far less solve it. In the last column I expressed that T&T is generally on the top-ten list of the most murderous countries (per capita) in the world and that this phenomenon has been somewhat of a recurring decimal since the new millennium began. The fact that even now -years into this crisis- there are Trinbagonians still in relative denial only strengthens my point as to the arrogance of too many citizens. If there was one message I had hoped readers would extrapolate from part one of this column it was this: I strongly believe the time has come for a unified approach to the nations crime problem from the total citizenry. Here is what I mean: It is time to transcend racial issues put aside ideological differences suspend personal invectives and delay political competitivity in order to collectively tackle crime in a civic way. It should be made the top national priority item of the day. Higher on the totem pole than even environmental/ecological challenges. Higher than economic concerns even. I intend to write another column on this issue soon enough wherein I will try to offer some concrete suggestions as to a way forward. Some readers have privately asked me to expound on the genesis of this crime wave; so let me facilitate them. Research shows that the larger island (Trinidad) has a reputation -going way back to the seventeenth century- of being a magnet for many of societys undesirables misfits vagabonds and outcasts. The island also had a reputation for having a high population of mixed-race residents: a general description which included those of differing ethnicities nationalities and creeds. This is a phenomenon that can be observed even today. As colonial possessions of Spain both islands were quietly ignored by their colonial master. There werent lots of agricultural products heading to Madrid from either Port of Spain or Scarboroughs ports. There wasnt any gold or silver to speak about far less ship out. And at that point in time neither the natural asphalt from La Breas wonder of the world pitch-lake nor the black gold (oil) seeping out of the ground in many other southern areas of Trinidad were considered economic assets. Sure there was farming and other agricultural activities taking place; but not on the same scale as most other Caribbean islands. Consider that by the time Emancipation ended in 1838 the island of Jamaica -only two and a half times larger in size- had more than twenty times a higher slave population than Trinidad and Tobago. Its one of the reasons why more indentured laborers from India ended up in Trinidad when compared to other islands. Research has also shown that during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries there were more residents of here speaking French (as their main language) rather than Spanish. This occurred even though Spain always controlled administration of both islands with a governorship based in Trinidad. One fateful day in 1797 Ralph Abercromby a Scottish-born admiral of the British navy pulled into Chaguramas Bay on the north-western side of Trinidad. He had one large warship and had essentially gone rogue from his chain of command. He dropped anchor and sent an envoy to the Spanish Governor (named Chacon) who resided in a north-eastern town called Saint Joseph: the capital then. The envoys message was in fact a complete bluff. He informed Chacon that a fleet of many more British warships would be arriving soon enough with the objective of razing the island and imposing British rule. Chacon was told that the only guarantee of safe evacuation for he and his people could be fulfilled there and then: were they to immediately evacuate. The envoy further posited that it would be futile to mount a defense since the island was relatively unfortified with a mere sprinkling of canons situated in some rather questionable defensive-positions. Chacon and his peeps were out of there in no time flat; and Trinidad was conquered without a single shot being fired. This started British rule as accepted by historians. There is a footnote which can also be added to this. Research also shows that there were other attempts to wrest Trinidad and Tobago from Spain. It is written that French British and Dutch adventurers tried -but failed- on many occasions prior to Abercrombys successful bluff. Thus just like today temptation(s) ran amok even then. In 1802 the Treaty of Amiens deemed Trinidad a British colony; and ceded the Brits the island of Tobago also. To me this was an oddity since amongst the warring European powers sitting around that bargaining table neither the Dutch French Russians or others (beyond Britain) had any legitimate claim(s) to these two islands. The competing European powers simply screwed Spain which at that point in time was recognized as the worlds number one super-power. Interestingly enough the treaty only lasted about 15 months; but from there on in Britain had uninterrupted rule over both islands. Scholars note that in 1889 the islands were officially conjoined; and that on August 31st 1962 they were granted independence from Britain; while remaining members of the larger British Commonwealth of nations. Eighteen days later they became members of the United Nations and in 1967 they joined the Organization of American States (OAS). In August of 1976 T&T became a Republic. Many academics trace the beginnings of lawlessness in T&T and other Third-World countries all the way back to the end of World War 2. They also cite (and link) the various movements for independence in the numerous colonies. The claim is that the political retreat(s) of European colonial masters left power-vacuums which created political tensions amongst classes religions races tribes and ethnicities. In many instances this has led to violence and lawlessness. In the nineteen-sixties and seventies the civil rights struggle of black-Americans in the USA (United States of Amnesia) and the parallel rise of various individual black-power political movements captured the imagination(s) of many in the African diaspora. Understandably and predictably there were social economic and political upheavals (some violent) all around the globe. Trinidad and Tobago had its share of political unrest back in the nineteen-seventies. There were lots of vocal demonstrations spontaneous black-power marches thunderous anti-government protests and sporadic labor-unrest. There were those who harbored ideas of overthrowing the democratically elected government while others simply tried to make political mileage out of the chaos. Large caches of guns and other ammunition were found all over the larger island. States of Emergency were regularly imposed by the authorities. Law-enforcement and military-personnel were given abnormal powers. Curfews and basic-martial-law were imposed from time to time and the populace in general suffered through the overall tension wherein dissidents were routinely imprisoned and brutalized. Objectively speaking there were relatively few attendant mortalities but it was chaotic nonetheless. Law-enforcement and security forces were taxed in unprecedented ways; and in retrospect things could have been much worse; but it was still a terrible and a sordid chapter in the history of T&T. There is no doubt in my mind that the twin-islands of Trinidad and Tobago lost their innocence during the nineteen-seventies. And as the saying goes: innocence is like virginity; once lost it is never ever regained. It is very possible that as a country we may one day return to the stress-less simplicity of T&T-life of yesteryear(s); but our innocence is gone; and profoundly missed nowadays. The slow descent into the crime-abyss started somewhere in this decade (70s) and slowly worsened in subsequent decades. When we got to the nineteen-nineties a double-whammy was unleashed via two bills passed in the US Congress. They were signed into law by then president Bill Clinton. In my estimation this was the coup de grace relative to the crime-surge experienced by Caribbean and Latin American nations since the new millennium. During the nineteen-eighties the USA experienced an explosion in the usage of an illegal drug known as crack. It was a derivative from the drug cocaine. This explosion led to an epidemic which in turn fueled a crime-wave. The murder-rate skyrocketed mainly because of the attendant violence and ancillary crimes. The main governmental response in the USA -at all three levels- was to pass harsh laws against illegal drug-usage and to stiffen sentences for those involved in the drug-trade and other linked crimes. Legislation like the three strike rule emerged. An individual who committed three felonies could encounter a lengthy prison term (punishment included life-sentences even). Social upheavals and specific socio-cultural trends can be traced right back to these policy-shifts. In 1994 President Bill Clinton signed a Crime Bill which was really an immigration-reform bill in disguise. Immigrants were faced with deportation for committing some of the most rudimentary of misdemeanors. These deportations -in turn- impacted home-countries to no end. Then in 1996 President Clinton signed an anti-terrorism bill which was (again) another immigration-reform bill in disguise. What many people missed was the main objective behind both bills: to have better control on the influx of non-whites to the USA. Back in the early nineteen-seventies right-wing think-tanks (mainly comprised of Caucasian males) were projecting that by the year 2020 one out of every two American babies born would be non-white. They were concerned that demographic shifts will lead to a county wherein the white population will eventually be subsumed by a non-white majority. Amongst the factors cited were immigration patterns birth-control practices by whites laisse-faire abortion policies in most states and a higher birth rate amongst Hispanic migrants -arriving in droves- from Latin America. Back then the illegal-alien problem on the southern borders was arguably ten times worse than it is today. These two bills which Bill Clinton signed were in reality conservative political responses to demographic shifts: worrisome to the white-supremacists and their ideals. The aim was to stem the flow of non-whites into the USA. However there were unanticipated consequences which impacted many countries outside North America. Mass deportation measures had a visible effect on crime in the countries where most deportees were shipped. The Caribbean islands were not spared. The one country in the Western Hemisphere that ostensibly prepared for the socio-politico-economic-cultural impact of returnees was Argentina. Government policy in that country dealt with absorbing and reacclimating those who had very few links to a country they had left many many years before. Job-training programs housing health-care (including mental-health/counselling) employment opportunities and the like were features of this policy. As such the crime wave experienced by most other countries essentially evaded Argentinians. Consider Argentinas approach to this problem with the non-approach of the previous T&T government. A few years ago T&Ts prime minister then (Ms. Kamla Persad-Bissessar) addressed a Brooklyn audience primarily made up of folks born on the twin-islands. When questioned as to her plans for dealing with deportees from the USA she retorted (to the questioner): why are you so concerned about them? She impetuously implied that the questioner should be more concerned with those who had been there throughout. It was an answer lacking both depth and compassion and it was a display of the type of T&T arrogance of which I speak. A look at crime stats since 1994 -in most countries situated in the Western Hemisphere- shows the clear co-relation(s) between (1) these two aforementioned bills President Clinton signed into law;(2) a significant uptick in deportations from the USA and (3) a rise in crime in the countries most impacted by these deportations. In my last column I gave about 25 consecutive years of T&T murder stats and also sprinkled some kidnapping numbers within. During the past decade T&T has had a low solve-rate relative to murders. In fact my research showed that only Peru appeared to have had a lower solve-rate. By solve rate I mean the entire law-enforcement process: from a specific criminal act of murder to the investigation to an arrest to a trial and then conviction/punishment. In Peru the solve rate has gotten to as low as ten per cent. In T&T that number has been stuck in the teens for some time now. This means that there are lots of people walking around who have apparently gotten away with murder. This is a daunting revelation for two islands as small as these. Over the last quarter-century the T&T republic has experienced way over five thousand murders. My research has been unable to detail even one thousand murder convictions during this period. I challenge my detractors to disprove this. As far as I can ascertain there is a backlog of pending murder cases on the criminal-docket. Therein lies another problem which I pointed out in my first column: In T&T much needed change moves along at molasses pace. The social economic political and cultural effects of repatriating lawbreakers to unwelcoming shores isnt the main reason why crime has exploded in T&T. Truth be told the main factor fueling the crime surge is the lucrative albeit illegal-drug-trade. T&Ts proximity to Columbia and other Latin American countries -which are the main suppliers of illegal drugs to Europe and North America- has created an environment wherein involvement in the drug business has been irresistible to far too many corrupt weaklings. Before we can begin to solve this crime-problem T&T citizens need to do some honest in-depth introspection. Over recent years European and Asian countries have issued advisories and warnings to their citizens travelling to Trinidad and Tobago; all because of the crime situation. Canada and the USA have also issued similar communiques from time to time. These columns I now write are meant to edify and inform. They are not meant to disrespect T&T citizens and expatriates. They are not meant to ridicule anyone. Trinidad is a special place for me but I will always tell it like it is. I will write it or say it as I see fit; then I will duck and take cover from the incoming fire. I truly question the intelligence and honesty of those who critiqued my first column on this topic. A new year has indeed brought old challenges to an arrogant twin-island republic. Stay tuned-in folks. I will do one more column on this topic next month. *********************************************************************************,political,Facebook

"RANDOM PSYCHOLOGY 82 Before I get you and myself in deeper waters let me say this first ""anyone  male or female that physically rapes (however whatever the method or purpose) a child under the age of eight should be given the death penalty no if ands or buts regardless of the reason or personal status wealth history of abuse  except for a prior and well established history of mental defect or deficiency. When you start to believe a lie it becomes difficult for you to believe the facts that contradict your beliefs it is the old game you buy into a lie and if I try to offer contradictory evidence I become part of the conspiracy to fool you  and to cover up. So there is that that is why the conspiracy theories don't die Sandy Hook 9/11 the Illuminati the Deep State are all real anyone saying different is part of the plot ( I can see you are paying attention). We can't really blame the internet even in the stone age people would gather around and someone will tell a tall tale and take would be repeated endlessly each person adding some more details and there would be people believing the story and pretty soon the fiction would become the conventional wisdom the fact and real. It is no different today the idiots on the keyboard will see something that purports to support their idiocies and they will pass the story around as fact and the fiction becomes their truth start the Salem witch trials bring out the lynch mobs whatever turns you on. Be it the illegal immigrants taking away jobs and simultaneously receiving welfare benefits and committing all the crime or the police committing murders willyBilly or the violent crime being out of control all are acceptable facts though they are not facts at all. Back in eighties there was a sudden outbreak of stories about child molestations ""the daycares were involved nationwide"" hundreds of investigations by all the law enforcement didn't produce anything but still lives got destroyed businesses ruined a few people even went to jails in trumped up charges. The fad also gave a rise to a phenomenon called ""Repressed Memories"" and a lot of men especially older one were tried convicted and sent to prison where some psychologists ""recovered"" these from the female generally middle aged victims. Destroying lives homes and relationships.  Some people are willing to believe anything that is totally baseless or utterly stupid just to be different. Or accepted in a group and so as to feel smarter than they really are. In my ""short lived"" practice in psychology I noticed that many psychologists had their own personal agendas and prejudices that they would implant in their clients thereby increasing the problems of the client transposing their pathologies and creating issues that did not previously exist. With freedom comes responsibility without responsibility we lose our freedoms. Understanding freedom requires education and thinking a less than well ""educated"" person will not understand the limits and transgress. In my twenty plus years of writing and blogging I have constantly emphasized the ""boundaries of character""  some people call it morals but I am not religious or moral I am just barely smart enough to understand what is wrong and what is right I define it as what if someone else did this to me? Would I like it to be known by all and most importantly am I stepping on somebody else's toes or territory. We live in a ""society"" a society is defined by its rules and boundaries if we live in a subdivision we have to follow the rules of the HOA right? So is the case for the society at large with a few exceptions to be made so we can have everyone included and no one is excluded. We are of course ""one nation"" right. Yet we are in trouble on two counts one there are some that want to make all the rules for the rest to follow ( even under the threat of violence) and two there are some that say I can do whatever I want and no rule should apply to me. Neither situation is workable. Everything in your life is a lesson right or wrong good or bad we learn something hopefully what we do with that lesson depends totally on our intelligence and our intentions. I have written about sex and sexuality before good and bad  ask for a link if you like even if out of curiosity as to how I think. I grew up a hippie experimented and learned a few lessons. What works what does not work how it effects our lives  the lives of others lives of our kids our partners you may be surprised. All this to make this point what is pedophilia and what to do about it and the pedophiles.  What is a ""child""? What is consent? What about physiology? What is good? What is bad? What is right? What is wrong? What is trafficking? How big is the problem? Where is the real problem? We really don't know don't want to know we make laws to cover it all and destroy good with the bad. There is no good child molestation rest. Earlier today I posted Leviticus 18 I am not religious this is not a religious debate I posted it to point out that many of its prohibitions are a joke today it is not uncommon for a man to have sex with a mother and her daughter or a woman to have sex with a man and his son step brothers and sisters to have sex. Aunt and nephew uncle and niece not as rare as we think. We laugh about a woman having sex with a thirteen year old boy and it is only a crime if an older man gets caught or is reported for having sex with a girl over 14. I could give you examples but you watch the news or know the people in your community even your relatives. But if you take a picture of your naked 2 year old child you can be busted for producing and possessing child pornography. I shouldn't have to parse my words and stratify and classify different forms of pedophilia and child abuse but we do not have a universal definition nor do we have a standard meaning of the phrase different people do have different definitions and opinions about what is or is not pedophilia what is child sex what is child abuse and what role anyone or any phenomenon plays. If two 11 year olds of any gender are engaged in any sexual behavior what would you call it? What about a 12 and a 14 year old? How about a sex partner of a parent holding a nine year old on their lap while the two are minimally dressed? What about an 8 and a 12 year old siblings changing in presence of eachother. Or an 8 and a 10 year old bathing together.  It is not my intention to make light of the child molestation or pedophilia it is worthy of all the panic and attention it has and deserves but some are spreading and falling for sensationalism pedophilia is a fact I am writing about it but stay with the real. Some are trying to make it a much bigger issue only to make the democrats look bad and promote the pizzagate conspiracy theory. When your attention is diverted you miss the mark keep your focus on the problem. If we are taking a worldwide number then say that not many will look up the facts and will just assume the number relates to the US. There are many kids in the third world and even in America that are abandoned that are run aways that are kidnapped by non custodial parent In America the teen runaways are generally found within few days sometimes they refuse to go back to their families there is sex trafficking in the far east in south America our ""tourists"" go there to buy young children the problem thus is much more involved and complicated. Even though the allegations against Epstien may be truly factual and a lot of powerful people maybe involved making it a partisan issue is not productive. That is my basic contention look at all those involved and let the chips fall where they may. One thing we need to make clear even the DSM was called out on defining ""pedophilia"" as one term without regard to sexual development and age differences many recently (since pizzagate and subsequently the Epstein saga) have misused the term pedophilia to define sex with even 14 15 and 16 year olds. That is a misuse of term pedophilia is sex with prepubescent and the infantophillia for sex with children under five I stated earlier that we should separate the two with the age of eight as the line of separation. I am in no way encouraging or promoting sex with minors but lumping it all together is a stretch and we open a can of worm that we all could fall into as in the examples I gave above.  I started writing on this last night will add more as I find time  M. N. R. 10 AUGUST 2020  If you noticed where I had said that it should not be made a partisan issue. Today there were headline that Qanon is trying to hijack the issue. This is not news what issue has not been hijacked and destroyed after being made a partisan issue. I have written about this phenomenon before. The deficits and the Tea party the ERA and the feminists the abortion and the religious right the war on drugs the BLM  the list is long and we keep going in circles and we keep getting lost. #SAVETHECHILDREN sounds like a great idea until we realize we have no idea what we are talking about. The numbers are huge but we don't know what these numbers refer to. We really don't. Are we talking about the #American kids only? The kids that are kidnapped and sold only the kids that are victims of wars and famine? The kids that are kept in cages what kids? How old are they? Sixteen is the normal age of consent in the United States so if a sixteen year old has consensual relation with a sixty year old there is nothing you can do about it. Is it about sexism? There are girls that work at Hooters at strip clubs get in wet T shirt contests to make living are we policing these? If a sixty year old man goes to a house of prostitution in Thailand in India in South America or in the US he is not looking for a 70 year old great grandma are we going to police that also? Many runaways turn to trading bodies for food shelter and spending money what are we doing. We support wars we support and create poverty misery pain and suffering child trafficking is a part of the bargain where do we stand. In Iraq in Afghanistan in Syria Somalia Yemen central American countries in the far east sex trafficking of children has been a direct result of our foreign policy what do we do? I am not complaining about our roles I am not suggesting changes I am not blaming I am only pointing out the hypocrisy. We have kids in state custody we have kids in ICE custody we have kids in court system all being abused and exploited what are we doing? Our leaders have offered no solutions not even plans not taken any steps and here we are talking about ""save the children"" and we don't know what are we talking about. M. N.

I was recently asked to share my story on abortion and as I stood there I was aware of all of the pain in the room. I stood there and gave honor to my parents who as teens made a decision to keep me rather then abort me. I will eternally honor them for this beautiful life that I have regardless of where the journey takes me. As a young teen I had an abortion on a kitchen table and I can still remember them boiling the hanger. I never wanted anyone to know and I was angry at those who set up the woman to do the abortion. As I stood on the platform sharing my story I also saw the many tears of the women sitting there. For many we held that secret and we stuffed it down not wanting to go there. I am grateful to God that He is a safe place and that when we open up and share our secrets with Him He comes near to the broken hearted and He heals He forgives He redeems and He lifts us from the ash heap. Allow God in your every part and never keep anything from Him. He loves you just the way you are! ,political,Facebook

Do you believe abortion is murder? If so then you undermine yourself if you don't believe the murderer should be punished. Abolitionists are not asking for any new laws. We only want to be consistent and have the existing laws against murder applied to everyone. And it wouldn't be made retroactive. Once the laws change everyone would know the risks just as they do now if they decided to murder their two year old. If we truly believe abortion is murder and those in the womb deserve equal justice under law then the murderers must be punished as though they are murdering born people.  Sadly the pro-life movement does not believe in equal justice under law. They are opposing legislation for the total abolition of abortion as the don't believe murderous parents deserve punishment. They are undermining their own rhetoric and are keeping abortion safe and legal indefinitely.  Abortion must be abolished.  #BeConsistent,political,Facebook
New to the page? Need to know where I stand on some of the issues?   Abortion - the mothers right to choose ends at the babies right to life. You skipped plan A (keep ya legs closed) you skipped plan A.25 (use protection) then you conveniently skipped plan B. You've run out of choice and plan's lady.  2nd Amendment - Pick a gun. Any gun. That's your gun now. Red flag laws? Unconstitutional. I'll fight those and bans on anything to do with guns tooth and nail.  Illegal Aliens - Finish the wall then deport them ALL. No more legislation. The best nation on Earth should NOT be easy to come to. Fight to make your own nation better.  Healthcare - Send the entire issue to the states. Do away with HHS.  Education - Send the entire issue to the states. Do away with DOE.  Military - Ensure that our military comes second to none.  Spending - Just cut it. Many agencies and departments look ripe. REAL ripe for the pickings.  Debt - Stop borrowing. If we can't afford it we can't afford it. We've survived over 200 years without it we can go a couple hundred more without it. No more raising the debt ceiling.  Economy - Ensure that the economic climate is such that jobs may be maintained competition is plenty and wages are rising.  Welfare - drug test screening time limits (if you are not elderly or disabled) no unhealthy food/drinks using food stamps. But eventually sending this too back to the states.  Foreign Assistance - If nations that are our allies need help and we can help we should. But it should not always be guaranteed. And no nation hostile to us or our values have a hope of getting a dime from us.  War - While we don't seek them we will protect ourselves and our interest. With one objective... Neutralizing the threat. No nation building.  Immigration - Come one come all but don't show up here asking what we can do for you. Ask yourself what you can do for us. We will not make our immigration laws 'easier'. It defeats the purpose. May as well not have any.  Trade - Tariff free trade is the only way to real and lasting trade.  Did I make it Plain enough?

BREAKING NEWS: (October 10 2020 Little Rock) Today the Ouachita Baptist Association unanimously approved a resolution calling on the Arkansas State government to immediately and totally abolish abortion in our state. The State Convention of Southern Baptists of Arkansas was cancelled for the year but that convention had planned to consider a similar resolution. Ouachita Baptist Association consists of 21 Southern Baptist churches in western Arkansas. The full text of the resolution appears at the end of this article.  Among other statements the Resolution recognizes that every human being is made in the image of God and possesses innate dignity that equal justice should be established for all of Gods image bearers that failing to provide equal protection under the law violates Gods standard of justice that abortion is a gospel issue and that whenever mans laws conflict with those of the Almighty civil legislators have a right and an obligation to obey God instead of man.  Similar resolutions were also recently approved by both the Arkansas and Oklahoma Free Will Baptist Associations.  We encourage you to follow Christ in this endeavor and to ask your state representative and state senator to support the IMMEDIATE and TOTAL abolition of abortion in Arkansas.

(Rom 2:14-16; Gen 3:1) and  (4) WHEREAS to murder any preborn image-bearer is a sin violating both the natural law of retributive justice as set forth in the Noahic covenant as well as the sixth commandment forbidding murder and as such is ultimately an assault on Gods image seeking to usurp Gods sovereignty as Creator (Gen 9:5-6; Exodus 20:13; Proverbs 6:17) and  (5) WHEREAS Gods Word clearly declares that all human life is a sacred gift and that His Law is supreme over mans life and mans law (Psalms 127:3-5; 139:13-16; Rom 2:15-16; Acts 10:42; 17:31; 1 Corinthians 4:5) and  (6) WHEREAS God commands His own people to rescue those who are being taken away to death and holds them responsible and without excuse when they fail to do so (Prov 24:11-12) and  (7) WHEREAS God establishes all governing authorities as His avenging servants to carry out His wrath on the evildoer; and commands these authorities to judge justly neither showing partiality to the wicked nor using unequal standards which are abominations (Psa 82; Rom 13:4) and  (8) WHEREAS in 1973 the Supreme Court of the United States rendered an iniquitous decision on Roe v. Wade and in doing so deprived the innocent of their rights and usurped God who sovereignly ordained their authority (Isa 5:23; 10:1-2; Psa 2; Matt 22:21; John 19:11; Acts 4:19; 5:29 Rom 13:1) and  (9) WHEREAS in the Roe v. Wade decision the Supreme Court of the United States subverted the U.S. Constitution namely the Preamble as well as the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments without any legal authority (Article 6 Clause 2 Supremacy Clause) and  (10) WHEREAS governing authorities at every level have a duty before God to uphold justice asserting their God-ordained and constitutional authority to establish equal protection under the law for all born and preborn by intervening ignoring or nullifying iniquitous decisions when other authorities condone such injustices as the legal taking of innocent life (Daniel 3; 1 Kings 12; 2 Kings 11; Jeremiah 26:10-16; 36:9-31; 37:11- 21; 39:7-10) and  (11) WHEREAS over the past 48 years with 60+ million abortions traditional Pro-life laws though well intended have not established equal protection and justice for the preborn but on the contrary appallingly have established incremental regulatory guidelines for when where why and how to obtain legal abortion of innocent preborn children thereby legally sanctioning abortion and  (12) WHEREAS since 1980 the Southern Baptist Convention and the Arkansas Baptist State Convention have passed many resolutions reaffirming the importance of human life at all stages of development our repentance is still lacking as we consistently have stopped short of calling for the immediate abolition of abortion without exception or compromise and  (13) WHEREAS our confessional statement The Baptist Faith and Message according to Article XV affirms that children from the moment of conception are a blessing and heritage from the Lord; and further affirms that Southern Baptists are mandated by Scripture to speak on behalf of the unborn and contend for the sanctity of all human life from conception to natural death now be it therefore  (14) RESOLVED that the messengers of the Ouachita Baptist Association annual meeting on October 10th 2020 do state unequivocally that abortion is murder and we reject any position that allows for any exceptions to the legal protection of our preborn neighbors compromises Gods holy standard of justice or promotes any God-hating partiality (Psa 94:6; Isa 10:1-2; Prov 24:11; Psa 82:1-4) and be it further  (15) RESOLVED that we will not embrace an incremental approach to ending abortion because it challenges Gods Lordship over the heart and the conscience and rejects His call to repent of sin completely and immediately (Gen 3:1; John 8:44; Rom 2:14-15; 2 Corinthians 11:3) and be it further  (16) RESOLVED that we affirm that the murder of preborn children is a crime against humanity that must be punished equally under the law and be it further  (17) RESOLVED that we humbly confess and repent of our complicity in recognizing any exceptions that legitimize or regulate abortion and of our apathy in not laboring with the power and influence we have to abolish abortion and be it further  (18) RESOLVED that as churches of the Ouachita Baptist Convention we will engage with Gods help in establishing equal justice and protection for the preborn according to the authority of Gods Word as well as local and federal law and call upon pastors and entity leaders to use their God-given gifts of preaching teaching and leading with one unified principled prophetic voice to abolish abortion and be it finally  (19) RESOLVED that because abolishing abortion is a gospel issue we will call upon governing authorities at all levels to repent and obey everything that [Christ] has commanded exhorting them to bear fruit in keeping with repentance by faithfully executing their responsibilities as Gods servants of justice and working with all urgency to enact legislation using the full weight of their office to interpose on behalf of the preborn abolishing abortion immediately without exception or compromise (Mark 6:18; Matt 28:18-20; Rom 13:4 6,political,Facebook

"Abortion is neither healthcare or a right protected by the Idaho Constitution or the U.S. Constitution. To regulate abortion for exceptions such as rape or incest is to ignore truth and science that shows life begins at fertilization. I would not vote for any bill that regulates the murdering of my neighbors young or old period. To do so would be a violation of the constitutional conscience of the people and would teach the people that life is not sacred and that right and wrong is a slave to my feelings or circumstances.

KFL Reaffirms Position on Taxpayer Funded Abortions  For immediate release March 2 2020 Contact: Jeanne Gawdun KFL Director of Government Relations jeanne@kfl.org  Topeka--Kansans for Life is calling on all state legislators to approve the Value Them Both Amendment to the State Constitution especially before Medicaid Expansion advances. Recent court rulings have endangered almost every state regulation on abortion including a ban on taxpayer/Medicaid funded abortions.  The 2019 Hodes decision cleared a path toward Medicaid funded abortion said Jeanne Gawdun KFLs Director of Government Affairs. Expanding a program that will soon offer free taxpayer funded abortions is cruel and a non-starter. The only way to ensure Medicaid doesnt become a funding stream for the abortion industry is to pass the Value Them Both Amendment first.  To be clear a vote for Medicaid expansion before the passage of the Value Them Both Amendment is a vote for taxpayer funded abortion.  ###,political,Facebook
"The Holocaust also known as the Shoah was a genocide during World War II in which Nazi Germany aided by local collaborators systematically murdered some six million European Jewsaround two-thirds of the Jewish population of Europebetween 1941 and 1945.  This Pales In Comparison of the number of ""Abortions"" performed just in this Country since 1973 About (60-MILLION)  So is a fetus a human? Or is it something else? Biologically speaking human life begins at conception.  When the mothers egg and the fathers sperm come together they combine and create a new string of DNA that is personalized and totally unique. DNA is coded information the blueprint for the new humans growth and development.  No more genetic material needs to be added; the zygote in the womb is as (Human as the Mother in whose womb it dwells.)  The difference between a fetus and any one of us is one of age location and level of dependence. When a mother aborts the process of fetal development she is destroying a unique life.  The Bible considers a fetus to be an unborn child a planned human being that God is forming from the moment of conception.  This being the case it doesnt really matter what human jurisprudence says or how socially or politically acceptable abortion is. (Gods law takes precedence). A mother who decides to abort her child is unilaterally making a decision to end another persons lifeand that is and always has been the definition of murder.  Over half of premature babies born between 23 and 24 weeks of pregnancy will survive delivery and live to see life outside of the NICU. Babies born before 23 weeks may survive  the youngest preemie ever to survive was Amillia Taylor born at only 21 weeks and 6 days gestation.

Hot items: critical race theory; cancel culture; defund the police; Southern border crisis; wokism; socialism and Marxism; Green New Deal and climate change; big tech censorship and social media platforms; Wuhan lab leak CCP seeks to control America; and the Great Reset.  And a few recent headlines: Antifa BLM and White supremacists; suicide rate rises; 2020 election fraud; assault on Constitution and Bill of Rights; abortions cryptocurrencies LBGTQ; Biden and Harris Administration; Covid 19 vaccines and mandates; and the U.S. debt approaching $30 trillion.  Why all the liescorruptionlawlessnessself-interestpower struggleschasing the almighty dollarinjustice. Where are we heading as a nation? I am not an alarmistbut a realist. So lets look at Gods Word for an understanding.  May I be bold and bluntwhy this mess? Bottom lineit is Satan.  Lets reviewGod created Lucifera high and mighty angela cherubim. God created Lucifer and millions of angels prior to creating the earth. (Job 38:4-7) (Ezekiel 28:12-19)  Lucifer then sinned by attempting to become God and was filled with pride. (Isa 14:12-14 Ezekiel 28:15-17)  God pushed Lucifer and one-third of the angels from the Heaven of Heavens. (Luke 10:18 Revelation 12:49)  Lucifer became known as Satantempted Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. (Genesis 3:13)  Adam and Eve fell and sinned against Godas a result all mankind is born with a sin nature.  By the waySatan is alive and well today. Did you know that Satan still has restricted access to the heavenly realm? God has given Satan limited powers todayand it is temporary (Romans 16:20). 1 John 5:19 tells us that the whole world is under the control of the evil one the fallen angels and the demons.  Satan is gradually setting up a one world governmenthe has a controlled agenda. And most important to himhe is doing all he can to thwart Gods redemptive plan. And he is working overtime because he knows his time is short and coming to an end.  Lets now look at AmericaI believe we are a post Christian nation. We have thrown God out. Want proofhere is a partial list: remove prayer in public schools in 1962; remove Bible reading in public schools in 1963; abortion legalized in 1973; remove Ten Commandments from classroom in 1980; struck down sodomy law in 2003; ruled DOMA unconstitutional in 2013; and approved same sex marriages in 2015.  Satan has infiltrated the Halls of Congress The White House the Supreme Court schools and universities churches Hollywood the media and yesour homes.  Let me share some highlights of the Ninevah and Jerusalem principle written by Bill Salus in June 2016. This talks about Americas spiritual condition.  First the Ninevah experiencea story of hope found in Jeremiah 18:7-8 If at any time I announce that a nation or kingdom is to be uprooted torn down or destroyed and that nation I warned repents of its evil then I will relent and not inflict on it the disaster I had planned. God sent Jonah to warn the people of its impending destruction. The people of Ninevah turned from evil waysthe resultGod saw their works and relented from bringing disaster upon them (Jonah 3:410).  And the Jerusalem experiencea story of despair found in Jeremiah 18:9-10 And if at another time I announce that a nation or kingdom is to be built up or planted and if it does evil in my sight and does not obey me then I will reconsider the good I had intended to do for it. The nation of Judah reached a point of no return and the Lord determined that its destruction would not be postponed. In fact God told Jeremiah to stop praying for the people of Judah three times. The people of Judah forsook their God JehovahJeremiah 19:4-9 provides the indictment.  The Lord has provided ample warnings to America that the country is headed for destruction. When will God judge America? Is it happening now? What does your heart of hearts tell you?  Does America have a national repentance forthcoming? If yes America must resemble forgiven Ninevah. If no the Lord will no longer bless this nation and Americas greatness will never return. Only God knows Americas final verdict.  Lets turn our attention to mankind now. What about each of us as individualswe are born into sinwe each have a sinful nature within us.  What does the Bible say about mankind? Romans 3:10 says There is none righteous not even one. Romans 3:23 says All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.  Take this to the bankGod wants all mankind to be saved. Romans 10:13 says Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.  God has provided a means for salvationJesus died on the cross to pay for our sins. We must confess our sins and accept Jesus as Lord and Savior. Ephesians 2:8-9 says For it is by grace you have been saved through faithand this is not from yourselves it is the gift of Godnot by works so that no one can boast.  If you accept Jesus God then sends the Holy Spirit to live within your heart. Have you done that? You become a new personyou have the power of the Holy Spirit within you. By the way the Holy Spirit will communicate with your spirit and let you know you are saved. And this is very important to rememberSatan has no authority over those who are in Christ but has domain over unbelievers.  I have made a recent study and believe that less than ten percent of the worlds population including America will go to Heaven. In fact in a recent Barna poll it was found that only six percent of Christians hold to a biblical worldview.  Will there be a revival in America? My answer--I believe not prior to the seven-year Tribulation. During the Tribulation there will be one last huge revival with millions accepting Jesus refer to Revelation 6:9-11 and Revelation 20:4.  As we Christians wait patiently for the Rapture what are we to do today? We must share Christ with others churches must preach the Gospel and we must love one another as John 13:34 states A new command I give you love one another as I have loved you so you must love one another.  Very importantand dont forget--in the end God wins! Satan and all unbelievers will be thrown into the Lake of Fire for eternity.  Lets end by quoting John 3:16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. Is the Holy Spirit speaking to you? Please accept Jesus! Amen.,political,Facebook
A fantastic week in the House of Delegates!   The House unanimously approved House Bill 2368 known as Mylissa Smiths Law March 23. This bill was named in honor of a Kanawha County hospice nurse who contracted COVID. The measure would establish guidelines for the frequency of allowable visitation so patients could see family members clergy or hospice while complying with all applicable procedures already established by the health care entity.  Mylissa had a true nurses heart and caring for people in their final years through hospice was her passion said Delegate Dean Jeffries D-Kanawha and lead sponsor of the bill. This bill will never wipe clean the images of lipstick prints and tear stains left on the windows of our nursing homes nor will it return the lost days that should have been spent comforting loved ones. There are too many stories like Mylissas and too many of our frontline heroes have carried the burden of this pandemic day after day. I can only pray that going forward we have done all we can to ensure humanity is preserved for those in need in times such as these.   The House passed the 2nd Amendment Preservation Act which protects West Virginians and Law Enforcement from enforcing federal gun laws that arent encoded in state law. The bill passed 74-22.   House Bill 2630 which would require the West Virginia DEP to reimburse certain fines paid by towns villages and communities also passed the full House March 23. Its lead sponsor Delegate Charlie Reynolds R-Marshall said he hopes the bill can become law to support community improvements throughout the state.  Ive heard from so many of our small towns that they dont have the funds to correct some of the problems theyre getting fined for by the DEP and those bills just compound the problem Reynolds said. This is a way the DEP can still carry out its objectives while allowing our cash-strapped communities to actually fix some of their infrastructure issues.   The House completed the Second Chances at Life Act which would require a pregnant woman seeking a chemical abortion to be informed that it may be possible to stop the intended effects if the second pill has not been taken and she changes her mind but time is of the essence. The bill also would require the woman to be notified among other information already in code that the father if his identity can be determined is liable to assist in the support of the child including paying 50 percent of medical expenses that began at conception.   One of several bills from the House of Delegates meant to help our first responders military members and veterans is HB2874 which unanimously passed the House this week. This measure would add Active Military Members and their spouses to the successful Boots to Business program through the West Virginia Secretary of State. This would offer a waiver of initial business registration fees and certain annual business fees to active-duty military members their spouses and immediate family members when they start businesses in West Virginia. The state has a host of active-duty military members and this would help make West Virginia the easy choice for those families.  Military Spouses in particular are a group in our community that are often unemployed or underemployed due to the nature of their spouses service said Delegate Kayla Young D-Kanawha and lead sponsor of the bill. Its a great way to say thank you to those who protect us along with their families who make it possible.   The House completed the Anti-Discrimination against Israel Act HB2933 March 26. This would prohibit a public entity from entering a contract with a company without a written certification that the company is not currently engaged in and will not for the duration of the contract engage in a boycott of goods or services from Israel or territories under its control. The Act would not apply to contracts with a total potential value of less than $100000 or contractors with fewer than 10 employees.  Thirty other states have enacted similar legislation and its Lead Sponsor Kayla Kessinger R-Fayette said the bills sole purpose is to take a strong stance in saying West Virginia will not use taxpayer dollars to help fund efforts to delegitimize and eliminate our closest ally in the Middle East.  I introduced this legislation for the first time in 2018 after coming back from Israel. I had the opportunity to meet with members of their community and prior to going there I was completely ignorant of the Boycott Divest and Sanction (BDS) movement Kessinger said. But after hearing from so many of their business leaders it truly brought to light this problem even here in West Virginia where weve had millions of dollars in exports to Israel.  I understand that on its face it may not seem relevant to us in West Virginia but after my visit I understood just how important the existence and security and strength of Israel is to the protection of the United States and West Virginia. We share military intelligence on counterterrorism and technology when it comes to advancing the way we protect ourselves at home and abroad.   The House passed several small tax cuts including the domestic animal tax and the municipal amusement tax.   House Bill 2981 would require the Department of Veterans Affairs to develop a suicide prevention assistance program.   The House passed economic development tax credits for small businesses in the state of West Virginia.,political,Facebook
Are We as Bad as the Cons? Not Only No But Hell No!  It is an integral part of the Cons and Supremacists strategy to cast us just as bad or maybe worse than they are. Used by the Russians and most authoritarian groups and nations it is a way to keep a kind of moral high ground even when you are a low life. Its kind of Look at you! the infamous Whataboutthisism and the art of the self-serving lie and the reinforcing myth. We are the baby killers those seeking to take away their rights to be an anal sphincter taking the nation to socialism and whatever feces they can throw up on the wall in hopes it may stick. They march in lockstep turning on a dime when they need to change the attack or message as they call it. For us nothing is safe from their lies their attack because they cant tell us what they really want. They just need to wreck everything so that we are afraid and confused. The same strategy of every authoritarian takeover in history.  They the Cons (Authoritarian Conservatives using sociopathic tactics) and their allies the Supremacists (Oil Corporate White and Religious) look to create chaos in order to effect change control. They are banking on a deal with the devil virtual economic stability in return for no action against their takeover of the process of America. That was the deal. And now the devil wants what he thinks is his due  Everything I repeat everything the Cons and Supremacists have done is part of a larger scam. They use dishonesty of intent as a shield against the truth along with fear and greed. The righteous and white shall inherit the Earth as they see it. That there is only Gods Truth which is whatever scam will work today. They use abortion and killing babies as their reason for attacking us but then turn a blind eye to those same kids after they are born. As they see the creation of a destitute underclass as protection for their Success and wealth.  Once we understand that its all a well-orchestrated scam we can begin to counter them. What is happening is nothing less than a fight for the soul and survival of an America based in rule of law government for and by the people and that we are all equal. It is we that are on the side of the better angels as Lincoln put it. But they have pastor Bubba a huge propaganda machine and the power of their money. They are unbridled by truth logic or ethics. They are what we can be if we fail as human beings. Are we as bad as they are? Hell no! We are the hope of the future those that seek the truth logical ways of doing things and for laws to be ethical and just. It is time to celebrate who we are in the face of what they are doing and who they are. Foundation! RC Romine,political,Facebook
"Although this story was published by the (Babylon Bee a satirical evangelical Christian website.) A person could almost take it as the truth based on the actions of the Democrats. Part of my post covering fools & their lack of feeling for the life of a fetus/baby could certainly apply. THIS IS SATIRE AND TO MY KNOWLEDGE DID NOT REALLY HAPPEN.  BY THEIR OWN MOUTH'S - THE DEMOCRATS ADMIT THEY ARE ""GODLESS"" ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WASHINGTON D.C.Trying to get to the bottom of how and why President Trump was elected House Democrats issued a subpoena to the Almighty God to force Him to testify in Congress Wednesday.  While House leadership was quick to clarify that they (DON'T BELIEVE IN THE GOD OF THE BIBLE PER SE) they said they had to explore ""all possible avenues"" in their exhaustive search for an answer as to why Trump was put in the White House.  ""We're not sure if God is out there or if there's some great positive spiritual energy holding up the cosmos"" said Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. ""But whoever he or she or xe is we will interrogate them. We will not allow God to get off the hook for His collusion in bending all of human history to His irresistible will.""  After the Lord who sits in the heavens and does all He pleases did not show up at their hearing Democrats were seen eating KFC to mock Him for being ""a chicken"" and issued a stern warning.  ""These subpoenas are not optional"" said Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee Jerry Nadler. ""When the Congress of the United States commands you to appear you appear. I don't care if you are the Lord of all creation. Trump is in the White House and we will get answers."" ----------------------------------------------------------------- The Absurdity Of This Statement Is Beyond Belief  This without a doubt answers why the act of ""Abortion"" is no big deal to them. It also answers a lot about their ""IDEOLOGY""  A fool is often contrasted with the ways of the wise. In modern usage a fool can be a dupe an ignoramus or just a ridiculous person  There are many examples of a fool in the Book of Proverbs  Proverbs 10:14 states The mouth of a fool brings ruin near. This contrasts the speech of the fool with the knowledge of the wise. A fool does not care about learning. Hes too busy talking.  Proverbs 10:23 adds that doing wrong is like a joke to a fool. A foolish person does not take sin or its consequences seriously.  Proverbs 12:15 says The way of a fool is right in his own eyes but a wise man listens to advice. The fool rejects the advice of others and instead listens only to himself.  Proverbs 13:16 notes A fool flaunts his folly. In other words a foolish person is proud of his wrong actions.  (Often in Scripture a fool is associated with wickedness and a direct denial of God (e.g. in Psalm 53:1).  THERE IS NOW NO EXCUSE FOR HOW A TRUE BELIEVER SHOULD VOTE.

Today the voters in our district received a mailer from an outside special interest group which falsely claims that I'm a never Trumper. The mailer contains a Facebook quote that I made very early on in the 2016 Republican Primary. At the time I had concerns that President Trump wouldn't govern as a conservative if he were elected President. However despite my concerns I still voted for President Trump in the 2016 Presidential election against Hillary Clinton and I even attended a rally for him in Ohio in October of 2016. Since President Trump took office he's exceeded my expectations and clearly has governed as a conservative. He's cut taxes reduced regulations and appointed two great Supreme Court justices who were confirmed to the court. I fully support President Trump and his America First Agenda. I'm proud that I voted for him and I'll be proud to cast a vote for him in November.  This mailer runs counter to the claims made by my opponent and her supporters. They claim that I'm the only candidate in this race who's supported by outside groups. As this mailer makes abundantly clear that's completely untrue. My opponent has the support of outside groups that are attacking me.  I'm just as tired of these negative mailers as anyone else. I completely understand where people are coming from when they complain about these mailers. I promote positivity in my campaign and reject negativity. So far there haven't been any outside groups that have sent out mailers attacking my opponent. If they do going forward I'll make it clear to voters that I don't condone those types of mailers. I know that the voters of our district respond favorably to a candidate who runs a positive campaign and has a positive message.  Even though I believe in being positive I do believe that I have the right to defend myself when I get attacked. The individual who is responsible for running this false attack ad is a former state legislator. He's known as being one of the most liberal members of the legislature and he's also pro abortion. He was one of only four Republicans in the state legislature to vote against the Value Them Both pro life Constitutional amendment. This amendment would've overturned the Kansas Supreme Court's decision which created a Constitutional right to an abortion. This individual is falsely attacking me because he doesn't like my conservative pro life values. I don't believe the people of our district will stand for that.  Despite these false attacks I'm going to continue to promote positivity in my campaign. I've received a lot of compliments from people in our district regarding my positive approach to campaigning. I'm going to continue that positive issue based approach. I believe that the voters in our district want to know why they should vote for me rather than why they should vote against my opponent. I believe that the positive vision that I have for our state is resonating with the people of our district.  I would appreciate your vote on or before August 4th.,political,Facebook

Projection: Accuse your enemy of that which you yourself are guilty of. This is the method that the left has used for decades to fool Americans. The bought and paid for corrupt fake news main stream media or MSFM or main stream fake media or fake news helps them.! But people are becoming more educated and aware now of the lies and distortions perpetuated on them for years. All the people that were taken for granted by the democrats to vote and keep them in power are now exiting this party in masses. They realize that the democrats did not really care for the blacks or Latinos or civil rights. They just wanted their votes.They also don't give a damn about other minorities including jews and many other groups. they feel endangered with any black voice or Latino voice or any voice that they feel might not vote for them. They accomplished this by dividing these people against each other. Blacks against whites rich against poor pro abortion or choice versus pro life pro women versus anti women.(This last one is truly absurd as though some were born not by women. Some don't have mothers and sisters and daughters and grandmothers or aunts and hate all of them because they are women !!) It's so stupid and absurd that it is really laughable LOL !!!! If you are part of any group and you disagree with them you are attacked. You are the wicked and they are there to protect the poor the weak and the innocent.! Candace Owens who in my opinion is a brilliant young lady and a voice of reality and common sense but conservative is viciously attacked by all liberals white black jewish latino and every other liberal group.This holds true for all women and men and conservatives no matter race religion status origin or creed ! As long as you belong to the party you are wonderful brilliant and smart. You are just a vote to keep them in power. That is what you really are ! Those who have changed from a liberal ideology to a conservative one are attacked constantly.I feel sorry for them because when they encounter the intolerance and hate from the party they no longer support or switched from they are shocked because they are attacked more viciously. Another example (there are many ) is Brandon Straka a gay former liberal who encourages others to walk away from the Democrats.Read about him and others like him. !

A letter to the editor of the Pike County Courier:  VOICE FOR VOICELESS HUMAN BEINGS I was saddened to hear the governor of Virginia defend legislation that would not only allow abortion when a woman is in labor but also permit infanticide after the baby is born. The Va governor explained that the newborn would be kept comfortable. He then said that the infant would be resuscitated if thats what the mother wants. On the other hand the newly born infant presumably could be left to die if the mother so chooses. To add insult to injury the state of New York recently passed the Reproductive Health Act which permits abortion up until birth even when the mother is fully dilated. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo celebrated the new law by directing that One World Trade Center be lit in pink. America fits in to the same ranks as China and North Korea which also permit such atrocities against human life. Speaking on behalf of the millions of tiny and voiceless human beings who have no say in this matter it is now scientifically irrefutable that these laws promote and permit the taking of human life a life that is completely separate and distinct from that of the babys mother and father. A DNA PROFILE FOR THE UNBORN CHILD CAN NOW BE OBTAINED AS EARLY AS 8 WEEKS INTO THE PREGNANCY. Experts on human embryonic development have confirmed that unborn babies have the capacity to feel pain as early as 8 weeks. At the fetal age of 22 -24 week (beginning of the third trimester) the baby is viable outside of the womb with the assistance of medical technology. This unique little human being will even have its own completely formed fingerprints by the time it is 6 months old in utero or 3 months before the baby is born. I think it is an abomination that in the United States of America we place more value on the unborn life of a marine turtle than on the unborn life of a human. Florida state law provides protection against taking possessing disturbing mutilating destroying selling offering for sale transferring molesting or harassing any marine turtle its nest or eggs. Federal law provides even greater protection and criminal penalties as severe as $100000 and a year in prison. Yet some states now permit the taking disturbing and destruction of the life of a fully developed third trimester baby during an abortion procedure and some abortion facilities preserve those parts of the fetus that are human organs which can be offered for sale and transferred from the abortion clinic to a research lab. These babies can yawn suck their thumbs kick hiccup and feel the pain of the sharp instruments used to abort them. Yet they have no say in the matter. I hope and pray that America wakes up and speaks up in support of legislation that will give these babies the same legal protections that have been afforded to sea turtles.,political,Facebook

Today is a dark dark day in America and we will look back on this day in horror.  Today the United States Senate failed to gather enough votes to move the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act through a procedural vote and on to the floor. What does that mean? It means that when faced with a choice - deliver life-saving medicine to infants who survive failed abortions and are born alive - the United States Senate failed to defend those newborns.  Senate Democrats made it clear to the nation - and the world - that in today's America the Democratic Party is the Party of Death.  All 6 Democratic senators running for president in 2020 - every single one of them - voted against legislation that simply requires physicians to deliver care to any infant that survives an attempted abortion and is delivered alive.  Elizabeth Warren.  Kamala Harris.  Bernie Sanders.  Cory Booker.  Kirsten Gillibrand.  Amy Klobuchar.  Again - all this legislation requires is delivering medical treatment to a living breathing newborn baby in America.  In 2019 in the middle of all the marvels of modern medicine that have average life expectancies soaring and life-threatening diseases declining it is perfectly acceptable in the eyes of the Democratic Party to watch newborn babies die on the table.  Disgusted is an understatement. There are no words to describe this horror.  Only 3 Democrats - THREE - found the moral strength to break with their despicable party and vote with Republicans in support of life.  Today we are calling on all pro-life Americans to join with Restoration PAC and make it clear that we will not let these abhorrent politicians ever forget the horrible choice they made today. Many of them are up for re-election in 2020 and we will do everything we can to make sure that 2020 is the year they lose.

"To answer some questions received in PM I will also answer publicly.  Q: Voter ID A: I support voter ID 100 percent.  Q: Puberty blocking medications and/or medication introduced to children to promote sex change. A: I do not believe a parent should be able to force these medications on a child. A child is not mentally developed enough to understand consequences of said medications which include a high risk of suicide. These medications should be reserved for individuals having reached an appropriate age who can decide for themselves as well as form a mature understanding of these medications.  Q: Taxes A: #TAXATIONISTHEFT It is my stance that no more tax burdens be added to our citizens. I understand that a state needs revenue to run and to help its citizens. I also believe that payroll taxes are not necessary as proven by other states.  Q: Education A: I am married to a teacher and understand the frustrations on both sides as a parent and a teacher. We should be getting feedback from our teachers to see what exactly is working and what is not.  Q: Marriage A: We should not be asking the State's Permission to enter into a Civil Union.  Q: Veterans A: I am a disabled veteran. I will do anything I can to help all veterans.  Q: Guns A: BUY all you want and carry daily. I'll join you. Now I agree with FREE background checks. Some citizens have had their rights stripped by due process.  Q: Gun Shows A: YES I agree that we should close the ""no background check"" loophole. I believe that is responsible and reasonable.  Q: Abortions A: My stance is clear. No. I believe we need to put Abortion as a ballot measure to strengthen further legislation.  Q: Justice Reform A: The first step do away with private for profit prisons who make money from taxpayers and get paid even when beds are empty. These contracts have a minimum occupancy rate which means that we MUST imprison citizens to keep them happy.  Q: Marijuana A: We need to decriminalize minor possession. We need to expand our industry and catch up with other states.  Q: Term limits A: I want a two term limit and I will only serve two terms if I am elected to two terms. After that it is time for fresh eyes and fresh perspectives.  I hope this answers a few questions for everyone.  Neil",political,Facebook

One ad cited today's disproportionately high abortion rate in the black community and said (Killing black babies is no way to fight poverty). The Republican Party could care less about how many black babies die today or tomorrow and their voting record proves it. That should be our measuring stick. How they vote and what impact that vote has on the black community. But that particular ad really grabbed me. (Killing black babies is no way to fight poverty). The racist drug laws have one purpose especially the way it's prosecuted. To eliminate the young black men from society so they won't have babies. It's no accident that blacks make up 12 percent of the population but fill the nation's jails and prisons. Its no accident the per capita incarceration rate among blacks is seven times higher than whites. And it's certainly no accident in Washington DC nearly 50 percent of young black men between the ages of 18 and 35 are under criminal justice supervision because that's where it's all coming from. So who's making all the black babies that America's PAC is supposedly so concerned about? (Read Between The Lies). Professors David Baldus George Woodworth and Charles Pulaski did an exhaustive study on the justice system and evidence regarding disparities in treatment among the races in 1970. They concluded mush of the disparity seemed attributable to the prosecutors. This was in McCleskey v Kemp 481 U.S. 279 (1987). How did the cowardly lions of the Supreme Court handle this? (l) They precluded McCleskey from discovering evidence of intent from the two parties whose discriminatory intent he was required to establish. (2) Absent a confession from the judge prosecutor or a juror that they acted because of racial bias the McClesky standard cannot be met. So far it never has been. The Baldus study demonstrated a ""constitutionally unacceptable risk"" of discriminatory results. The McClesky majority however found the risk"" constitutionally acceptable"". It's rational: discrimination is inevitable; it's a by-product of discretion. What a pitiful pathetic statement from the cowardly loins on the Supreme Court. In his book No Equal Justice David Cole may have explained it best when he stated... Although the approach in McClesky maybe understandable it is still problematic. First it abandons perhaps the judiciary's most important role in a constitutional democracy protecting interest otherwise unprotected in the political process. As Professor John Hart Ely has argued the Court an undemocratic institution in the heart of a democracy is at its most legitimate where it counteracts defects in the majoritarian process. One such defect and the reason for the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment is that majorities tend to trample on the rights of disfavored minorities. In the United States African Americans are the paradigmatic disfavored minority group. Knowing and admitting this as fact the cowardly lions on the Supreme Court still gave unfettered discretion to racist prosecutors to prosecute their fake war on drugs. They call it The Crack Law when in fact it should be called The Black Law. Why? Because of prosecutorial discretion they only prosecute black defendants. The U.S. Sentencing Comminission found that 65 percent of crack users are white. Yet 90 percent of federal crack cocaine defendants are black. The Commission also found in an astonishing three year period not a single white had been prosecuted on a federal crack cocaine charge in seventeen states. The logical inference to be drawn is that prosecutors in federal courts are selectively prosecuting black defendants who were involved in crack no matter how trivial the amount and ignoring or diverting whites when they do the same thing. In 1995 the U.S. Sentencing Commission concluded that the disparities could not be justified by qualitative between the two drugs and recommended its change. For the first time in its history since the sentencing guidelines were created in 1984 Congress passed a law overriding a Sentencing Commission recommendation to alter the . guidelines. (Another Black Law Created). Why? To be seen as tough on crime which is the buzz-word for keep Black America under lock and key by any means necessary. When courage's judges like Judge Cahill in the E.D. Missouri spoke out in U.S. v Clary 846 F.Supp. 768 ... There are many prisoners serving 10 year sentences for possessing with intent to distribute 50 grams of crack. They are usually between the ages of 18 and 30  and 90 percent of them are black. Their absence in such numbers if continued threatens the possibility of the ultimate extinction of the black race in America. (So where are all the black babies Mr. Nadler and his America's PAC are so concerned about?) Judge Cahill went on to say ... as sad as it may sound and as mush as the Court feels discomfort in pointing it out if young white males were being incarcerated at the same rate as young black males the statute would have been amended long ago (ID at 792). Judge Cahill was not just capriciously making a statement. He simply used the U.S. history of drug law changes when those laws started to effectively incarcerate the white majority. Marijuana is a prime example. America's first users were Mexicans it spread to jazz musicians and those America classified as lower class. Nobody cared when it was perceived: as a ghetto problem. The federal penalties for the sale and possession of marijuana in 1956 ranged from two to five years imprisonment; a second offense five to ten years; and a third brought ten to twenty years. Nobody cared how many Mexicans and Blacks got a twenty year sentence for a third possession of just one joint. But in the 1960's and 70's when nice little middle class white girls and boys in college started to get busted for the exact same thing and the punitive and vindictive approach was touching all classes of society. Then and only then were the harsh penalties imposed when their effect was primarily felt by minorities were no longer acceptable. Police and prosecutors were under orders to leave users alone. Simple possession of less than one ounce was classified as a misdemeanor in all but eight states by the end of 1972. Oregon went further and actually decriminalized possession of small amounts and by 1981 ten other states followed suit. (White Law) LSD the most dangerous hallucinogen to ever hit the market. Young mostly white men and women were jumping off rooftops murdering their parents and siblings in their sleep. Some went on high trips and never came back to reality. Yet the Sentencing Commission modified the LSD sentence to not include the paper weight. In their own words (the Commission has determined that basing offense levels on the entire weight of the LSD carrier medium would produce unwarranted disparity). Which was a way for the Commission to reduce the LSD sentence and they made the change Retroactive. (White Law) Methamphetamine a drug mostly associated with Caucasians. What happened when whites started going to jail in record numbers because ofMeth? The Sentencing Commission directed the Courts to exclude the weight of the waste water used to manufacture the Meth thus reducing the sentence for Meth and made the change retroactive. (White Law). By contras let's see how the Sentencing Commission dealt with the Heroin Law mostly associated with black defendants. 2. D.I. A. Unless otherwise specified (meaning drugs used by whites are excluded from this law) the weight of a controlled substance set forth in the drug table refers to the entire weight of any mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of the controlled substance. 2. D.1.1 Application Notes (1) ... in part if such material cannot readily be separated from the mixture or substance that appropriately is counted in the drug quantity table. Meaning if a black defendant has one ounce of heroin and it's mixed with 2 pounds of confectioner sugar even if the police put the mixture together that defendant can rightfully be charged and sentences for 2 pounds and one ounce heroin. (Black Law). By contrast Oxycodone. A dangerous opiate in the heroin family in pill form in prescription painkillers. This drug exploded into the mainstream of America. Young Caucasians were being arrested and were overdosing in record numbers. How did the Legislators and the Sentencing Commission deal with this dangerous emerging threat? They changed the method of weighing Oxycodone They instructed the sentencing court to break the pill open take out just the oxycodone and throw the rest away and made the change retroactive. Thus reducing the sentence for Oxycodone offenses. (White Law). Racist U.S. Attorneys hide their racism behind prosecutorial discretion. And judicial cowards trample the constitution to allow this unconscionable behavior but only when it involves Black Americans. It brings to mind the Supreme Court's Dred Scott decision principle. A black man has no rights that a white racist prosecutor has to honor. So if you're familiar with Mr. Nadler and his America's PAC. Tell him to spend 3 million dollars on the issue of prosecutorial prejudice. And we'll take care of our own black babies. In the mean time we will continue to (Read Between The Lies).

Subterfuge and Candor - Charlie's Soapbox 6/21/19  When I hear people say that Obama is responsible for the good economy we are experiencing it reminds me of a statement Obama made about manufacturing jobs in America.  He said some of those jobs of the past are just not gonna come back and questioned Donald Trumps ability to do what he was promising to bring back manufacturing jobs he even went on to mockingly ask What magic wand do you have?  And statements about the new reality a scenario where America must accept a reduction in lifestyle a downgrading of our economy and acceptance of our industry moving out of the country taking good paying jobs with them to nations with much lower pay scales where they manufacture products and sell them in the USA without penalty.  I dont think Barack Obama really wanted to see America be all it could be I believe Obama saw America as a bully as an expansionist nation forcing our will on the world at large a repressive tyrant that needed to be brought down a notch or two and take its place in the New World Order a placating passive nation of repentant supplicants forever apologizing for our greatness and paring it down by sharing it with the world.  I think the statements Obama made to describe those he so disagreed with and feared was the one about people clinging to their guns or religion and America is no longer a Christian nation most clearly define the disparity of his ideas about America.  Most all the people I associate with believe in Almighty God own guns that they will never give up without a fight and I dont know where President Obama got his stats but America is still by and large a Christian country.  I think what he meant was that the people who clung to their God and guns and practiced Christianity were standing in the way of the kind of future he envisioned for America where the government controlled everything setting itself up as some kind of pseudo-deity.  Christians will never accept government as their god and people with guns are willing to protect their stand against any government who would infringe on their beliefs.  Obamas third term insofar as intent and policy was to be carried on by Hillary Clinton.  Along comes Donald Trump a New York real estate developer and former television star brash abrasive pugnacious plain-spoken afraid of no one who could trade punches with any politician or pundit willing to stand toe to toe with any detractor and insist that his concept of America was totally different from Obama Clinton et al.  He believed - and made the disenfranchised believe - that those jobs Obama declared gone forever could come back that America could drill frack and pump our way out of the clutches of oil producing countries in the Middle East who hate our guts.  He believed in the sanctity of life and stood against the wholesale abortion policies of Obama.  He was pro-gun pro-Israel embraced Christianity and told us that with the easing of regulations and some sane tax policy that the manufacturing jobs we had lost or basically given away under Obama could be brought back on shore.  He told us that NAFTA was a bad deal for us and should be either renegotiated or abolished he told us that China had for decades taken advantage of our lax trade policies and should be made to toe the line with tariffs if necessary.  He told us he wanted to Make America Great Again and that GDP numbers in the 2% range were totally unacceptable.  He told us we needed a wall to help stem the overwhelming flow of people and drugs across our borders.  He told us he would appoint Supreme Court judges who would level the playing field against the liberal onslaught of the Obama appointees.  And despite the biggest and most concentrated all-out war by Democrats media and even some establishment members of his own party using government agencies false FISA court warrants a US Senator who has turned his whole tenure into trying to impeach him he has been able to deliver on most of what he promised.  At present we have twenty-four Democrat candidates vying for their partys nomination for president as far as I can see there is only one plank in the Democrat platform and that is to get rid of Trump.  So for a minute lets say they did get rid of Trump what would they do? Where would they take the country  All we have so far is that they would repeal most of what Trump has done which would mean higher taxes bigger government repressive regulations and all the other suffocating crap liberals can come up with.  So what would happen to the stock market?  What happens to manufacturing?  What happens to trade policies with China and the rest of the world?  What happens to the military buildup Trump initiated? Liberals and the military are like oil and water.  What happens with the Democrats open border policies when the entitlement rolls - and most of the Democrat candidates think the undocumented should be on them - what happens when they reach critical mass?  Of course what Ive addressed here is but the tip of a very large and very volatile iceberg.  And in November of next year we will learn if this iceberg will be pushed back out to sea or allowed to stay in port and cause a flood of unmanageable proportions.  What do you think?

Thank you Governor for your Pro Life stance!  RELEASE Thursday July 29 2021 Governor Ivey Joins Governor McMaster in Effort to Restore States Authority to Protect Lives of Unborn Children  MONTGOMERY  Governor Kay Ivey has signed on to an amicus brief led by South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster urging the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade and restore the authority of states to protect the lives of unborn children.  Governor McMaster today filed an amicus brief joined by Governor Ivey and 10 other governors in Dobbs v. Jackson Womens Health Organization urging the Supreme Court to reconsider and correct its previous decisions in Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood of Southeast Pennsylvania v. Casey.  Alabama will continue to fight for life so that every unborn child is protected. We must stand strong for those babies who do not have a voice and I assure my fellow Alabamians that we will continue this fight until they are protected once and for all said Governor Ivey. We will not rest until Roe v. Wade is overturned.  The following governors joined Governor McMasters brief along with Governor Ivey: Governor Douglas A. Ducey of Arizona Governor Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida Governor Brian K. Kemp of Georgia Governor Brad Little of Idaho Governor Kim Reynolds of Iowa Governor Michael L. Parson of Missouri Governor Greg Gianforte of Montana Governor J. Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma and Governor Greg Abbott of Texas.  Background:  In 2018 Mississippis only abortion clinic Jackson Womens Health Organization and its medical director filed a lawsuit against Mississippis state health officer and others challenging the legality of the states recently enacted Gestational Age Act which prohibits abortion after 15 weeks gestation with exceptions for medical emergency or severe fetal abnormality. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi entered a temporary restraining order blocking the Act and later granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and permanently enjoined the Act. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the district courts ruling reasoning that in light of the Supreme Courts decision in Casey no state interest can justify a pre-viability abortion ban that 15 weeks gestation is before viability and that by prohibiting abortion after 15 weeks gestation the Act undisputedly prevents the abortions of some non-viable fetuses. The Fifth Circuit rejected Mississippis argument that the district court should have weighed the states interests in assessing the Acts validity concluding instead that because the Act is a prohibition on pre-viability abortion it is unconstitutional under Supreme Court precedent. Judge Ho who concurred in the Fifth Circuits judgment noted that although [n]othing in the text or original understanding of the Constitution establishes a right to an abortion he believed that [a] good faith reading of Supreme Court precedent required affirming the district courts decision. On May 17 2021 the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear Mississippis appeal and consider the following question: Whether all pre-viability prohibitions on elective abortions are unconstitutional.  The Supreme Court is expected to hear oral arguments in Dobbs this fall and issue a decision in the case by next spring or early summer.,political,Facebook
"Selected iVoter Questions and Answers from Jeff Scott  When you consider your views on a wide range of issues from economic and social matters to foreign policy and immigration which of the following [on a scale from Very Conservative to Very Liberal] best describes you overall?  As a Libertarian I don't fit into this right-left one-dimensional scale. I'm neither left nor right. On fiscal matters I agree with many conservatives who don't want high taxes or to burden our children with increasing national debt. On social matters I agree with many traditional liberals who don't want to be told how to live their lives. Both the Democratic and Republican Parties have shown time and again that they are incapable of resisting the temptation to use government power to force others to do as they wish. They enjoy putting the boot of power on the neck of the people especially in the name of national security. They invade privacy stamp out free speech hassle peaceful cannabis users inflate the fear of foreigners restrict trade.  What should the United States do to help eradicate the threat of radical Islamic terrorism?  To eradicate the threat the US should end its war. The job of our military is to protect American lives. When we use destructive force with no clear reason we kill innocent civilians. American interventionism abroad leads to blowback. Real conservatives know that Americans can't search for monsters abroad and maintain tranquility at home. I support reductions in military spending and foreign aid to warring nations. I support limits on NATO expansion and reducing its role in regime change. I oppose war on Iran a country that does not threaten us. Our relation with Russia a nuclear power is at an all time low. I encourage the president to remove aggressive American financial sanctions on both Iran and Russia. We must restore international civility and diplomacy. Americans polled now say 2-to-1 that we should NOT have gone to war in Iraq and Afghanistan. We are war weary. Time to let third parties take their peace platforms to D.C.  How would you promote healthcare coverage that is adequate affordable and accessible for all?  I support repealing ACA. Third-party payer systems that 'cover all medical needs' are flawed since they mix spending on routine predictable events with unpredictable emergency costs. Buyers of medical care under ACA are trapped. If they stop paying high premiums they risk medical and financial catastrophe. As consumers plan or no plan they are threatened with absurd and opaque prices. Medical costs will continue to spiral out of control until customers pry out and drive down the prices of services. The problem of fake inflated prices that appear on medical bills will not be solved under the flawed Medicare4All either. Further I support competition in professional labor. We should break the medical cartel that keeps service costs high because Americans should be able to choose the doctors they want and the care they need. I also favor doing away with the patent system for drugs an unnecessary government-granted monopoly that abuses people in need of care and fattens Big Pharma.  Under what circumstances should abortion be allowed?  I agree with the Supreme Court when it says that women should be free to choose prior to viability and that States are within their rights to restrict abortion after viability. I also believe exceptions need to be in place for cases of rape incest or if the life of the mother is endangered. I support the Casey decision (in Planned Parenthood vs Casey). I strongly object to Republicans who charge other parties of supporting ""infanticide"". They stoop low to rally their sensitive voters who don't have time to research the facts. In reality no one supports ""infanticide"" the killing of a live healthy breathing baby. I object strongly to the exploitation of this issue as a ""get out the vote"" tactic. The bullying candidates of the far right alone are responsible. Campaigns should not descend into shameless fear-mongering and incivility.  What role should government play in boosting the economy?  In Congress I would oppose all stimulus spending. I will work for fairness in business competition and against the Federal government's insider game of picking winners and losers. Further I would require that all emergency measures taken for the sake of stimulating the economy or protecting national security track the benefits to insiders. I oppose hidden taxpayer liabilities that sneak into bills and increase our long-term debt burden. I support low corporate taxes across the board and leaving private savings to the private sector to promote economic growth. Our national security state is also picking winners and losers in worldwide economic competition. We will be net exporter of oil in 2020. There is no reason for further oil wars. I oppose the use of war sanctions in peacetime. I support limiting the military's adverse effects on the world economy. I want to stop its destruction of lives property and the environment. War should be bad for business not good for business.  What changes should be made to the tax code?  Many libertarians believe that taxation is theft. The income tax is worse than theft since it is a tool of political power that targets individuals and movements. Financial surveillance on this scale has no place in a free society. I support abolition of the income tax. I view other taxes as fees charged for services. People should object to taxes and fees when the service is poor and the cost is high. Businesses that rip people off like that would not survive. To reduce spending and the size of government we have to return many government services to private hands. There is no better means of cost control than for consumers to demand better services from private managers not public administrators. Most government enterprises can't match the competitive private sector for quality. My written proposals for privatizing Veterans health care and the student lending system is the best way to reform those two poor-performing agencies.  What is the best way to bring down unemployment?  I oppose direct interference in the job market by the Federal government. Republicans complained that the Obama administration spent nearly a million dollars for every $50000 annual salary job he created or preserved. Who knows how much Trump is spending per job to boost his employment numbers? Republicans won't say but it's probably higher than what Obama spent. The Feds cannot pick winners and losers in business or labor. Favoring one group of job holders hurts another. Private capital builds job markets. I will fight to end manipulation of savings rates to very low levels enabling the government to borrow more that it ever could if it faced real market rates. A low or negative interest rate policy will destroy private savings. We should increase not decrease incentives for savers to accumulate real savings for their businesses and retirement. We cannot burden future generations with unmanageable debt. I strongly support automatic fiscal constraints when budgets are not balanced.  How would you guarantee Social Security benefits for future generations?  Social Security has been so poorly managed by Congress that it won't be financially viable by the time our youngest workers are ready for retirement. Our options are limited to raising contributions from taxpayers borrowing money or lowering benefits. I oppose higher taxes further indebtedness and undue burdens on young workers. As a financial professional I have a duty to protect the elderly who have already paid into the system. The benefit formula must reflect the reality that we are living and working longer. We can improve our prospects by allowing more immigration and getting life-extending treatments to market faster. With more young people longer work lives good economic growth adjustments to the benefit formula and market-based interest rates we can have a sustainable system. If Congress doesn't improve its own ability to cooperate the program will ultimately fail.  Is there anything else you would like voters to know about you?  The two major party candidates have both failed in this special election cycle to sit before an adversarial audience and take questions. Both take big money from out of state donors who expect favors in return. My campaign receives small individual donations and we have no corporate sponsors. The bitter partisan fighting we hear everyday drowns out calm consideration of the issues. We can't let bullying political parties bury the truth about what everyday Americans need from their lawmakers. As a Libertarian I will stand outside the swamp to bring professionalism and sanity the U.S. House of Representatives on behalf of the people of North Carolina. You have a rare opportunity support a moderate independent even-tempered candidate for this office. I ask for your vote on September 10.",political,Facebook

To answer a few questions openly not that I care to answer all the messages I am getting and I am answering them all as quickly as possible.  1. I am 200% Pro 2nd Amendment. I want Constitutional Carry to passed with an option to apply for a CCW so you may carry in other states.  2. Abortions- I am morally and ethically against abortion. With that until SCOTUS changes ROE v WADE there is absolutely nothing any politician can promise you to change the State Laws. If my Constituents want me to vote against or for it I am just the conduit to vote and my personal opinion should not sway my vote.  3. Taxes well they are theft. Whatever I can do to lessen a tax burden then I will be doing it. But how many politicians run on lower taxes?  4. Technology- Georgia needs to up the game here and make sure rural areas are covered. We could be doing so much during this shelter in place with education if we could get equal technology availability out there.  5. Department of Children and Family Services- I want this department dismantled and rebuilt from the ground up with a purpose that Children are the priority and before Children are removed a hearing needs to happen UNLESS an immediate and life threatening danger exist. Also DFCS employees need removed from the states protection list protecting them from lawsuits and legal charges when they violate the laws of Georgia.  These are a few questions I keep getting and I hope this helps more people.  We do not need another person who has been in politics all their life we need someone who stand up for you the citizens who put them there.,political,Facebook
Coronavirus is real. My mother succumbed to it yesterday. She was in the risk group she was 88 years old with Alzheimers living in a nursing home in NYC. She wanted a better life for us. I know she would not want to see society and the lives of her children and grandchildren destroyed because of the virus. How long can we be on lockdown?  It seems the virus is being used to accomplish the far left progressive agenda. People are dependent on government for money Freedom of movement and assembly are restricted Guns shops are being closed Churches are being closed No political rallies Trillions in government spending Speaking against the over response is mocked and silenced People kept apart from each other People controlled by fear Prisoners being let out of jail Law breaking has no punishment People are kept off the streets Unemployment up Jobs down Economy crashing President cant claim how good things are anymore Mockery of Make America Great Again We must follow the experts  Things like this dont just happen. However it came about the virus is being used to control us and take away our civil liberties.  Andrew Cuomo celebrates passing late term abortion but says every life must be protected from covid-19. I am pro-life. The left claims women have the right to abort a child but we dont have the right to leave our homes or interact because we may get sick? They can end a life but we cant make choices about our own? They tried to sneak Planned Parenthood funding into the bill. Bizarre on one hand they want to preserve life on the other they want to take it. If life is so precious that we must shut down society to preserve it why doesnt that apply to the unborn?  There have been 16 deaths in Arizona a state of 7.4 million people.  So many have died protecting freedom at Normandy Gettysburg and countless other battles in American history. We have been willing to die for our freedom but now we have been cowed into submission by a virus that the vast majority will have little or no symptoms. Plus they are repressing the actual positive results of hydroxychloroquine and Zithromax because they want the hysteria to continue. Everything they couldnt accomplish through the Russia and Impeachment hoaxs they are accomplishing through the virus. And I say this as someone who lost a parent due to the virus. The older we get the more at risk we are to illness and the closer we are to death these are facts that no politician can change.

I have close friends who have had an abortion. Women who I love and adore. Women who have grieved over the choice they made and mourned over the hopelessness they felt and the child that could have been.  I also have friends who have had an abortion and do not grieve. Women who I love and adore. Women who felt they had no choice and don't see their decision as a mistake but a necessity.  I have friends who are passionately against abortion and would do anything in their power to save an innocent child's life from being snuffed out before he or she had the chance to come into the world.  I have friends who believe it would be better for a child to not be born than to be born into a family of drugs alcohol and abuse.  I have friends who would say it is not our job to play God and it would be better for a child to be born and given a chance at life than to remove that chance altogether.  I am one who believes in the deepest parts of my soul that adoption is a beautiful picture of redemption and hope. I believe the foster care system needs dramatic overhauls and desperately needs to be fixed. I believe families are broken and until we heal families vicious cycles will continue. I believe the true losers in the abortion debate are the children.  When my adopted kids hear the argument that it would be better for a child to be aborted than to be born into a horrible situation they hear they were not worth being given a chance. They hear they are not valued. They hear they are a burden on society and that their lives were not worth saving.  Regardless of whether any of that is true it is what they hear.  I believe we can be passionately pro-choice or passionately pro-life and still share a meal together. We can still love and respect each other. What my kids need to see more than anything is that as adults we can have opposite perspectives and certainly different life experiences and we can find those things we love about each other instead of fixating on the things that separate us.  Regardless of where we are in the abortion debate for the sake of my children and others who are still in the foster care system or adopted lets remember that the person on the other side of the computer screen is but a flawed human like ourselves.  We will get nowhere if we dig our heels in and refuse to have productive conversations that offer solutions instead of screaming out our position from a megaphone.  My hearts desire would be to see fewer abortions healed families and a world where we can engage in thoughtful dialogue and civil discourse. Lets start there and work our way backwards. I think our world would be a better place if we use that as our starting point.,political,Facebook
Alabama Passes the Most Restrictive Bill in the United States  Yesterday the State of Alabama passed the strictest abortion law in our country which only allows for abortions when the life of the mother is in jeopardy. It doesnt even allow abortions in cases of rape or incest. Its almost criminal to think that a victim of rape or incest would be forced to have a child who was conceived under such circumstances that they would be responsible for the rest of their life. The stated purpose of this bill by many in the Republican-controlled legislature was to have the law ultimately end up before the United States Supreme Court where many believe that the current court would retreat from the protections provided to women under the historic Roe v. Wade Supreme Court Decision which established the right of women in all 50 states to obtain abortions under conditions prescribed by the court. It is anticipated that Alabamas Governor Kay Ivey a female will sign this bill into law. I hope and trust that our US Supreme Court will respect the judicial precedent established in Roe v. Wade when it ultimately reviews this law in the years to come.,political,Facebook
Press release: Recent protests in Frankfort Ky of Governor Andy Beshears actions to protect the Commonwealth  On 15 April 2020 a group of nearly 100 people descended on the Capitol grounds to protest actions taken by Governor Beshear which they believe have been to their detriment. These people felt so strongly that they broke social distancing guidelines and quite literally endangered their own lives and the lives of those around them in order to have their voices heard. Taken at face value one can empathize with that sentiment. Honestly I cant think of anything more aligned with American values than peaceful protest and civil disobedience towards systems of oppression. I need to be clear and say that my heart goes out to everyone- in Kentucky and otherwise- that is struggling due to the impacts of the CoronaVirus. I am one of those individuals. As a business owner I have seen a significant reduction in my bottom-line and as a candidate for Mayor of Frankfort it has become harder and harder to raise money for my political campaign. I get it. I really do. But my understanding only goes so far as those actions dont present a legitimate tangible danger to my community and the lives of those I care about. In this case that danger was real and no matter the legitimacy of the protestors intentions their actions yesterday were reprehensible and unjustified. Im proud of the seriousness the Frankfort community has given to our individual roles in combating this virus that has so drastically altered our lives. Because of each of our personal sacrifices the virus has for the most part spared Frankfort and Franklin County. Sadly I fear that the protests may have just undone a significant part of the work weve put in as a community. We understand our role as the Capital City and we understand that every problem that exists somewhere in Kentucky will eventually make its way here. We are the center of debate and civil discourse in the Commonwealth and as such it is incumbent upon us to provide an example of leadership in times of uncertainty. To his credit I believe Governor Beshear has handled this crisis as best as is possible. We are not Democrats or Republicans right now. We are united in the fight against a global pandemic and our leaders need to make the right choice not the popular choice. Let me be clear: the motives of at least a portion of that protest was disingenuous at best and nefariously coordinated at worst. Its no coincidence that their chants eventually moved toward abortion. Its no coincidence that the leader of that group is the same person that accused Governor Beshear of election fraud following the 2019 election. Its no coincidence that businesses associated with the protestors Facebook page have since distanced themselves from some of the more radical forces within the protest group. The aim of that group was nothing more than division and to discredit the good work that the Beshear administration has done in dealing with the CoronaVirus. That is not leadership and it has no place in our community. Our city our commonwealth and our nation are worth fighting for and we are stronger than these events. However the responsibility falls on all of us to fight against taking the easy path of pointing fingers and passing the buck. This is the leadership that I bring to my professional life a lifetime of volunteer service and with your help I will take this to the Mayors office come November. Were going to get through this together.   Jason Keller Candidate for Mayor Of Frankfort KY Owner of Keller Strategies For Appalachia,political,Facebook

BREAKING NEWS: A few moments ago the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals granted a writ of mandamus directing the district court to vacate its Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) of March 30 2020 which was issued by Judge Lee Yeakel in Austin to prevent the enforcement of Governor Greg Abbott's Executive Order GA 09 which delays elective medical surgeries and procedures including abortions until April 21. This means that elective abortions in Texas must be delayed just like other non-life saving surgeries and procedures during the current COVID-19 pandemic.  We are very pleased by the result. Clearly the crisis in Texas and across the nation calls for measures to conserve personal equipment needed to protect doctors and nurses fighting the coronavirus on the front lines. We believe that merely delaying abortion procedures a few weeks is reasonable and necessary.,political,Facebook
If you believe life begins at conception you must *act* on that belief and push for the abolition of abortion. Otherwise you merely have a moral opinion.  If you believe that life begins at conception and refuse to turn that moral opinion into an action you're intellectually inconsistent morally compromised and are prolonging the abolition of abortion by your inaction.  #AbolishAbortionVA,political,Facebook

"Personally I don't like to get too preachy. I want to stay in the middle. After the impeachment trial ended - we immediately had a coronavirus pandemic panic - and now we are morphing - into a debate on abortion - at the Supreme Court level - so it's -- a busy month. ""  Projecting Confidence -- Bring People Closer"" just got - a hell of a lot more difficult.   One of the things that I recently learned.. I'm going to share with you all. ""You did not have anything to do personally -- bringing yourself into this life."" You had no say-so in - the matter. The creation was not ""your own doing.""  Morphing into another topic - ""suicide.""  If you had nothing to do with -- ""bringing yourself into this life - you should have absolutely nothing to do with taking yourself out of this life either!""  You have no right to do so.   You did not create yourself therefore you have no right to destroy yourself.   There is so much interference - it used to just be on the news on the television - now it's every device that you own - ""the information highway"" of destruction..   Let's assume - that you believe in Heaven. It's just an assumption. Let's say that you have a bias - in every belief that you have? If you believe in something - you have a bias.  Whether it's a positive bias - or a negative bias - it doesn't matter -- it's a bias.  If you're a seeker of truth and you know absolutely nothing about nothing -- you don't have any bias. If you are constantly questioning everything and ""you really don't know."" You would not have a bias. Most human beings have biases. -- I'm laughing because -- it's human nature.  -- I don't believe in killing. I feel abortion is wrong. It most certainly could be construed as murder but I'm not a woman. I'm not able to get pregnant. I don't carry children. I don't have to pay for those children. I don't nurse those children. I don't have a 50+ year obligation to those children so again I don't want to get preachy. It's not my business. I have an opinion - I have a bias.  ( But there's a problem - that goes along with that belief a big problem ). All religions use fear tactics to obligate their own directions.  ""I'm going to give 'a potential scenario' I could be wrong? If you die and go to heaven you find somebody there that you had a negative bias about -- because they did something that you thought was completely wrong in this life --- and now they were not only sharing life on Earth with you -- and you're biased opinion looking down at them now you're spending all of eternity with them -- because they are forgiven 'unconditionally forgiven' for every bad act -- in Gods eyes that they did."" Remember this is ""God's Heaven"" and it's ""his rules"" and ""your biases do not play any part of his rules."" It's not ""YOU'RE IDEA OF HEAVEN.""  You can write it in a ""book but the buck stops where the ""God determines who spends time with whom on earth and in heaven!""  Let's hope that ""negative bias"" do not transcend from one dimension to the next. It has been written that if you are not happy here -- why are you waiting to go to heaven -- thinking that you will be happier there? If you think you'll be happier there -- what is stopping you -- from going now?  What is stopping you - is that you didn't create your life and you have no right to destroy it. Infants included.

LET'S EXPEL THE JOE BIDEN IS A DECENT MAN MYTH!  Add your NOT So DECENT comment and SHARE! SHARE! SHARE!  Biden is for Partial birth abortion even if the baby is partially out of the womb.   The ever-increasing size and familiarity of the second trimester fetus blurs the line between abortion and infanticide for even the most hardened professionals and preterm infants have now been recorded as surviving as early as 5 months.   This is nowhere more readily apparent than in the grotesque partial-birth abortion procedure method in which a living fetus is extracted intact from the womb only to be killed in the process of delivery. The concern to draw a bright line in the law between elective abortion and infanticide led Congress to enact the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act in 2003 which the U.S. Supreme Court upheld in 2007. The federal partial-birth abortion (PBA) law prohibits procedures where a fetus while still alive is partially delivered with the intent to take action to kill the fetus after he or she has been delivered to certain anatomical landmarks.   This is not Decent!  Biden is not for school choice eliminating the opportunity for kids to get a good education that would allow them to rise above the challenges present in poor inner-city and rural communities.   This is not Decent  Biden is not for border security!   Open borders allow unskilled people to enter our country and take jobs that unskilled and young people need to learn work skills that would allow them to gain the skills needed to move up the economic latter. Even most Hispanics citizens are for border security as a lot of their jobs are lost to these new illegal immigrants. Open borders also opens the door for gang members criminals and drugs to easily enter our country.   This is not Decent!,political,Facebook

The only reason Trump supports anti-abortion groups is because he eats babies,political,Facebook
I want you to imagine this situation. With what happened in capitol the other day and with the kind of issues now in the media on the Trump administration the many laws being broken everyday and then the notion that Christians and Christian leaders and prophets are standing behind him cheering him on. What if these acts begin to prove to the government and the rest of the world that Christianity is the cause of such anarchy? What if? Just what if.  If this happens could it lead them to begin to find a way to ban Christianity because of the intolerance they see us exhibiting and the discrimination meted out to non-believers?  If this happens would we be the ones arming them with what they need to begin to shut Christianity down as stated in the Bible? Maybe the Antichrist would then arise in order to unite the people because of what the world thinks we are doingthat we arent peaceful and loving people.  So instead of being part of the problem I stand with Christ who said Love each other and in so doing prove that you are my disciples. He also said Love your enemies. 1 Peter 2:12 says Be careful to live properly among your unbelieving neighbors. Here he didnt say to overthrow your unbelieving neighbors. He said live properly among them.  In 1 Peter 3:15-16 he explained this by saying Instead you must worship Christ as Lord of your life. And if someone asks about your hope as a believer always be ready to explain it. But do this in a gentle and respectful way. Keep your conscience clear. Then if people speak against you they will be ashamed when they see what a good life you live because you belong to Christ.  That verse says we should explain our hope in a gentle and respectful manner. We are supposed to live by example of love gentleness peace and holiness. But instead most Christians live worse than non-believers and yet we think its the law that would help them to accept Christianity when we ourselves cant even keep it? I personally dont think putting in a president or government that will enforce laws against abortion and gay is the answer. In fact Im starting to think that all the antiChrist has to do is just say Im pro-life and anti gay and he would have the vote of the Christian leaders who would disregard everything else. Remember Jesus said that if possible they will be deceived. So we need to be a little bit more spiritual.  My dear friends 2020 was a year of pruning. I pray we have been pruned. I also pray we will not aid in making Christianity the mockery of the crowd. Let us first take out the log in our own eyes.,political,Facebook
"WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE A CHRISTIAN TODAY?  We live in a very divided environment. Each day we see stories about abortion while at the same time seeing stories about people being tried in the courts for abusing an animal. We see stories about sky rocketing incidents or murder with guns. The guns are generally vilified while the people using the guns are given a pass. We see stories about tax free status for Christians being denied because Christians are generally Republicans. We see stories about all members of the white race being condemned as racists while on the other hand black lives matter. We see stories portraying our nation the United States of America as an outgrowth of slavery rather than as a continuing search for liberty and freedom. Our nation is described as a flawed and terrible place rather than an imperfect ideal searching for greater and greater perfection. Christians are under greater siege now than at any time in the past 100 years.  As these things continue to occur I feel that those who follow Jesus Christ thus who believe that he is the Son of God and the gate on the path to eternal life are being treated as members of a cult where each member believes in an invisible fantasy in a comic book story in a fictional concoction with no real meaning. I also believe there are real reasons Christians are portrayed in this manner.  First many many churches contribute to this fantasy. With their beautiful buildings and symbols with their order and structure with their entertaining music and continuous social activities; with the Sunday School classes and fellowship meetings with the meals and the yard sales with the choruses and bands with the internal networking churches provide a structure that makes both members and guests feel wanted feel cared for feel like they are joining something important. Sometimes this is true. Sometimes it is a facade; a lie.  Christians believers in Jesus Christ are not club members who can be a little bit in or half-way in. Christians are all the way in. They believe in Jesus Christ. They develop their lives around faith in Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ dictates their actions and their thoughts. This is not to say believers are perfect or even nearly perfect. As hard as they try to live as Christ lived they fall short. All members of mankind are sinners; we all fall short. During these trying times it isn't just individual Christians who fall short: it is the Church as an institution that is falling short.  In the United States of America two parts; the establishment clause and the free exercise clause of the First Amendment of the Constitution guarantee that the government will not and can not interfere with the free exercise of religion. However over the past eighteen months churches in mass have kowtowed to the government shuttered their doors locked out their congregations and failed to carry out even the most oft quoted command of our God ""Fear Not."" They have willingly given up their freedom under the Constitution and failed to obey God. This surrender of autonomy this abdication of authority has totally undermined the importance of organized religion in our country. Instead of acting independently to go forward in their collective trust in the sanctity and authority of Jesus Christ they have surrendered to fear. Instead of moving forward with their activities while at the same time presenting alternatives to those who did fear the churches closed their doors and became social media platforms; just another source of information. Organized churches stripped off the armor of God and bared themselves to the assaults of heathens.  At the same time they were giving away their power and authority the churches failed to take firm stands against sins clearly enunciated in the Bible. They failed to take a stand within the constraints of the Word of God. Thousands of churches condone and accept abortion of children. Thousands of additional churches accept the leadership of those bragging about and consistently seeking deviant life styles; lives as homosexuals or lesbians; lives as bisexuals; lives during which they surgically change the characteristics of their biological gender or lifestyles during which they claim to be of a different gender or of no gender. They celebrate their ""pride"" in their deviance. Though the church is entrusted to accept these behaviors; after all they are simply different sins from stealing lying cheating worshipping idols etc.; the church should always accept these behaviors with the grace and tolerance of knowing that those who believe will seek to minimize to eliminate the frequency of their sinning; that they will strive to achieve a more sin free life. Many many churches are failing to accomplish even that. Additional churches are accepting of these behaviors to the point of putting those who practice this behavior into leadership positions. Satan leading the flock. How appropriate in this evil society in which we live.  Of even greater import to those who attend traditional churches should be the lack of outreach the failure to carry out the instructions of Jesus Christ to love our neighbors to treat our neighbors as ourselves to help others. Many churches have little or not outreach few or no ministries designed to help those around them. Tens of thousands of churches do little more than maintain the building in which they meet and pay those tasked with instructing them in the ways of Jesus Christ. If it were not so sad it would be almost humorous that three average guys have met every week face to face in the homes of one another each Sunday fixed a breakfast each week engaged in fellowship conducted a sermon or class every seven days periodically offered Communion developed a website and a local presence and conduct many many ministries within our community. Not only do we build the occasional ramp for the handicapped provide food boxes to elderly Jews support Angel Tree programs for many children assist with the care of the homeless send the children of incarcerated men and women to summer camps but are also active in assisting other ministries to obtain and build busses for use during emergencies support Kairos to visit and minister to those incarcerated participate in the multi-denominational men's group in Northeaster North Carolina but also support Emmaus to provide more intensive support to practicing Christians. To be blunt we are not scared have not been scared and have blatantly disobeyed the governments attempts to control us. Furthermore as a group we have been chastised by other Christians for our beliefs and our actions.  Jesus Christ did not have an easy life. Being a man is not easy. Following Jesus Christ is not easy and it was never intended to be so. If you are going to proclaim yourself to be a Christian it is time to open your hearts attempt to discern what God is telling you to do put on your big-boy pants and start doing your jobs. Though Jesus Christ never coined ""The Great Commission"" he did tell us to make disciples of all nations and to baptize them. Go out and do it. Do not allow others to tell you that you are wrong and can not do it. GO OUT AND DO! Being a Christian is being in action.",political,Facebook

Theres a group of us retired folks out every day knocking on doors.   Were all Republicans and we dont like what Matt Bevin is doing. So were knocking on doors.  Were all Kentuckians and we know Bevin doesnt like us because he calls our fellow Kentuckians thugs. So were knocking on doors.   Some of us voted for Bevin four years ago but were knocking on doors to tell folks we were wrong and we need to make it right. This time we all completely reject Bevin and were all voting for Beshear. So were knocking on doors   We know this election isnt about anything national or any politicians in Washington DC. This election is about education and healthcare and treating us Kentuckians with respect rather than treating us as people to make a buck off of. So were knocking on doors.   We know that this election isnt about abortion or sanctuary cities or scary pictures Bevin uses in his TV ads. We know we arent dumb Kentucky voters that will swallow Bevins ads that dont talk about his accomplishments but try to scare us. So were knocking on doors.   We know that our tax money should be used frugally. We know it ABSOLUTELY is our business when Bevin uses OUR STATE PLANE to fly to DC to raise money from big Drug companies. So were knocking on doors.   Were all taxpayers and we know how much we pay in taxes. We know what Andy Beshear pays in taxes because he told us. We dont know what Bevin pays because he wont. So were knocking on on doors.   We know Bevin bought a mansion from one of his political donors for HALF PRICE. We know thats cheating. So were knocking on doors.   We know Bevin wants to take healthcare away from people on Medicaid in Southeastern Kentucky who are able-bodied but dont have good paying jobs because there arent any. We know when Arkansas did this and set up the same program to check in ONLINE to keep your benefits that people were stripped of benefits when they didnt have access to the INTERNET to check in just like a lot of Southeastern Kentucky and poor people throughout the state. So we knock on doors.   We know Bevins Medicaid plan will cost over $271 MILLION to create the bureaucracy to manage it. And that comes from OUR TAX MONEY! So we knock on doors.   Theres a group of us across the state knocking on doors. Were retired folks instead of sitting at home watching TV were knocking on doors. Were Republicans knocking on doors.

Governor Coopers Veto Overridden  Today despite the fact that Democrats now hold a veto-proof majority in the NC Senate the Governors veto of Senate Bill 359 Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act was overridden with a one-vote margin that was provided by a Democratic member of the Senate. The Governor appropriately vetoed this bill since the issue the bill sought to address is already illegal in NC. Essentially the purpose of this bill was to protect infants that were born alive after an attempted abortion procedure. This bill creates a false perception that doctors are engaged in improper conduct and practices which have never occurred in our state. Even the bills sponsor admitted this during debate and discussion relating to this bill that there had never been a single reported incident in the State of North Carolina of this ever occurring. If it were to occur then the medical licensing board as well as existing laws would address this. Please do not buy into this false narrative which is meant to intimidate doctors into not performing abortions.  We already have laws that will protect an unborn infant in its mothers womb if someone attempted to injure a pregnant woman and the infant died as a result of injuries the woman or the infant sustained. One of the things the new law would have done is to essentially deputize nurses or those assisting a doctor in an operating room by requiring them to report a doctor who did not take the necessary steps to assist an infant in distress however as stated previously there is not a single reported case in the State of North Carolina where this type of incident has ever occurred. I am disappointed that after fighting hard to break the Republican supermajority in order to be able to sustain our Governors veto today we were unsuccessful in doing so.,political,Facebook
"On May 30th 2018 the radical Left in Virginia passed a swathe of their prized liberal policies.  Record billion-dollar spending along with MILLIONS of dollars in tax hikes...  ...Expansion of the Socialist Obamacare Medicaid scheme...  ...Gun control AND taxpayer funding for abortion...  You'd probably think this far-left laundry list was passed with a Democrat majority.  But you'd be wrong.  You see our 'Republican' Delegate Bob Thomas voted for this whole scheme.  Thomas voted to raise our taxes by over $600 million bust our budget with the largest spending increase in Virginia's history AND rammed through Obamacare's Medicaid expansion scheme.  To make matters worse Thomas voted for a brand new $6 million taxpayer slush fund for abortion groups like Planned Parenthood and voted against the right of our emergency first responders to bear arms.  I wish I didn't have to write you this letter.  I wish that the Republican we sent to Richmond actually stuck to his word and voted like a true conservative.  It's bad enough we have a Democrat Party on the warpath to grow Big Government stamp out our freedoms and defy President Trump -- but when Republicans do it it's time to take action.  That's why I'm running in the June 11th Republican primary to replace Bob Thomas in the House of Delegates.  So please allow me to take a few seconds to tell you more about myself and my campaign.  Unlike Bob Thomas I understand that lowering taxes while slashing government spending and regulations are vital to fueling our economy's growth.  I witnessed it first hand.  First as the business owner of CIP Finishes a multimillion dollar commercial hardware company in Stafford and then when I served on the Stafford County Board of Supervisors.  As Supervisor I cut MILLIONS of dollars in taxes by repealing the job-crushing Business Professional and Occupational (BPOL) tax and reduced personal property taxes.  I successfully fought to return tax dollars to the hardworking citizens who earned them. But I still made sure to fund key areas like education public safety and transportation.  As a result our economy took off creating over 10000 new jobs in the past decade as Stafford County's bond ratings increased from AA to AAA status.  I'm proud to call the Stafford community my home and have for over 30 years.  I cannot think of a better place to raise a family than in the Stafford community. In fact it feels like it was just yesterday that my two kids Bailey and Travis were attending Stafford High School.  Outside of politics I attend Andrew Chapel Methodist Church.  I strive to remain active in our community by serving on the Regional Transportation Action Committee on the Chamber of Commerce financially supporting the Adopt-a-Classroom initiative at Stafford High School and volunteering with the Stafford SPCA and other organizations. I've also been a Rotarian for over 10 years and a Lions Club member for over 15 years.  It's that very passion for serving our community -- and a commitment to conservative principles -- that led me to the decision to run for Virginia House of Delegates.  But if you're like me you're worried about an ever-growing government eroding the values you and I hold dear.  Fortunately President Trump is fighting back against liberals in Washington.  I wish I could say that Delegate Bob Thomas was fighting back against the liberals in Richmond.  While President Trump drains the Swamp in D.C. Bob Thomas and his liberal pals are doing the opposite.  In fact Bob Thomas spit in the face of the Trump administration and rammed through the expansion of Obamacare in Virginia.  Even USA Today reported that ""The expansion of the government health insurance program was strongly opposed by the Trump administration which has sought to repeal Obamacare outright.""  Sadly the list of Thomas' votes against the conservative cause continues.  Bob Thomas also joined Democrats in voting to fund the abortion lobby's cash cow Planned Parenthood with $2.6 million in additional taxpayer funds -- the same Planned Parenthood that donated nearly $2 million to Democrat Governor Ralph Northam!  That was just after Bob Thomas voted against the gun rights of our EMS first responders.  To make matters worse all of this could have been blocked.  Republicans control Virginia's House of Delegates with a one-seat majority. But Bob Thomas was the only local Republican that joined virtually EVERY Democrat in voting for this liberal agenda  We're Republicans. Our party fights against Big Government and against government-run healthcare schemes.  And we should ALWAYS fight to protect the unborn and defend the Second Amendment.  Sadly these conservative ideas don't matter to Bob Thomas.  Now Bob Thomas has been trying to fool voters about his record with glossy mailers slick radio ads and paid phone calls. But his votes tell another story.  His record of exploding government to record spending levels hiking taxes and creating a new slush fund for the nation's largest abortion provider is the REAL Bob Thomas.  That's why I had to get in this race.  I'm running because Bob Thomas broke his promises.  I hope you'll agree to support my campaign by signing your pledge of support right away:  And after you sign your pledge please prayerfully consider a personal contribution. $250 $100 $50 or even just $25 or $10 can fund the grassroots mobilization program my campaign has designed to win this race.  Your generous support will help my campaign purchase the lawn signs email social media ads direct mail and door-to-door canvassing that has propelled grassroots candidates to victory around the country.  With President Donald Trump in the White House the last thing Republicans need is a Delegate like Bob Thomas joining Democrats in promoting Pelosi's liberal agenda.  So I hope you'll agree to support my campaign to remove Bob Thomas from office in the June 11th Republican primary.  Please sign your pledge of support and pitch in your most generous personal contribution right away:  God Bless you for your support.  Sincerely  Paul",political,Facebook
During elections it's natural for candidates to draw distinctions between one another. Sadly sometimes candidates with few ideas or little understanding of legislation resort to tactics beneath the people of our district and I wanted to address that with you directly.  As a Christian who believes in service truth courage and honor my anti-abortion position means that I am strongly pro-child and pro-family. Its critical that we prioritize womens healthcare access to birth control education programs hunger and food insecurity when entering pro-life discussions. These are the cornerstones to not only reducing abortion but to reducing unplanned pregnancies and to empowering families with resources they need to be healthy.  Knowledge of and support for families foster children and Arkansas adoptions are also incredibly important and without understanding these issues our women and children will suffer. We have to break cycles of poverty and lower staggeringly high teenage birth rates. These are issues I champion and will continue to fight for.  Im proud to have served this district for four years carefully studying the real issues state legislators can work on together. I hold extremely dear my Christian values my 30-year military history and my record of service to the people of Arkansas.  Ill be honored to earn your vote on November 3 and to continue serving you. Together we have made District 9 a better place to live and together well keep going strong  with truth transparency and strong ideas. #bringbackburch #LeadershipMatters,political,Facebook

Those of you who are pro life know that since abortion was legalized in the United States it has killed twice as many people as the Nazi holocaust. Girl and boy babies have lost the right to control their own bodies and have been murdered wholesale. There is some hope that changes in the Supreme Court may gradually save some babies and now is the time for good people to unite in screaming their opposition to the killing through demonstrations protests civil disobedience lobbying politicians pro-life voting.,political,Facebook

The following is a letter that B GEN. Dave Papak U.S. USMC (RET) and Coach Joe Ravasio wrote in response to my opponent's false mailers. The letter was intended for the local paper. The local paper is not printing political letters at this time. Dave and Joe gave me the letter to share.  Lets Just Set the Record Straight:  Recently the Republican candidate for the 49th House District of PA has been under attack by the incumbent. Recent flyers falsely accused Mr. Bottino of the following:   Bottino was falsely labeled liberal  He is a very strong conservative.   Tonys opponent said Tony Bottino has remained silent while Wolf pushed for more taxes gun control and abortion.  Tony Bottino has NOT YET been elected State Representative and he does NOT YET have a voice in Harrisburg. Everyone Tony has met and spoken to knows that he is a VERY STRONG PRO-LIFE and PRO-SECOND AMENDMENT supporter and he STRONGLY OPPOSES ANY TAX INCREASES   Tonys opponent said Bottino is being bankrolled by the politically connected who put their friends before your family. Tony has always been a servant to his friends business associates and community. He has NEVER nor will he ever sell his soul to anyone.   Tonys opponent said Tony Bottino is endorsed by the same liberal bosses who fund Wolf and attack President Trump. Tony Bottino has never endorsed voted for or assisted in any manner Governor Wolf. He and his family have been always supportive of President Trump.   As many of you are aware Governor Wolf visited Monongahela during Sept. 2019 and on his tour of the downtown area he was impressed at the level of development he witnessed. (As referenced by the photo of Governor Wolf and then Monongahela Area Chamber of Commerce President Tony Bottino).   As Tonys football coach and friend for the past 35 years I trust him because of his excellent character values of honesty integrity compassion his tremendous leadership skills and tenacity.   So to set the record straight Republicans can trust Tony Bottino. You can be sure that what Tony Bottino accomplished as Monongahela Chamber President State Representative Tony Bottino will do for the rest of the 49thDistrict.   So before you vote on June 2nd. we just wanted to set the record straight   We thank you for this opportunity to share the Tony Bottino we KNOW and TRUST. May God bless you and may God bless America.  Coach Joe Ravasio  B GEN. Dave Papak U.S. USMC (RET),political,Facebook
I Had A Serious & Common Question Asked Of Me About Abortion. - This Is My Reply. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- If your daughter is raped by someone. Is that still Gods will or was it Satanic? Would you want your daughter to have the child? Im just wondering. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- This is one of those difficult decisions I know what you mean & appreciate the civil way you asked it. My first reaction would be yes abortion.  But then as I processed it I would think differently but my daughter would also need to be on board. If she & anyone would be scripturally faithful the fetus would still be a life & through no blame to it this awful act happen.  If allowed to live & given up for adoption the baby could become a Doctor Teacher or who knows. 98% of abortions are done because a girl or woman is just screwing around gets pregnant & doesn't want the baby.  The other 2% or less is rape or the life of the Mother is at risk. THIS IS A HARD ONE FOR SURE AND WOULD TAKE A GREAT DEAL OF FAITH TO DEAL WITH.,political,Facebook
