Independence Day- 4th of July We are all hearing a lot of heartbreaking rhetoric of people concerned about celebrations of our Patriotism being diminshed. The appearance is being held as some type of blatant challenge to our free republic and our democratic rights as a nation of the most diverse and inclusive nation on Earth. Yes it came with a vision struggles challenges and took tenacity of every soul to get to where we are. Patriotic reflections such as: The Pledge of Allegiance One Nation Under God The Star Spangled Banner Saluting (hand over heart) for the Pledge of Allegiance flying the most beautiful flag of the United States dimishing Law Enforcement and our Brave Military and so much more are questioned. Attempts to shun our patriotic heritage is crying loudly for the people of this great country to be silenced. STAND UP AMERICA SPEAK UP AMERICA. Celebrate OUT LOUD this great country. NO ONE CAN SILENCE YOU BUT YOU! Drown out the soothsayers of the cra cra groups by being a beacon of the Light of America. Live it Love it Celebrate it. Happy 4th of July! Independence Day of all of its people!,political,Facebook
This is the thinking and the worries of a 14 years old boy that loves his country. My son Daniel Nez.  4th of July speech -  My fellow Americans today marks the 244th anniversary of our independence from Great Britain. We declared independence from an oppressive monarchy that violated and infringed on our rights two hundred forty-four years ago. Brave individuals that dared to stand up to the most significant military power in the world. They were uncertain if they could win that fight but they stood up in defiance and courage and their faith in their sleeves. They won that fight and thanks to their efforts we are celebrating this Independence Day. In these 244 years we have faced and accomplished much. We have continued our stride to become a more perfect union. We have faced challenges small and large but in all of these challenges we have met them with the same American resolve that won us our independence. In these 244 years we have seen countless wars. A civil war two world wars and a Cold War. These wars testing if our union could survive making us question if the American experiment could go on to see another day. We have passed each test we have risen to the moment each time with honor and courage and we have come out a better union. Today on Independence Day we celebrate our triumphs and our losses. But we also think about the threats facing us today. Threats both internal and external.A danger that seeks to topple our democracy and the west. A danger that indoctrinates our children with un-American ideals and that wishes to separate us based on physical qualities. These threats believe that the American fire that guided us through these 244 years has been extinguished. Threats that believe that America's best days are behind it and that America faces imminent collapse. I wholly and utterly reject these claims. I believe that our best days are ahead of us and I believe that we can topple these enemies. So on this day I ask you to put aside your differences and remember what we all have in common; we are all Americans. We all believe in a common goal the goal of preserving our union. I ask you today to reach out to your family your neighbor and friends and celebrate this day and this country. Engage in civil conversation and remember we are all Americans Thank-you and God bless the United States. Daniel Nez. A 14 years old boy.,political,Facebook

Decline of Judeo-Christian America is  the fault of our religious leaders  This title may sound strange misleading or even insulting but that is not so. To understand this title we have to understand the difference between the intellectual and dogmatic faiths in both Judaism and Christianity.  Let me describe it in regard to Judaism where my spiritual roots are and I am sure something similar could be found in Christianity.  Intellectual Faith  The Intellectual Faith is rooted in the Torah (Old Testament) itself.  The ancient tribes found (or created) their own gods who delivered the requested outcome in exchange for gifts.  At the same ancient times one of the tribes the future Jewish Nation found (or created for those who despise the word God) the God of Morality  the Morality of the Ten Commandments and Individual Freedoms in the image and likeness of God.  The guidance of this God was simple although not easy to understand: continue My Creative Work along the line of My Morality.  And for the next over millennium timeline the Jewish Nation was learning (with multiple errors) how to do it. The entire Torah (Old Testament) describes this learning process.  Something new happened two millenniums ago that led to the birth of Dogmatic Faith.  Dogmatic faith  What happened was the Great Jewish Exile! The Jews were expelled from the Promised Land by the Romans  expelled to many foreign lands where the danger of forced assimilation and abandoning the life by the Gods morality was real.  And the Jewish religious leaders (about two hundred rabbis over about two centuries) created the Talmud  the well-known 613 rabbinical commandments the dogmatic Jewish Faith intended to secure the survival of the Chosen People until the better times (the coming of Messiah?).  The better times began coming about three centuries ago with the liberation from the Royal/Clerical despotism in Europe and the USA. That was the time for the Jewish religious leaders to begin the revival of the Jewish Intellectual faith as the Chosen people  for both the Jews and the Christians in spite of the mighty antisemitism. Unfortunately that was not happened and that paved the way for the new forces of division and suppression  the forces of various shapes of Marxist Faith (analyzed in detail in this Blog).  Where we are now and what to do  In America the national Judeo-Christian Intellectual faith is being replaced by an American version of the totalitarian Marxist faith. And the only way to stop it is the return of American religious leaders to the Intellectual Faith and mobilization of their followers for the actions in public arena.  The victory of Conservatives over Liberals may help but not resolve the core issue because Conservatism is trying to preserve everything as it is while the Intellectual Faith guides to continue the Gods creative work that means the Change.  The victory of Republican Party over Democratic Party may help but not resolve the same core issue because a political party in power is legislating with the purpose of preserving its political might  not for restoring and preserving the power of Gods morality.  The victory of fighters for religious freedoms may help but resolve the same core issue because they are fighting for the freedom of worship  not for the freedom to lead the public in the fight for restoring and preserving the power of Gods morality in the government.  The only way to restoring and preserving the Judeo-Christian America is to create a voting majority spiritually fit to elect the government spiritually capable to govern along the lines of Intellectual Faith that is along the lines of the Ten Commandments and Individual Freedoms.  From the news-media  In his first speech to the United Nations General Assembly Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett pleaded to see Israel not as forever entrenched in warfare but as a contributing member of the international community. Israel Bennett said at the outset is a beacon of democracy diverse by design innovative by nature and eager to contribute to the world. For way too long Israel was defined by wars with our neighbors Bennett said. But this is not what Israel is about. This is not what the people of Israel are about.,political,Facebook
The Wedge  Im proudly a child of the 80s. The music was great fashion not so great and the Cold War was still present but a far cry from the Cuban Missile Crisis of the 1960s. We as a nation by and large recognized ourselves as part of an American family so to speak and the world as it were seemed safe. Whether you loved him or hated him The Reagan principle of Peace through Strength kept the world on as even of a keel as one could ask for. I played after school incessantly with my friends and we had a favorite game called War. The rules were simple as one might imagine each kid brought his biggest and best toy guns and we played for hours a breed of hide n seek only with weapons. To my knowledge none of my former playmates to this day have ever been involved in a mass shooting. Looking through the prism of history it was a glorious time where for once the old divisions did not seem to matter anymore. Minorities and women had ascended to some of the highest levels of leadership and industry and as a rule the term race and racism seemed to be remnants of a bygone era. Today there exist a wedge that has been driven like a wooden stake straight through the heart of this country. It has pitted us against each other in a way that I personally never thought we could develop into. It is though we have been separated and resegregated based on characteristics that run antithetical to everything the Civil Rights Movement stood for. What is the wedge exactly and more importantly how did we get here? To have an honest discussion about this topic we must all concede that leaders no matter what their stripes have the ability to be polarizing. I categorize two types of polarizing figures. There are those that are polarizing for the right reasons and those that divide for every reason that is wrong. For example Ben Shapiro in my opinion a polarizing figure for the right reasons. He makes honest fair assessments of situations in a time where for some reason this is looked upon as divisive hate speech even white supremacy which is remarkably interesting when you take into account that Ben Shapiro is an Orthodox Jew. Then you have the Linda Sarsars of the world whose rhetoric and speech are not only hateful but backed up in no way by fact or reason. As we all know Ben Shapiro should not be a polarizing figure but is because the time of real true free speech is over. Stereotypes as well have made a huge return only now the focus seems to be on mainly white America. If we are to have a true discussion we must be honest. Is there any other ethnicity in America today that is subjected to the level of sensitivity training and whatever else they can think of to somehow make white people feel bad about themselves? If that kind of action were perpetrated on any other ethnic group in this country it would be a return to slave days I guess Im not sure where you really go once youve played the Jim Crow Card. The leadership in Washington though divided by obvious ideological differences are all capable of injecting themselves into situations where it is not needed or make a bone headed statement that only serves to fan the flames of whatever the divide may be. In the years since the 80s and leading into the modern times the division has come at the hands of neo-progressives who seek to silence any opinion that might challenge their deeply held beliefs. Notice I did not say the left because quite frankly I grew up side by side with the left and the right but this new breed of ultra-left thinkers have somehow managed to find a way to completely dominate the narrative in this nation. Perhaps even worse though the ugly specter of racism has returned but it is a form of racism that is by and large imagined and always rooted in suppositions that just do not make any sense. The United States in many ways is comparable to a High School. Where there is an endless number of cliques each convinced of their superior thought and superior ideas. What has come to pass as a superior idea in contemporary society can be as simple as a completely reality detached statement made by someone paid millions of dollars to play a game. Nothing on its face seems to make much sense anymore. Its as though every positive statement about America has a but. We are a compassionate and generous nation but we are systemically racist internally. Millions of people from all over the world dream of making it to our shores but we are an extremely oppressive society especially with those that are different from us. Of course you receive the same chorus of statements that get more to the point. America is driven by white supremacy. America is and always has been about inequality. With the presence of such inane and blanket statements where does anyone find any common ground? When one makes a blanket statement about an entire race of people how do you approach that person and try to have a dialogue to try and better understand why it is they feel this way. With the actions of the past year getting a man on the street opinion might get you beat up. It is like we are all out to get each other but for what. Does Black America really believe that myself and millions just like me hate them and think that somehow they are less than in my eyes. It is a proposition that sounds absolutely ludicrous and yet I guarantee you could find quite a few people who believe that. How did people in America come to think such things politics plain and simple. In the days before the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the accompanying Civil Rights Movement black Americans especially those in the south found themselves not much better off than the days that they were in bondage. Back breaking work share cropping and making barely enough to keep your family fed. This time in American history is where we witnessed a mass migration to the cities of America in search of not only jobs but a hope to escape the segregation and subhuman treatment of the deep south. In the cities there were jobs to be had and money to be made for those that possessed the entrepreneurial spirit. It seemed like a perfect formula. The only problem was is that though black America thought that the north was this place where racism somehow did not exist or at least not as bad as what they had experienced outside the city. However they would find like in all big cities people are by and large neo-phobic. As a result they saw that even though they had made the move to the city the racism and discrimination still existed. The wages were there but were usually barely enough to keep a roof over your head and food on the table. Slowly but surely the inner cities of the US became harder and harder places to live as violence and crime began to run rampant. The poverty and despair that existed back then that still to this day causes so many to think that the only way out is to turn to fast money. Pity that fast money and crime are almost synonymous with each other. In the 1960s post JFK the POTUS was a rather vile racist Im not proud to say is from my home State of Texas. Lyndon Baines Johnson was one of those Presidents whose legacy is bathed in young Americans blood and rife with racist policies that have helped more than anything to mold society into what it is today. At the time minorities in the inner cities were certainly victims and at that time I think the idea of welfare as a means to get you on your feet was not such a bad policy. Almost from the start though folks were gaming and using the system so that they could stay home all day and do whatever they wanted so long as the check kept coming every month. My paternal Grandfather of whom I am proudly his namesake passed away in 1966 leaving my Grandma to take care of herself and four kids. Though no one in the world could think of a more deserving family in need of help my Grandma refused to go on welfare. She elected instead to take a job as a Secretary and worked for almost 50 years in that field. An old friend of my Grandpa built houses and let my Grandma finance through his company and though it was hard my Dad and his three siblings never wanted for anything. My Dad told me that sometimes it annoyed him that the people on welfare made more money than his family and never lifted a finger. Welfare was meant to be a temporary fix but as LBJ knew full well it was an elaborate ruse to turn the minorities of this nation into a dependent class of citizens. Is it any wonder that crime remained even metastasized in some cases and slowly but surely the fatherless rate began to increase? The biggest cause of father absence in my humble opinion is that through welfare women did not need a man if she did not want one. Her check would still come whether her babies Daddy hung around or not. This factor plus men shirking their responsibilities and the worst scourge of all abortion have all been the perfect mixture to make folks in inner cities not only dependent but reliable in that the politicians know so long as they keep dolling the people will keep voting. The Great Society veiled in all its promise to rid the country of poverty and make racial equality the forefront of LBJs agenda. In truth he once told a staffer that if he could get his legislation passed he would Have those ni##ers voting democrat for 200 years. It was all by design to keep minorities where he and many of his fellow Democrats exactly wanted them poor and dependent in the cities. Not empowerment to be able to have access to better jobs and a chance at the American dream but in essence to completely re-enslave the inner-city minorities of this nation. One need look no further than the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina to see still how dependent people are on the government. This is the systemic racism that people speak of. Though the media has done its part to fan the flames the politicians have constantly used incidents of crime to weaponize racism against their political foes. The unholy alliance between the media and the left has served to do nothing but bring this nation to a point that I am actually afraid. Post George Floyd which was an amazing opportunity for us to unite but was immediately politicized and the anarchy that followed may never be repaired. Every time I think that we have common ground someone or some group comes in and makes it about racism though the reasons get more and more insane by the day. So much so that AOC recently lectured all of us to remind us that even Climate change is to blame for racism. I keep waiting for Rod Serling to jump out and tell me what I am seeing is not real. So far to date I am still waiting. So what is the solution? I will not cop out and say your guess is as good as mine but in reality its pretty much the truth. I can remember the Black Power movement of my generation with Public Enemy and everyone having their Sista Soljah moment. After the election of a two-term black President I had thought that maybe we were back to a time where race was not the end all be all of human existence. I keep trying to think about legislation that has already been proposed yet every time I turn around our current President is reminding me that I am inherently racist. It is utterly amazing; he knows things about me that I dont even know myself. There must be common ground though. Somewhere out there something must exist that we can all as Americans be proud of and rally behind. I have seen so many great activists try to do that very thing and have had success doing it. People like Starr Parker and the great Candace Owens come to mind. I admire their ability to look critically at the real problems in America today no matter how vile the backlash may be. I do not want to sit at the table with ANTIFA or BLM for that matter. All they do is divide us at every possible turn. I genuinely believe that with grassroots organizing most especially with faith leaders is our only chance to affect a positive change on the Wedge that constantly is hammered to drive us all further and further apart. It pains me to go through social media these days and hear almost a hope for a civil war. I know I do not want that and I believe in my heart that most Americans do not either. I have always tried to teach my children to be color blind. My wife and I must be doing something right because almost without exception my kids best friends are minorities. I truly hope and pray that maybe one day we will again be the American family where everyones opinion is protected. Where we can come together to find solutions to the problems that we have because they are hard and require us all. Our leaders are supposed to be the ones that work to unite us the most. Politics is not a service done out of responsibility so much as opportunity. So long as that is what motivates the majority of legislators nothing will change. Let us not give up though. Just like I believe that we do not need the government intruding into our lives I do not want them intruding in our differences either. The best charity and the best help has always come from citizens acting on their own. We must share this land whether we like it or not is it truly too much to hope that we can share what brings us together. It can happen. We all can affect change in our own lives. We all make the world the way it is and as has been said through history a house divided cannot stand.  The Pamphleteer,political,Facebook

"Revival comes when we turn away from our wickedness and repent and pray and seek God's face then He will hear and forgive and heal this nation this state this city. So many sins and so little time for the day of our Lord's return is drawing nearer. Within the past thirty-five years or so we have seen the separation of church and state legalization of abortion removal of the Ten Commandments from our schools and Government buildings and the legalization of same-sex marriage! Oh what an abomination these are to our Heavenly Father! How He must be grieving at this very moment for His lost children! When Christ returns where will you be? A famous philospher once said ""The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing."" Which way are we going America? Which way are you as a Christian going? Will you help to create a revival in America? Will be willing to pray for our nation? To stand up and be counted? Lift up your voices and take a stand for righteousness! Pray for a great spiritual awakening throughout this nation and for people's hearts to turn back to God. The choice is up to you-God's Way or the world's way! Would you like to discuss the end times in the Book of Revelations and in the Gospels and feel better because of what it is saying to us as Christians? While we wait for the return of the Christ? If you have some questions about the end times...If you have concerns about what will happen to you...If you like to look to the end times as a source of comfort and not chaos we need to prepare our hearts and minds as to Jesus' return His return will be the ""beginning of the very best"". Our primary task is to be prepared and peaceful while we wait for His return. Jesus urges us ""Don't let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God and trust in me"".

Section 98 therefore anyone who declares the suspension of Constitutionally guaranteed rights and or attempts to enforce such suspension within 50 independent sovereign continental United States of America is making war against our Constitution and therefore we the people. They violate their Constitutional oath and thus immediately forfeit their office and authority and their proclamations may be disregarded with impunity and that means anyone; even the Governor or President.  That is why THEY support the government breaking the Constitution and stealing $500000 which with interest has now exceeded $1500000!

Dems always boycott and protest and companies give in. Why ? Because conservatives say and do nothing in a similar fashion. We don't make our voices heard to corporate america. This needs to stop . Asking for identification to vote is not jim crow Is not racist and is not a violation of your basic freedom. Believing that an entire group of people are too stupid to be able to get an ID to vote is racist. The irony is rich Especially coming from a party that believes to exercise another constitutional right owning a gun . you not only have to prove who you are but you need not only an FBI background check  but a complete psychological evaluation including interviews with your exes to be worthy of it.,political,Facebook
About my career.  Someone made mention the other day Just wait until they start digging into his past in law enforcement.  So instead of the normal Monday musing where I provide my stand on issues or how I intend to change and move the department forward I will go over my career in law enforcement.  The first time I put on a police officer uniform was as a reserve officer for the city of Cahokia IL. It was a non-paid position as most reserve positions are. I did this from 1975 to 1979. It was my first exposure to law enforcement and found I thoroughly enjoyed it. Left that department as a Sergeant.  My next time in uniform was with the Department of Public Safety Agana Guam. I began that stint in 1981 after graduating from an 8 month police academy. I was certified to patrol by myself and averaged 20 to 30 hours a week. I worked the majority of my time as a Traffic Officer investigating DUIs and traffic crashes. I also spent a short time with the horse mounted unit! While in the traffic unit I participated in an investigation looking for several suspects wanted in a number of homicides which included the death of one officer. I was part of the team that located them and during the standoff one officer was shot multiple times. My efforts to save the Officer resulted in me being awarded the Silver Star for bravery. I was promoted to Lieutenant and was in charge of training for reserve officers. I left that position in 1983. And once again it was non-pay!  Then in 1991 I went to the Reserve Officer academy in Jacksonville Florida. I continued the reserve status through January 1993. While a Reserve Officer I was awarded a commendation from the Fire Department for my efforts in saving a man from a burning car. Again this was a non-pay status.  I attended the Basic Law Enforcement Training Academy in Jacksonville starting in August 1992 and graduating in January 1993. I was hired by the City of Jacksonville Beach as a paid reserve officer for about 90 days enough to complete my field training. I was then hired to work full time. I worked for Jax Bach PD until September 1995. As an officer with that department I voluntarily took on an investigation that resulted in the arrest of a serial killer by the name of Gary Ray Bowles. I ended up with an awful lot of attention from people across the country as well as a segment on Americas Most Wanted and a commendation.  I was hired by the Jacksonville Sheriffs Office in September 1995 and stayed there until I retired in June 2014. As an Officer there I worked in Patrol the Community Policing Unit (COPS) Burglary Gang Unit Economic Crimes and the Aggravated Battery unit within the Homicide division. However the majority of my career was with the Narcotics Unit. I was first assigned there in 1998 and left in 2012. While in Narcotics I worked everything from buying drugs from low level drug dealers to purchasing kilograms to extremely complicated investigations involving wire taps as well as federal prosecutions. I also worked as a DEA Task Force Officer for about a year. I had much success in making entry and arrests in areas and organizations where others had failed. While at the Sheriffs Office I was awarded Officer of the Month three times and Officer of the Year once. Each time I was selected out of a department of approximately 1700 officers. Oh and I am frequently seen on the television show COPS in reruns!  In February of 2019 I was hired to work at the Public Safety Training Center at the Southwestern Community College. I was tasked with coordinating in-service training as well as advanced training for area departments. Additionally I obtained my North Carolina Law Enforcement General Instructor certification and currently teach recruits. I resigned all but my instructor duties to pursue my goal of being your next Sheriff!  Sorry for the length but I wanted to give you a snapshot of the highlights of my career. I am extremely well qualified to be the next Sheriff of Macon County and look forward to discussing my vision to move it forward.,political,Facebook
I am vaccinated. My family and I made the very real and personal decision to take the vaccine because we believe that to be the best way to stay safe from COVID-19. I have encouraged others  family friends and constituents alike  to do the same.  But the best thing about America is the freedom to make these decisions for ourselves  as individuals. It is not the responsibility of the federal government to decide for individuals whether or not to take the vaccine. Joe Bidens unprecedented vaccine mandates tells millions of Americans that they have but one choice: get the shot  or else you lose your ability to earn a living pay your bills and feed your family.  Thats not freedom. Thats not liberty. Thats not America.  Forcing vaccines on Americans by way of executive fiat is unconstitutional and I will do everything in my power as a legislator in Mississippi to resist this unconstitutional assault on liberty and freedom.,political,Facebook
One of the things that have always made our military strong is the willingness of even the low ranking to take initiative when there is a gap in the leadership structure. In wars past long ago it was commented on by both friend and enemy. Think is was just part of the American DNA.  I fear we are in danger of losing that with the rise of the nanny state. With confirmation being pushed not only by government but the purity tests the major parties push.  We count on the government telling us what is right and wrong we see it al all levels of society and with it we lose our ability to think and act on our own. We have colleges and schools teaching the test over how to find answers on our own it is making us dependent on the state to guide us. This needs to stop America.,political,Facebook

Last night an old Army Buddy messaged me. He asked me to do a post about the 14th Amendment. After reviewing the 14th Amendment I have to admit I was ashamed that I had not done a post on it previously. We frequently discuss the 1st 2nd and the 5th Amendments but in reality no amendment speaks more about our rights as Americans then the 14th Amendment. On my webpage the first sentence on the about page we talk about the Declaration of Independence and how all men are created equal. However the truth is the document that followed the Declaration of Independence the Constitution did not treat all people equal it was not until the 14th Amendment that the situation was rectified.  Section 1 of the 14th Amendment reads  All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.  I talk about the 2nd Amendment being pretty plain speaking the 14th Amendment is no different. Section 5 specifically states that all citizens will be given equal protection under the law. In 2021 we still have issues with that and there is no excuse for it. People of color are disproportionately given harsher sentences for the same crimes committed by their white counterparts. We have racial profiling; we people of African Asian and Hispanic decent being told to go back where they came from even though they are American citizens. There is no excuse for it.  A couple years ago my wife and I were looking at adopting a teenager that was under state jurisdiction. It breaks my heart that so many of these teenagers have been in the system as long as they have. We are talking years not months. One of the young people we looked at was black he wanted to live a farm life and loved animals so it appeared a good fit. At that time I reached out to various black Americans I had served with over the years I also reached out to an old Commander of mine who had a mixed race daughter to get their advice and see if they were willing to help me with mentoring the child to ensure they could be exposed to their own historical culture. These were issues important to me everyone should know their history even if it is us who writes our own future. Every one of them wanted to ensure I realized that the child would likely have issues with stereo typing and harassment both from people at school and possible law enforcement.  These are issues they experienced in their own lives and they wanted to ensure I was prepared for it. I was a little disappointed I had hoped we were past all that there is no excuse for that in America. We are supposed to be the melting pot the land of opportunity yet we still cannot get past the color of someones skin.  The case workers ended up deciding this was not the best fit as this area is predominantly white and they thought an area where they could get more of their own culture would be a better fit.. I have to admit I was little upset at that but I also understood it. On a seperate note I think sometimes these workers are so worried about a perfect fit the kids end up in the system much longer then they have to but that is another dragon for another day.  In 2016 Philando Castile was killed just outside of Minneapolis. After his death I realized how much racial profiling contributed to his death. Him and his girlfriend were pulled over because he Looked like a robbery suspect because of his wide nose. Castile was licensed to carry a pistol and even announced to the officer that he had one as he was reaching for his car paperwork Castile was shot 7 times from close range. I also carry in my vehicle and I have been pulled over on occasion (for just cause I might add) I have identified myself as carrying because I did not want any misunderstanding and have never had anywhere close to the situation that Castile had. This is not equal protection under the law. It is also why I refuse to support the NRA now; this was a perfect situation for the NRA to show their value to people of color this guy did not do anything wrong and was shot because he was legally carrying and the silence from the NRA was deafening.  Lastly I want to point out that there is only one unit used in the 14th Amendment: American Citizen. There is no differentiation of gender marital status color sexual orientation or any other term we use to divide ourselves. All American citizens must have equal protection under the law. If we do not fully support section 1 of the 14th Amendment can we really say we believe in the Constitution? We need to support all rights defined by the constitution equally.,political,Facebook
Sunday 28 March 2021  GOP Lawmakers Seek Greater Control  By Anthony Izaguirre  The Associated Press  Partisan takeovers of election boards. Threats to assess fines against county election officials and to overturn results. Even bans on giving water to voters while they stand in line.  In addition to their nationwide efforts to limit access to the ballot Republican lawmakers in some states are moving to gain greater control over the local mechanics of elections from voter registration all the way to certifying results.  The bills which have become law in Georgia and Iowa resurrect elements of former President Donald Trumps extraordinary campaign to subvert his loss when his backers openly floated the notion of having legislatures override the will of the voters and launched legal challenges against measures that made it easier to vote during the pandemic.  Its an overreach of power said Aunna Dennis executive director of the Georgia chapter of the voting advocacy group Common Cause. Theyre definitely trying to do an upheaval of our election system.  In a step widely interpreted as a way to check Georgias Democratic strongholds Republican Gov. Brian Kemp signed a bill Thursday to give the GOP-dominated Legislature greater influence over a state board that regulates elecwell tions and empowers it to remove local election officials deemed to be underperforming.  Other states are moving in similar directions. In Iowa after left-leaning counties sent voters absentee ballot applications in 2020 a recently signed law would bar election workers from sending the forms out unless requested. It threatens to fine officials for violating rules. A South Carolina proposal would give lawmakers new oversight of the members appointed to the currently independent State Election Commission.  In Arizona a Republican proposal that has since died would have allowed the Legislature to overturn election results and appoint its own Electoral College representatives. The Brennan Center for Justice a public policy group that supports expanded voter access tallied more than 250 restrictive proposals in the states many of them intended to roll back voting methods that were expanded because of the pandemic. That includes early and mail voting options both of which were popular among voters who sought to avoid virus transmission at crowded polling places.  Republicans have said the bills are meant to shore up public confidence in elections although members of the GOP have been the leading voices spreading baseless claims that the 2020 election was fraudulent.  There is universal agreement among experts that the election in which Republicans performed in congressional and state legislative races was free of widespread problems.  Georgias new law is among the most consequential for future elections. The measure will allow the Legislature to select the leader of the state election board and make the elected secretary of state a nonvoting member of the panel essentially sidelining the chief election officer who was picked by voters. The board could then remove local election officials and replace them.  This bill is a tragedy for democracy and it is built on the lie of voter fraud Lauren Groh Wargo chief executive of the group Fair Fight Action which advocates for greater voter participation said on a call with reporters. It means that radical right-wing legislators if they dont like how elections are being run in Quitman or Lowndes or Fulton or Dougherty counties they can wholesale replace those election administrators and put folks from the other side of the state in charge.  The new law also forbids local officials from taking financial grants to help run their elections narrows the window in which voters can request an absentee ballot and requires an ID to vote absentee by mail. It limits where ballot drop boxes can be placed and when they can be accessed. Giving food or water to voters waiting in line to cast ballots is forbidden. Georgia confirmed President Joe Bidens victory with three statewide counts of nearly 5 million ballots and there was no evidence of problems. They are tweaking the laws however they can to make it harder and to put up barriers for voters to stumble on Georgia state Sen. Jen Jordan a Democrat from Atlanta said at an event sponsored by the progressive group The NewDEAL.  The GOP also is cracking down on methods that counties used to increase participation and make voting easier during the pandemic. Republicans in Texas which has some of the most stringent election laws in the country are moving to ban curbside voting a method used in the last election by liberal- leaning Harris County which includes Houston.  Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds a Republican this month signed a GOP bill that closes voting sites at 8 p.m. rather than 9 p.m. shortens the window for early voting by nine days imposes new restrictions on mail and absentee voting and threatens civil fines and criminal charges against local officials who depart from state election law or guidance.  This is a total takeover of elections by the state said Linn County Auditor Joel Miller who was sued by the Trump campaign for mailing absentee ballot applications with some information already filled out to registered voters.tHat  Copyright (c) The Denver Post March 28 2021 edition.,political,Facebook

Read my full op-ed on the Administration's plans to pay illegal immigrants $450000:  Prices are rising across the board for American families. A tarnished global reputation after a botched Afghanistan withdrawal. Supply chain issues causing shipping delays and shortages. And a border crisis of epic proportions.  Americans face these mounting crises because of the Biden administrations radical agenda and irresponsible policies that put America last.  I was disturbed but frankly unsurprised to learn that the administration has a plan in the works to pay individuals who tried to enter our country illegally $450000  each. When all is said and done if this plan moves forward the Administration could spend almost $1 billion on these payouts.  That money isnt coming out of thin air  working families in Iowa will be funding this cash prize for those who knowingly violated our laws.  To put this in perspective the average family in Iowa brings home around $78000 a year. The Administration wants to pay individuals who broke our laws more than four times that  that is just plain wrong. Its unfair to Americans who work hard for their money and want to see it spent wisely.  Its offensive to the many immigrants who pursued our nations legal immigration process waited their turn in line and are now living in our country legally  and paying their taxes.  And just think about the message that this would send to those considering trying to subvert our laws and cross our border right now. Currently over 3000 migrants have formed a caravan with the intent of storming our border overwhelming law enforcement on the ground and coming into our country illegally.  The Administrations open border policies are incentivizing this surge of illegal immigration. If this payout plan moves forward it will be a clear message that breaking our immigration laws will not only be tolerated but also be rewarded.  There are no circumstances in which Iowan and American families should fund these payouts to illegal immigrants  but this proposal is even more egregious amid the Biden Administrations self-made border crisis. A crisis they still refuse to acknowledge. For the last four months in a row there have been more migrants apprehended at the border than the entire population of Cedar Rapids Iowa.  But instead of returning to policies that secured our border  building the wall reinstating the Remain in Mexico Policy and ensuring Border Patrol Agents have necessary resources to protect us  the Administration is focused on giving $450000 to some illegal immigrants.  I am ready to get to work on policies that incentivize legal immigration while stopping illegal immigration  including modernizing our visa waiver program and reducing processing backlogs  but we wont be able to have serious conversations about reforming our legal immigration system if this is the type of policy the Administration is intent on prioritizing.  This is the wrong policy at the wrong time and Ill do everything I can to ensure Americans hard-earned money isnt used to reward those who tried to enter our country illegally.,political,Facebook
"Last week there was an attempt at a coup d'tat. Thankfully it failed but sadly there deaths as a result. This act of insurrection of sedition of hate and of treason was incited by hate by vitriol and by blatant lies. And I say blatant because absolutely no evidence was ever produced of their claims. Now my last two posts have addressed this event one because it's historic but also because it was fostered by hate. We have people in our society that rail against things like being ""politically correct."" As if an effort to not offend is sign of weakness. So we hear terms like ""snowflake"" and ""pussy"" as well as others. Hate speech of any kind is not appropriate or acceptable but especially when it incites violence. Often it involves cult like belief in someone and what you believe is a charismatic leader. However sadly it often also involves tag alongs that when it's all said and done? Regret their participation it what occurred. Especially if they have to face legal repercussions as a result. The real culprits of this are the feelings of lack and of losing something you think you're entitled to. We see and continue to see people resist change. Changes like accepting of differences. Differences of race of sexual orientations of religion and even of wealth/class. We have to reach a point in America and in the world where we realize and accept change for what it is. Change is inevitable and a constant in the universe. Embrace it!",political,Facebook
Id like to share some thoughts I didnt think needed to be said until I received a phone call today: My opponents in this race are good people. Bigotry has no place in Overland Park. And we cannot as a city continue the kind of us vs. them or the other side is my enemy BS we see too often in state and national politics.  Today I got a call from a voter who had a few questions before they cast their ballot. I typically love having these conversations. But after this call I can tell you Im damn proud that I will NOT be receiving this persons vote.  The caller started by telling me that all members of one party and most members of another want to destroy America. They asked how I felt about that. I said I disagree with the statement. I shared that I have met all the candidates in this race. I said we might disagree on policy or how to achieve our goals but that my opponents are good people and they can rest assured that no one in this race is out to destroy anything.  They asked about my feelings on affordable housing before cutting me off to tell me it would bring the kinds of people we dont want here. When I tried to learn more about what they meant by that they specifically said they dont want to see more Black people moving in.  After sharing how disgusting and just flat out wrong I found that to be I was told I wouldnt be getting their vote. I was told that I need to think about the city I want my kids to grow up in.  Well Ive thought about it! I want my son and any future kids I have to grow up in a city where this persons views have no place!  As you consider whether youre going to be able to fit time in to go vote this week please remember that the person I talked to on the phone IS voting. Ask yourself do you want their voice to be heard and not yours?,political,Facebook
I saw in the news again yesterday that Americans are increasingly aware that the destruction the virus has wrought in the United States could have been mostly avoided as well as the CDC warning today about a potential fourth wave. So I am reposting this (updated again ) in the hopes that even more people will become aware of the success that has been achieved to date combatting the virus in much of Asia Australia and New Zealand.  Maybe we will eventually learn that the success in this part of the world (I am currently in Thailand) is because of some immunity but the mask wearing temperature taking hand sanitizer using and contact tracing cant hurt and sure seems to be helping a lot. We are free here in Thailand to go to school; to work; to the mall; to restaurants; to the store; to the movies. Life here is ninety five percent normal. The infringement on our freedom from mask wearing and temperature taking is minimal compared to the loss of freedom in the United States let alone all the suffering and death.  Thailand is a middle income country of around seventy million people. There have been ninety-four deaths here from the virus and most days just a few dozen cases which are dealt with proactively both to treat the sick individual and isolate people she or he came into contact with.  The resistance in the United States to masks and other steps routinely taken in countries in Asia to defeat the virus is regarded as insane and shameful to folks here. And the fact that the resistance is framed in terms of Americans' constitutional rights--rights people in much of the rest of the world wish they had--is regarded as a horribly inaccurate framing of our rights.  We are at war with the virus. As of the writing of this updated post the virus has killed more than 549000 Americans in about thirteen months. By contrast 58209 Americans were killed in the Vietnam War between 1961 and 1975. 405399 Americans were killed in World War II in the five years between 1941 and 1945. And any American with a pulse has seen the economic devastation and tearing of our already torn social fabric the virus has wrought.  So it's a war but one that other countries have shown can be managed with relatively minimal sacrifice. But sacrifice means rules that are uniformly applied and enforced. To date America has been like patients who take half of the antibiotic prescribed and then stop or only remember to take it every other day then complain that they aren't better.  Our political leadership needs to look around the world and get with the program. Thailand's death rate from the virus would have translated to about three hundred eighty deaths given the U.S. population of three hundred and thirty million. What the countries that have defeated the virus have done is not rocket science...certainly the country that put men on the moon more than half a century ago can do this.  Please share this widely if you think its worth sharing. Speaking with folks in the United States it is apparent to me that few people there know how much better things have been here.  Be well and thanks for reading.,political,Facebook
Why is Healthcare so Expensive in America? One example CVS Health  Make no mistake healthcare in America is a big business. In 2018 total healthcare costs were $3.65 trillion and rose to $3.8 trillion in 2019. the healthcare costs to GDP percentage remained the same through both years at 17.7%. Multitudes of investment firms invest billions of dollars into healthcare each year because of the profitability. The top 10 Healthcare companies in America had gross revenues ranging from $64.9 to $268.7 billion.  The company that occupies the top slot in top gross revenues may shock you-CVS Health. How did CVS come to occupy that slot? By a series of large acquisitions.  In November of 2006 CVS acquired a large pharmacy benefits manager Caremark for $21billion in stock. A pharmacy manager are middlemen between the drug companies and employees and others with drug benefits coverage. This instantly made CVS Americas leading pharmacy benefits manager.  In June of 2015 CVS Health bought out all the Target Pharmacies for $1.9 billion.  In November of 2018 CVS Health purchased one of the largest insurance companies in America Aetna. The deal cost CVS Health $69 billion.  How have these mergers helped CVS Health? -In 2018 CVS Health had gross revenues of $195 billion. -In 2019 their income rose to $257 Billion the year where they had a year longs income from the merger with Aetna. This was a 32% increase in year over year gross revenues. In 2020 CVS Health became the richest company by gross revenues in America at $269 billion.  Net Revenues have also improved. -In 2018 because of the Aetna acquisition CVS Healths net income was negative-$.059 billion -In 2019 net income rose to $6.634 billion -In 2020 net income rose again despite the COVID-19 pandemic to $7.18 billion an 8.22% increase.  How does CVS Health plan to continue to dominate the healthcare income rankings? Beginning in July of 2019 CVS Health was given federal approval to begin a clinical trial of newly invented in-home dialysis units. This would put it in direct competition with the 2 largest out-patient dialysis treatment centers DaVita Inc. owned by United Health Group and Fresenius Medical Care AG.  Since CVS Health is so profitable how well do they pay their CEO Larry Merlo? According to Wallmine Mr. Merlo is paid $36.452 million a year. His net wealth is $78.6 million as of January 2021. In my nearly completed book on healthcare in the United States I have done an expose on most facets of various medical industries. I then offer solutions as to how to correct abuses and greed. In Europe which averages half the cost of our healthcare as measured by per person per year. Outside of pharmaceutical companies there is stringent regulation of their medical companies.  So now you want to ask me why a drugstore company is allowed to buy a large health insurance company and do in-home dialysis. It is the lack of proper federal regulation. This same story is repeated over and over again by dozens of healthcare companies. The solution? Limit the scope of these mergers and limit the profits with patients ultimately getting charged significantly less for their healthcare.,political,Facebook
Needed: A Shift in Thinking in America  Government spending is out of control.  The American people are growing more dependent on government antithetical to American values and the power of the individual and this is giving tacit approval to the largest spending spree in recorded history with money that is created from debt.  In our heritage we fought for freedom and liberty against the British; freedom from government tyranny and control over our lives but we are now giving up that power more and more and becoming ever increasingly dependent on the government. We need a government to protect our rights and for our defense and to help facilitate economic growth and betterment of peoples lives but we have sailed into deep uncharted waters of spending and debt without any regard to the unpredictable weather conditions and reefs ahead.  We have a debt based monetary system (creation of money through issuing debt I.e. borrowing) in the United States that creates two classes of people those who can create money out of thin air and lend it to everyone else and everyone else who has to borrow the Wizard of Oz money at interest. It is a two tiered system that is completely contrary to our American values embodied in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution and completely contrary to the rule of law.  Income inequality is a symptom of this sick Ponzi scheme of money creation by the Federal Reserve and commercial banking system and not from the earned money free market system.  The American people have to work hard for our money but the Federal Reserve creates money out of thin air and loans it at near 0 % (.05%) to the billionaire class top Wall Street corporations and large commercial banks who then in turn charge the public high interest rates and buy assets like real estate and stock buybacks to pump and dump buying their own stocks at low prices and selling them at high ones making untold billions in profits. Point blank it is hard to call this anything else but a scam..  The house of cards that has been built cannot hold by the sheer weight of debt and fraud in our system. The Federal Reserve and large commercial banks are running our system and they are supported by both political parties because that is where the funding for their campaigns come from and thus their loyalty.  The people have to become more aware of the system as it is and realize that although politicians often have good intent it is undermined by insider money that does not have the publics interest as paramount.  We are moving into a world of more government control surveillance and oversight as in the same system that the Chinese use to control their citizens through the policy: Once discredited forever limited. In other words once a citizen in China is discredited socially and politically speaking he or she is limited in all aspects of daily life I.e. travel freedom of speech (i.e. cancel culture) health and personal monetary decisions etc. etc.  We need the vigor of opposing viewpoints and above all transparency in government especially in monetary matters (auditing of the Federal Reserve). The solution to all of these problems is the spirit of American inquiry freedom of speech rule of law (the Constitution) entrepreneurship (backed by low interest loans) self-sovereignty and above all American creativity.  We can head off the train wreck that is undermining our American system of government corporate control of our monetary and political systems and increasing corporate influence of the press by becoming more aware of whats going on and demand change through the power of the people to take more responsibility for the direction America should take. Our government political leaders the military the press and our monetary and financial institutions must reflect American values and not just give lip service to them for convenience sake.  What we need is a shift in thinking in America that reinvigorates our original identity spirit and values.  There is a solution. It is us.,political,Facebook

John Colby shut up just shut up ! You thought you could make a political settlement with the Taliban to not take over Kabul including the US embassy ! Youre a delusional ignorant fool representing an even higher authority fool named Biden & his pentagon. 20 years in a hostile country & you learnt nothing about the enemy ! If you knew you were leaving why didnt you make preparations to leave without endangering the American embassy staff the other personnel & even soldiers & military ? Now Biden is sending in 3000 marines to  protect  Americans to leave. ! I thought he had askedthe Taliban to please  do not overtake our embassy. You are the spokesperson of the US pentagon? 20 years & this is how you exit a country where young soldiers gave their lives away & America spent over 2 trillion dollars ! Did you think that you had reversed the Talibans ways & beliefs & thinking & turned them Into  peaceful thinking & loving hippies ? The Afghani peaceniks America should be and is the laughing stock of the world ! The degree of incompetence & lack of accountability is shocking. The abandonment of Afghani allies & the defenseless Afghani women is criminal. How callous how careless & indifferent can a US administration be to others & its own people?. While we are at it  Donald Duck  &  Goofy  would have made me feel more secure of the homeland than Alejandro Mayorkas the head of DHS & Antony Blinken The Secretary of State! Perhaps we should send Vice President Kamala Harris to examine the  root causes of the militancy of the Taliban & other Islamic extremists ! It might all turn out to be due to  White Supremacists & America.

MAY 18th PASSAGE OF CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT ON EQUALITY OF RIGHTS REQUIRES FULL EDUCATION FUNDING IMMEDIATELY  Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania because of the race or ethnicity of the individual.  (Harrisburg Pennsylvania)- On May 18 2021 by a 72% margin exceeding 1 million votes Pennsylvania voters adopted a constitutional amendment on equality under the law. In relevant part the constitutional amendment states: Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania because of the race or ethnicity of the individual.  BACKGROUND:  Act 35 of 2016 established the Basic Education Funding Formula Law. Since passage of Act 35 of 2016 the Governor and General Assembly have underfunded 144 school districts to the grand total of $6917581360 .  With 144 school districts getting LESS than what they are supposed to get under the law that means 356 school districts are getting MORE than they are supposed to get under the funding law.  The most severely underfunded school districts educate 80% of Pennsylvanias minority students.  Most of the school districts receiving millions MORE than their allocation within the Basic Education Funding Formula law have a student population that is more than 90% white.  Dozens of state and national reports keep demonstrating Pennsylvania maintains the most racist school funding system in America.  With the May 18th passage of the Constitutional amendment on Equality of Rights the General Assembly and Governor Wolf can no longer deny the rights of students and taxpayers in underfunded schools on account of race or ethnicity.  At the same time more than $7.2 Billion in Federal funds are available to fix this.  Its time for Governor Wolf and the General Assembly to use the FY2021-2022 state budget to bring Equality of Rights to all Pennsylvania students and taxpayers.  ___________________  Kelly Lewis a former member of the Pennsylvania General Assembly is a lawyer writer and businessman living in Monroe County Pennsylvania,political,Facebook
This is a letter from Ken Brasington. We thank him for his thoughtful insight and support...  Tom Spagel has repeatedly praised Mayor Schember as a nice guy on this we can agree. For several years the Mayor has volunteered and supported more than fifty community organizations such as the Barber Institute Safe Harbor St. Martin Center Erie Catholic Foundation Neighborhood Art House Eagles Nest basketball coach and taught summer banking lessons- to name a few. He also served on Erie City Council for five and a half years.  With his stalwart administration the Mayor has provided transparency by establishing the Citizens Response Center developed Mayoral Advisory Councils and launched social media platforms- to name a few.  He and his team have advocated for diversity and inclusion resulting in Eries certification as a Welcoming City from Welcoming America and has increased Erie's score on the Human Rights Campaign's Municipal Equality Index from 34 to 80/100 in two years.  Exceptional progress has been made regarding public safety. There is a 15% decrease in robbery rape assault burglary arson and murder since 2018. Body-worn and dash cameras for police have been delivered. The Strengthening Police and Community Partnership Council was established along with expanding the Police Athletic League implementing a Community Outreach Program (COP) and an increasingly diverse pool of candidates are now taking the police and fire exams.  Most recently Erie has been recognized as one of the top five cities in Pennsylvania for remote workers to reside based on cost of living and quality of life (Sara Kuta 2-25-21).  This administration has been fiscally-prudent and assures us taxpayers there will not be a city tax increase for the next five years. They have been proactively implementing measures that so far have saved us over $158 million. Joe and his team have proactively gone after grants bringing in over $50 million to the city and they have created grant programs to provide much-needed resources to homeowners entrepreneurs and businesses. Joe has drawn from his over 40 years in banking experience and depth of understanding of public policy and implemented these critical fiscal strategies to help our city.  Leadership research tells us that great leaders have two distinct qualities: vision and humility. These are qualities that Joe Schember possesses. Lets keep the positive momentum going and re-elect Joe Schember mayor of the City of Erie.  - Ken Brasington,political,Facebook
2020 NEAR MISS OF THE APOCALYPSE  Last year began the greatest mass casualty event in American history; 540000 dead and counting. It was also the year where noxious vapors of an apocalyptic future escaped the world of fiction nearly suffocating us in real life.  In Steven Kings 1978 novel The Stand a mutated flu virus nearly wipes out humanity. Survivors must choose between two leaders: a 108 year old woman urging them to build a peaceful new society and The Dark Man who revels in violence chaos and cruelty. America narrowly chose human decency over a dark man last November.  The 2004 climate science fiction movie The Day After Tomorrow depicts disruption of the North Atlantic Current causing a deep freeze of the East Coast. It was based on a non-fiction book and climate scientists believe the current is slowing because of dramatic warming in the Arctic. What happened in Texas last month will likely become just the opening act of extreme winter storms punctuating disastrous global warming droughts and floods.  The orange glow of smoke blocking the sun over the entire West Coast last summer looked exactly like the panoramic CGI scenes in Blade Runner. Wildfires now contribute half the annual pollution in the West. No clean air strategy that dismisses the climate crisis has a chance of succeeding.  Written in 1993 The Parable of the Sower envisions America in 2024 collapsed from climate disaster wealth inequality and corporate greed. George Orwells 1984 now seems like a 2020 documentary: daily two-minute hate tweets groupthink enemies of the people our own Ministry of Truth American democracy gasping for air in a government coup by a degenerate political party that incited a violent mob hoping to hang the Vice President.  The ghosts of all these dystopian tales haunted America last year as real threats to our future. They still linger as unwanted sinister guests and they all share a common denominator.  The UN said Humans are making Earth a broken and increasingly unlivable planet through climate change biodiversity loss and pollution. The world must make dramatic changes to society economics and daily life. Deforestation shoves exotic disease-carrying creatures into new contact with humans. Dr. Anthony Fauci says we have entered the pandemic era because contributors to the emergence of the virus persist and will catapult future pandemics into our everyday life. Other dangerous infectious diseases spread by insects and microorganisms -- dengue fever coccidioidomycosis Zika Lyme disease malaria leishmaniasis and many others--will become more prevalent and difficult to eradicate.  The pandemic and the environmental crisis emanate from a broader morality crisis where we have institutionalized not just disregard for the planet and the rest of the biological world but cruelty and disregard for human life. Tens of thousands of indigent immigrants are massing at our southern border many are victims of the climate crisis. They are also victims of our morality crisis where we have added to their suffering tearing families apart and putting their children in cages. We are facing a future where global climate refugees will likely number in the billions including Americans.  Ignoring CDC pleas and warnings of dangerous COVID variants spreading before vaccines establish herd immunity governors in red states are endangering all of us by relaxing mask mandates and opening up prematurely. Its as if all those lost lives mean nothing. America has institutionalized a callous disrespect for human life.  We have allowed ignorance idiocy and disdain for science and expertise to become institutionalized in favor of self-interest idolatry. For millions of Americans empirical facts no longer exist and reality is smothered by greed political agenda and cultural and racial grievances. Rivaling Stalins Russia the inspiration for Orwell we have institutionalized not just extreme opinions but deadly lies and deceit on television and social media.  We must never forget that more than any other country we allowed hundreds of thousands to die from COVID unnecessarily with no loved ones able to comfort or hold a hand surrounded only by the anonymity of heroes in hazmat suits. Many were the victims of indifference of others including many Utahns who so devalued the lives of others that they made refusal to wear a mask a badge of honor.  Twenty twenty doesnt have to be the prelude of a dark future. But the pre-requite to a better future is that we relearn humanitys most essential lessonwe must respect care for and sacrifice for one another. (Brian Moench),political,Facebook
One Nation under God! America lacks ways of the covenant. Law makers be the law breaker Police roam the highways and communities as if they are God. Foreigners that are not familiar with our countries Constitution zeal with their own knowledge and none of our land. Americans are just disobedient some most you can't guide them to save their life's. They are more knowledgeable than our leaders like Civil Rights leader Presidents organizational leader of non- profits for example church leaders Pastors deacons and the Elderly. Citizens than and today as one Nation under God misuse grace & mercy. As the land of the free go off the word of the Holy Bible from the beginning to end. The Nation has not yet to come in most cultures to have interest or understanding of each its own(Life). God has giving us the right to live freely! Making our own choices by the use of his law the ten commandments. While sacrificing pleasure by not doing what we all want. The ways of Jesus is the American law through his father's word. Today the Trinity only ask to follow these commands for all not to lean on our own understanding. Then catechism still plays a hugh part in our Nation. One is who influence you to kill? Answer from most God influence me. Ugh...... Second Who favored you to mislead my creation? Answer from most God favored me to mislead. Think about it! God's word Jesus way!,political,Facebook
Systemic racism is the popular theme spewed out by the left and the cancel culture in our country. And people blindly believe it because if the media says so it must be true.  The true reality which is not spun by the media since they like to provide alternate reality is human beings of all colors and races and nationalities are subject to being racists. Racism is color blind. It can be in every human being on the planet. It is hateful and mean. It can be to protect ones boundaries based on fears and phobias and ignorance.  Racism is an action that is not inherent to white people. Racism is not exclusive. Our government and the founding documents are examples of a discriminating society in the 18TH CENTURY. And it wasn't just based on race. It was religion. It was culture. It was superiority complexes. It was basic human ignorance. And today we are not the same people who founded our country. But the principles of democracy in a Republic form of government is our foundation today. And that foundation is not broken.  Today in the 21st century we have almost overcome many of these 18TH CENTURY weaknesses and live in an enlightened society. Yes I said it. ENLIGHTENED SOCIETY! We are more open today to different genders sexualities races cultures ideas and religious beliefs than ever before in recorded history.  Yet those who have this inane belief that everything must be fair and equal have missed out in an important point of being an enlightened society. We are all very different. And those differences make us unique. They are not differences that make one superior over the other. Rather they are all qualities that humans should respect and embrace.  Hate wins when we challenge the notion that we are all unique in Gods eyes. Because hate wants us to fight with one another. Hate comes from a place of fear prejudice and insecurities. It plays to human weaknesses and ignorance.  In order to love one another you should embrace their uniqueness. Embrace the qualities they bring to our lives our nation our society and to our world. And if you don't agree with people you should respect their opinion but not be hateful towards them.  Only that way will America get out of this current dilemma we are in.,political,Facebook
Newton Needs Common Sense Leadership!  We residents have waited patiently hoping you would lead us in the right direction.  Our schools are slipping our police and fire demoralized crime is on the raise. Water bills are out of control city infrastructure is crumbling and bias is rampant in Newton City Government.  Where is our city council leadership - they are supposed to be the voters voice!  The reopening of our schools after covid was an utter disgrace; every other community around us did a better job than Newton - we failed our kids!  Newton once had the highest ranked schools in the state; where are we now?  Newton was once ranked the safest cities in America; now we cant even be found on the list. We are rapidly slipping becoming unsafe.  Our police department is demoralized; what city leader stood strongly beside our police when they were attacked by a Defund the Police mob right next to the police station?  Former Newton Police Chief Howard Mintz emailed the city council on 2/4/2021 saying The following is one of the reasons why the relationship between the police department and the city council is strained regarding Ward 5 City Councilor Bill Humphreys posts: ACAB 1312  All Cops Are Bastards. What has the Current City Council Leadership done about it?  Ask any Newton Police Officer: who in the city leadership has stepped in to support them as they were being vilified?  We ask our Newton Firefighters to run into burning buildings to save our families when we need help; ask them who in leadership has their back?  Roads and infrastructure just take a drive around the city. Its bad really bad. Why cant we do a better job instead of just band aids?  Our Water Bills are out of control; why cant we get accurate readings for our water usage anymore?  Why is Newton leaking and wasting more water than all the communities arounds us? The go-to excuse that our infrastructure is old - doesnt fly. Every community around us has aging infrastructure; Newton should not be the worst Newton should be leading the way on this issue. Invest now to protect the environment save our most precious natural resource: Water.  All claim to be for diversity and inclusion; yet this past week there were more offensive comments and actions at city hall. With the opportunity to lead and address intolerance at Newton City Hall there should have been outrage from all our leaders (not just Brenda Noel) instead they sat silent  their silence is being complicit.  City Council leadership have done too little too late for too long.

I served as an infantry soldier in Iraq not Afghanistan but the events of the past 2 weeks have brought to mind a great many thoughts. So to share just a few:  1. Like a great many other veterans Ive generally supported drawing down our presence in Afghanistan. But that was predicated on the assumption that (a) we would certainly give the Afghani army and government every opportunity to defend themselves (b) that we would offer sanctuary to every Afghani who has worked with us and obviously that (c) we would bring every American home safely before withdrawing the military. It is a shameful embarrassment that President Biden failed to do any of the 3.  2. Most of the toughest memories I have from Iraq involve kids. The footage of kids being lifted over the wall as parents willingly give them up to protect them is gut-wrenching.  3. The military is incredibly effective at large-scale offensive operations. For example the entirety of Iraq was taken under our control in 19 days. We could certainly take back control of enough of Kabul and/or Bagram Air Base to enable us to rescue the *thousands* of Americans now behind enemy lines. Its just a matter of will - unfortunately I dont believe President Biden has any.  4. When I came home and the Iraq War was going poorly afterwards some people asked me Was it worth it? Veterans have a wide range of opinion on this but I can only speak for myself. I personally believed in the mission I was on but deep down I stepped forward to serve because its what my country asked of me at the time. Every single war America has ever fought has at one time or another been controversial. We will always question Was it worth it? and people will always come to different conclusions. And so I encourage veterans not to view your service through the lens of politics and what one president or general later does or does not do. What matters is that you stepped up to serve when called and the manner in which you served once you arrived. Thats all you can control - and that is enough.,political,Facebook

I am Aaron Arguijo and I am a Hispanic running for the United States Senate to represent my state of Texas as a Democratic Candidate. I am a veteran who served our country during the time of war and was one of the first to respond to the attacks on 9/11. I have lived a quiet and peaceful life raising my family since my separation from the military but I feel it is my duty to return to public service. There are many reasons why I have decided to run for this office but the most notable would be the recent catastrophe that Texas suffered and lives were lost. Texans were left to fend for themselves and our current leadership was completely absent with one of them thinking it was okay to go on vacation. Texas deserves better and we cannot forget the permanent damage that has been inflicted on the people of Texas especially to those who lost loved ones.  The people of Texas feel forgotten. There has been a disconnect between voters and its elected officials for years now. As I make my way through Texas speaking with eligible voters and non-eligible voters alike it is apparent that the people do not matter to our current elected Governor and U.S. Senators. It is easier for our leaders to throw money taken in by their ultra rich donors (not their own money) and run ads disparaging any candidate. This has always been their tactic. You can see it in their supporters too and how they interact with honest hardworking legitimate voters who care about Texas. I refuse to believe that it is all about money and not about people. Our Republican counterparts enjoy calling out corporations about cancel culture when they themselves have turned Texas and our country into a giant money grabbing corporation. They themselves have canceled every culture who shares even the slightest contrast of their ideas about what America and Texas should be.  Texas is one of the most diverse states in the United States with Houston being the most diverse city in America. We cannot have one tiny little group of people decide the direction of our state just because they have the money to throw at their politicians. This doesnt do or help hard working Texans who can barely make ends meet. It doesnt do anything for middle class Texans who are one layoff away from losing their lifestyle. Its time for a change in Texas and its time to let someone work for the people who has the best interest of the people at heart. Join me on this fight to take back Texas from greedy politicians and restore it back to the its rightful heirs the people.,political,Facebook

Air Force Gen. Glen D. VanHerck Commander of NORAD and U.S. Northern Command today during a press conference on Afghan evacuees: I would venture - Im speculating a little bit- that the vast majority are not SIVs at this time. They are asylum seekers that will be determined how were going to work them through the process by DHS as the lead federal agency.  Hundreds of Afghan Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) holders who supported Americas military mission were left behind along with an unknown sum of Americans. Many were abandoned at the Kabul airport gates by President Biden and Secretary Blinken and now theyve admitted that a vast majority of the people they brought to the United States were neither American citizen nor SIVs.  President Biden and Secretary Blinken described the evacuation as a success. Either they made a horrible mistake or this was intentional.  We will continue to do everything we can to get Americans and SIVs out of Afghanistan. Our people deserve better and America deserves the truth.,political,Facebook

As Oregons current governor has neglected to issue this statement as Oregons next please allow me.  First: Thank you to our military men and women who were boots-on-the-ground in Afghanistan for your service and everything you sacrificed these past two decades. Im sorry your Commander in Chief let you down. Your efforts deserved a more dignified end.  Second: Whether or not we belonged in Afghanistan is a different discussion but the fact is - we were there. As such there was a right way and a wrong way to exit and President Biden you chose the wrong way. You placed our military and civilians in great danger. You left our Afghan allies to be slaughtered. You ensured their women would lose what few rights they had. You left our own weaponry behind to be used against us. You allowed thousands of imprisoned terrorists back out onto the streets.  My formal education is in the international relations arena so my mind automatically goes to the domino effect you have created. You have weakened the worlds perception of America which emboldens our enemies. If I had to bet right now China is looking toward Taiwan as a means of verifying your weakness.  But go ahead.

"Regarding The Reparations Hustlers  By Kevin L. Brown  In the war being waged to secure racial and social justice in the fight for racial reparations what do we do about the ""Reparations Hustlers""? Reparations Hustlers are individuals or organizations seeking to obtain personal financial gain by securing consulting contracts to render services that give cover to cities and municipalities claiming to offer racial reparations by renaming ordinary government social equity programs reparations. An example of this is what occurred in the City of Evanston in Illinois.  The city government of Evanston created an international buzz by proclaiming that it would provide reparations in the form of a housing grant program to Black residents it discriminated against between 1919 and 1969. Funds to support the reparations grant would come from a city tax on marijuana. The city proclaimed that 3% of the tax would be set aside to create a 10 million dollar fund over 10 years for the purpose of reparations. Some called it a nobel symbolic gesture given that there are 12000 Black people in the city.  The initiative was supported by a little know group called The National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America (NCOBRA) that most Black Americans or anyone else know little about. Having found political footing in Evanston the group pushed with the aid of a political operative to validate the transformation of an ordinary social equity housing program into reparations. And unknown to international and national media was an apparent agenda of personal financial profit by those behind the reparations legislation. It has been reported that there are now efforts by these people to arrange consulting contracts with cities and municipalities to create and rename these social equity programs.  It has also been reported that the first $400000 of the Evanston fund will be dedicated to the housing program. Eligible residents will have the opportunity to submit an application to acquire a $25000 grant that could be applied to a housing loan application a home improvement loan application or the funds could be used to pay down an existing home mortgage. A closer look at the numbers reveals that just 16 individuals of the 12000 Black residents could benefit. Attempting to label such a program as repair or restorative is complicated to say the least. A Facebook or LinkedIn post isn't the right venue to layout the many reasons why such a program does not qualify as racial reparations.  What can be questioned however are the consulting contracts being pursued by individuals seeking to work with cities and municipalities to rename social equity programs and spread this erroneous example of reparations. This desire for personal profit by a few at the expense of legitimate historical anti-Black racism/white supremacy harms is in my opinion unconscionable.  Today there is a fierce momentum to correct the historical injustices against the American descendants of slavery. The creation of this Reparations Hustle threatens the legitimate movement toward repair and redress. We all have a responsibility to educate ourselves and our community regarding the truth about what is happening and to inform others about individuals who would undermine the efforts to secure authentic repair for Black people.",political,Facebook
Starting tomorrow Midlothian Texas will begin early voting for May 1st special election. This election will include replacing the late Congressman Ron Wright in the US Congress for the Texas 6th District as well as local bond elections city council positions and school board positions. I have briefly researched the 23 congressional candidates and have narrowed down to five that I would consider endorsing. This page is dedicated to creating a centrists political party that primarily wants to eliminate federal deficit spending and eventually pay down our national debt as well as develop compromises to solve our problems by forcing the two predominant parties to work together. For the sake of fairness I have selected two Republicans and two Democrats that I like as well as the one Libertarian. Here are my thoughts on the candidates. Republicans Michael Wood calls himself a conservative Republican and does not seem to be a centrist but there are things I really like about him. He is a Purple Heart veteran and I admire him for that. He states his goal is to repair the Republican Party from the damage Donald Trump has inflicted upon it and restore it to a respected party. This alone shows he has great courage and wants to separate himself from the far right. John Anthony Castro does not call himself a centrists but is a fiscal conservative. He also has innovative ideas for solving some of Americas problems. Democrats Patrick Moses is retired from a 32 year career in Federal Law Enforcement. He has stated his desire to reach across the aisle so this gives him centrist creeds. Jana Lynn Sanchez does not state any centrists ideals but she grew up and lives in the area. Her position on issues are typical Democrat positions but does not seem to carry socialist values. Libertarian Phil Gray has a plan to help pay down the debt through immigration reform similar to some Independence Party plans. I do like Libertarian ideas on reforming drug laws but I do have a problem with a lot of Libertarians wanting to pull back American influence from around the world.  I did not research the city council and school board candidates so I will not comment on those races. I do have an opinion on the bond elections though. Midlothian City services do seem to have outgrown the current City Hall so I endorse the bonds for a new facility that includes a city library. As an avid lap swimmer I also endorse building a rec center with indoor and outdoor pools. I am not sure about contracting the YMCA to operate it though. Are we taxpayers paying to build a YMCA facility? I once used YMCA pools for lap swimming until they forced adult swimmers into a single lane to make room for profitable swim lessons for children. I endorse the bond proposal for new roads also. I cannot endorse the bond proposal for a new police station. This has nothing to do with the defund police movement. In my day job I visit police facilities for a number of city departments in various sized cities. I once worked in the Midlothian police station and remember thinking that it was rather large for a city this size. I know our city is growing and the department may eventually outgrow the current facility but I think it has room for growth inside its current facility with some possible remodeling. One amenity this city does not seem to be investing in is parks. I have been recently working in Flour Mound and was impressed by all of the green space there. There is quite a bit of wooded land in Midlothian I think the city should be trying to acquire for future parks. Many cities in North Texas have beautiful parks and trails and parkland is considered high when ranking a citys quality of life and I would hate to see Midlothian not keep up with our neighbors.,political,Facebook
Less than 48 hours ago some 2800 voters went to the polls to make their voices heard and from my point of view that's nothing short of wonderful.  Where I grew up the opportunity to directly have a hand in shaping government was not always assured. So I cherish that right here in America and this beautiful town of Killingworth where my wife Cassandra and I are raising our family and running a local business.  Nancy Gorski will soon be sworn into office as our new First Selectman; she and the others who were elected to office Tuesday night have my heartfelt congratulations and my wholehearted support.  For the next two years our town will be led by a mix of highly experienced people alongside some new people with fresh ideas. This is nothing but good for all of us as we look to the future.  It also needs to be said that those who offered their time and talent to the betterment of our town but were not elected likewise deserve our entire town's gratitude and thanks for stepping forward. After all that is citizenship at its finest and is the bedrock of American democracy.  We continue to be blessed in this town with a spirit of volunteerism that not only survives but thrives. I look forward to doing my part by serving on the Board of Assessment Appeals. And I continue to be immensely proud to call Killingworth my adopted home.  Francesco,political,Facebook
Voter suppression is not a democratic endeavor!  Unfortunately GOP controlled states are trying or have passed new laws to that end since the 2020 election.  So the Senate's minority rule feature the fillbuster must be swept from the high chamber to restore simple majority voting to allow passage of this legislation.  The right-wingers will say that they are protecting the vote. NO! What they seek in essence is to restrict voting rights by making voting unnecessarily difficult.  By this design they intend to retain power contrary to democratic principles. DA2020s (Share if you agree!)  //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////  Trumps false narrative about election fraud has prompted lawmakers in 43 states to file bills to limit ballot access.  US voting rights  Landmark US bill to stop voter suppression passes first hurdle in House Voting legislation which also targets gerrymandering and campaign finance needs 60 votes in Senate to become law  Associated Press  Thu 4 Mar 2021 01.18 EST  House Democrats have passed sweeping voting and ethics legislation over unanimous Republican opposition advancing to the Senate what would be the largest overhaul of the US election law in at least a generation.  House Resolution 1 which touches on virtually every aspect of the electoral process was approved 220-210. It would restrict partisan gerrymandering of congressional districts strike down hurdles to voting and bring transparency to a murky campaign finance system that allows wealthy donors to anonymously bankroll political causes.  The bill would be one of the largest expansions of the right to vote in America since the passage of the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act. It requires states to offer early voting as well as same-day automatic and online voter registration. It mandates that states allow anyone to vote by mail if they wish (16 states currently require an excuse) and would impose new limits on how states can remove people from the voter rolls also sometimes referred to as voter purging.  The bill also would limit the manipulation of the physical boundaries electoral districts for partisan gain or gerrymandering a process Republicans used at unprecedented levels a decade ago. States would have to follow fairness criteria when drawing districts require states to set up independent commissions to the lines.  The right to vote is sacred and fundamental  it is the right from which all of our other rights as Americans spring. This landmark legislation is urgently needed to protect that right to safeguard the integrity of our elections and to repair and strengthen our democracy Joe Biden said in a statement on Thursday morning.  The bill is a powerful counterweight to voting rights restrictions advancing in Republican-controlled statehouses across the country in the wake of Donald Trumps repeated false claims of a stolen 2020 election. Yet it faces an uncertain fate in the Democratic-controlled Senate where it has little chance of passing without changes to procedural rules that now allow Republicans to block it.  That rule the filibuster requires 60 votes for legislation to advance. Because Democrats are unlikely to find 10 Republican senators to sign on to the bill there are loud calls to get rid of the rule. But not all Democrats in the senate support ending the filibuster. The fight over whether to keep the rule looms as a major one for the Democrats in the senate; calls to eliminate the filibuster have only grown louder with the sweeping voting restrictions Republicans are passing across the country.  The stakes in the outcome are huge cutting to the foundational idea that one person equals one vote and carrying with it the potential to shape election outcomes for years to come. It also offers a test of how hard President Joe Biden and his party are willing to fight for their priorities as well as those of their voters.  US House passes most ambitious police reform effort in decades This bill will put a stop at the voter suppression that were seeing debated right now said Nikema Williams a new congresswoman who represents the Georgia district that deceased voting rights champion John Lewis held for years. This bill is the Good Trouble he fought for his entire life.  To Republicans however it would give license to unwanted federal interference in states authority to conduct their own elections  ultimately benefiting Democrats through higher turnout most notably among minorities.  Democrats want to use their razor-thin majority not to pass bills to earn voters trust but to ensure they dont lose more seats in the next election House minority leader Kevin McCarthy said from the House floor on Tuesday.  The measure has been a priority for Democrats since they won their House majority in 2018. But it has taken on added urgency in the wake of Trumps false claims which incited the deadly storming of the US Capitol in January.  Courts and even Trumps last attorney general William Barr found his claims about the election to be without merit. But spurred on by those lies state lawmakers across the US have filed more than 200 bills in 43 states that would limit ballot access according to a tally kept by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University.  Trump's fraud claims undermine democracy ex-US election security chief says In Iowa the legislature voted to cut absentee and in-person early voting while preventing local elections officials from setting up additional locations to make early voting easier. In Georgia the House on Monday voted for legislation requiring identification to vote by mail that would also allow counties to cancel early in-person voting on Sundays when many Black voters cast ballots after church.  On Tuesday the supreme court appeared ready to uphold voting restrictions in Arizona which could make it harder to challenge state election laws in the future.  When asked why proponents sought to uphold the Arizona laws which limit who can turn in absentee ballots and enable ballots to be thrown out if they are cast in the wrong precinct a lawyer for the states Republican party said: Because it puts us at a competitive disadvantage relative to Democrats said attorney Michael Carvin.

Anatomy of the Wisconsin disaster and what can be learned from the failure  You might have already read about the tragic sequence of events that lead to the bloodbath in Wisconsin that happened this week. So here is the summary. As you might have already guessed it is the extractive industry that is at the heart of the American War On Wolves. It is Big Oil that finances hunting advocacies that help local state wolf haters hunters and ranchers to succeed in courts when it seems to be nearly impossible. That is precisely what happened in the Wisconsin tragedy. So here is a trace diagram of the Wisconsin disaster and an illustration of a food chain:  Koch Brothers -> Hunter Nation Inc. (a Kansas based hunting advocacy group) -> Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty (a law firm) -> Judge Bennett Brantmeier Jefferson County Circuit Court -> Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) -> hunters  Often we only see those who commit atrocities. But these people are often just opportunists a low influence minority of wolf hating sadists with extremely low intelligence and zero knowledge of biology. However they are backed by people who have a global agenda - removal of wildlife protection laws and ultimately - getting access to oil mining fields. These forces have virtually unlimited pocket size when it comes to financing campaigns to stop any legal obstacles to hunting. That was exactly what has happened in Wisconsin:  1) Koch financed Hunter Nation Inc. a Kansas-based hunting advocacy group  2) The conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty brought the lawsuit against the state of Wisconsin on behalf of Hunter Nation Inc.  3) Jefferson County Circuit Court judge Bennett Brantmeier ruled that Wisconsin DNR must hold a wolf hunt for the final week of February since wolves are off the endangered species list. The judge gave the DNR only a few days to set quotas and set up a system on its website for people to be able to immediately buy hunting tags.  4) The state DNR  which had not wanted to start a hunt until November as state law dictates appealed this order.  5) Since the lower court (possibly intentionally?) did not take all steps to make its order final the appellate court had no jurisdiction to rule on the matter and so denied the appeal on Feb. 19.  6) On Monday Feb. 22 the slaughter started. The hunt was to last through Feb. 28 but within 2  days had already far exceeded the quotas set for all 6 hunting units which were then shut down.  So we see that the events followed a very well thought plot. Including the trick with the lower court. Kochs money worked out all the way and we have lost our precious wolves 20% of the Wisconsins wolf population in less than 3 days. This is what the press said:  Wisconsin law required there to be a wolf hunting season from early November through the end of February if the wolf is not on the endangered or threatened species list. It was removed from the federal endangered species list on Jan. 4.  The Wisconsin DNR board refused at a Jan. 22 meeting to start a hunt before November of this year but the judge last week ordered that the hunt be implemented this month. (In their request of the DNR board to hold the Jan 22 meeting - True Wolf) Republican state lawmakers raised concerns that President Joe Biden might restore protections for the wolves before November.  So yes it was a very well thought combination of preemptive measures to make sure new administration could not prevent the slaughter. What can be done now to stop developing of such strategies into a chain reaction and moving to Idaho Montana Wyoming Michigan etc.? Answer to this question would give us a key for saving our wolves from the carnage that is so much dreamt of by the extractive industry and its field workers- wolf killing enthusiasts of the rural America.,political,Facebook
"Dumb Joe Biden quote from a speech on May 28 regarding Chinese aspirations......  ""America is unique. Of all the nations in the world we are the only nation organized based on an idea.""  Umm.... Our ideology which is based on an idea is not unique.  Our country was not based on an idea but on a political concept based on history. A Republic our form of government was not unique to the USA. Freedom from Great Britain was not an idea but a result of financial abuse by its colonial masters.  Marxist ideology is based on an idea written by Karl Marx. National Socialism was based on an idea written by Adolph Hitler.  So Biden was trying to illustrate how we are different than China. Chinese nationalism was born out of their country being held by many colonial masters along its coast line. Its roots in rebellion was the Boxer Rebellion in the early 20th century. Nationalism grew under Chiang Kai-shek and the Koumintang. A counter movement under Mao Tse Tung with Marxism as a basis for revolution evolved around the same time. Both sides were grown out of an idea or ideology. One prevailed and took China over. One fled to Taiwan.  So Uncle Joe is either ill informed or just saying stupid stuff for an audience of minions. Either way Xi Jinping has stated he will own the USA by 2035 based on HIS idea and ideology. And he aspires to that end and the USA better be ready for the eventual conflict with China!",political,Facebook

I was recently asked when or where did I think this country started to go wrong. I did not really have an answer then but I think I do now. It is when we started to decide we wanted to select our rulers instead of our representatives. When we started to care more about what side ruled us then electing people who shared our values and would represent us. I am not sure exactly when it happened but at some point people started becoming republicans and democrats before Americans. America is not perfect we have our warts and our mistakes though history some we are yet to truly own but I still love her and will always put her first.  What scares me now is that from the time I was a small child I never had a doubt that if our country was attacked we would unite under one flag to defend her. Right now I do not know if it is true anymore. That scares me. We need to end this tribalism this identity politics game before it tears this country apart.  Thanks as always for reading.

A copy of the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights hang in the waiting room of my office. All attorneys seeking admission to the New Jersey State Bar must sign an oath to support the Constitution of the United States and the State of New Jersey. As one of the original 13 colonies New Jersey representatives signed the Declaration which was adopted on July 4th 1776 and reads as follows:  When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights that among these are Life Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.  That to secure these rights Governments are instituted among Men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed  That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it and to institute new Government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to affect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence indeed will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such Government and to provide new Guards for their future security.  Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. . . .  The Declaration than goes on to list the grievances suffered by the colonies at the hands of the King of England which drove them to seek independence. The signers pledged their lives fortunes and Sacred Honor to support the Declaration relying on the protection of Divine Providence.  Why did the founders use the term all men are created equal given that slavery was legal in the colonies as it has been throughout the world during various stages of history? Racial activists such as Nikole Hannah-Jones and Ibram X. Kendi contend that the white men who drafted the Declaration did not believe their own words and that America was built on a lie. What they fail to recognize is that the founders established equality and freedom as pillars for the country to strive towards in signing the Declaration. These white men maligned by Jones and Kendi risked being charged with treason for which the penalty was death to establish an independent nation founded on the very principles which led to the abolition of slavery.  From the settlement of the first colony America has been a beacon of hope initially for Pilgrims who sought to escape religious persecution to the present day in which immigrants flock here to seek economic opportunity. Thomas Jefferson denounced slavery in the original draft of the Declaration of Independence indicating that it was a morally repugnant practice brought to the new world by King George. The text regarding slavery was removed to gain the approval of the southern colonies without which the United States would never have been formed. However Jeffersons use of the phrase all men are created equal served as a powerful springboard to ultimately abolishing human bondage in this country.  Like the human beings which inhabit it America is imperfect struggling to reach its goals sometimes succeeding occasionally failing but always striving to be better. Approximately three-quarters of a million Americans died in a Civil War less than 100 years after signing of the Declaration of Independence to end the horror of slavery. After the Civil War African Americans continued to suffer from oppression particularly in the then Democrat-controlled South under Jim Crow laws which segregated the races and enshrined discrimination. Progress could not be stopped though. Whites and blacks served together in the military fighting two World Wars. They marched and bled together in the 1960s to force the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The aptly named Supreme Court decision of Loving vs. Virginia was issued in 1967 striking down state laws which banned interracial marriages. The 1970s marked the start of the post-civil rights movement era during which African Americans made great strides in academia business and politics. In 1983 Martin Luther King Day was declared the first new federal holiday since the 1940s by President Reagan. During his tenure from 1993 - 2001 President Clinton focused on issues of equality and issued an apology to the families of 399 black men impacted by the Tuskegee syphilis experiment in which the public health service failed to inform them of their diagnosis or provide them with treatment for syphilis to study the long-term effects of the disease. President George W. Bush appointed more people of color to top-tier cabinet roles than any other president naming General Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice to lead the State Department among other cabinet members. Americans of all races creeds and colors came together in solidarity after the tragedy of 9-11. In 2008 we elected our first black President Barack Obama who was re-elected to a second term in 2012. In 2018 President Trump signed a prison reform law which had been lobbied for by civil rights leaders for years. One year later President Trump pledged that the federal government would permanently provide funding of more than $250 million annually to the nations historically black universities. In short our county has made incredible progress towards the goal of upholding equality and liberty for all.  Opportunists such as Jones and Kendi ignore the enormous advancements made in race relations over the past 150 years and seek to demonize America in the present day for long-ago outlawed crimes against humanity. According to the Center for Global Justice there are as many as forty million people still living in various forms of bondage today including domestic servitude forced labor child labor debt bondage forced marriage human trafficking and descent-based slavery in other parts of the world. Yet it is only America which continues to be labeled by some as systemically racist.  Why focus on America when the evil of slavery still exists in the world? Because the United States is a shining example of the success of capitalism which has raised more people out of abject poverty than any other political or economic system. Given the high standards of living in the United States Americans have never developed a strong sense of class consciousness. Most citizens believe in the American dream: that one can transcend their origins through hard work. It was thus difficult for Marxist intellectuals to agitate for a workers revolution here. Now neo-Marxists are taking another crack at it by implementing critical theories which uses several intersectional groups rather than economic class as a method of dividing citizens for the purpose of deconstructing classical liberal Western institutions and replacing them with an atheist Marxist value system.  Critical race theory known as CRT is an insidious legal hypothesis which has been festering and growing in our universities since the early 1980s. It instructs people to view the world entirely through a lens of race. Under CRT it is unacceptable to be color-blind  the most important characteristic of an individual is their skin color under this theory and individuals are seen as members of either the oppressed or oppressor class. It also suggests that people of color lack agency to forge their own destiny cruelly undermining their confidence by labeling them as perpetual victims.  The adherents of CRT do not hide their true goal. One of the promoters of this mindset Ibram X. Kendi openly states In order to truly be antiracist you also have to truly be anti-capitalist. The aim of CRT not simply to teach a complete and accurate history of the injustices which occurred in the United States. Rather the goal is to divide us as a country to facilitate the tearing down our core institutions including capitalism to create an unattainable utopian vision of absolute equity.  CRT is not the only critical theory gaining in popularity  it is part of the larger Critical Social Justice movement which divides society into different groups based upon race gender ethnicity sexual preference and disability. According to Critical Social Justice straight white people (men in particular) are oppressors who must be shunned. Purveyors of the critical theories believe in the collective guilt of all members of the supposed oppressor class regardless of their individual innocence and encourage separate spaces for people of color. In other words these theories make generalizations based upon immutable characteristics  exactly the type of discrimination the civil rights movement sought to stamp out. Such segregation and collective guilt violate the basic principles of justice and equality enshrined in the Constitution and undermines our strength as one nation.  It is undeniable that there are still ignorant people in the world who are racists sexists and homophobic. Such discrimination was outlawed long ago and we must continue to fight against it wherever it rears its ugly head. Civil rights attorneys around the country are prepared to file lawsuits against on behalf of victims and to overturn any laws or policies which discriminate based on an immutable characteristic. However doing battle against specific instances of injustice is a far different proposition than dividing all of society by hierarchies of intersectional groups for the purpose of tearing down our institutions.  The Critical Social Justice movement uses the buzz word equity in the curriculum it has been pushing on corporations and educational institutions. The term seems to be an innocuous and even laudable goal for society. However it requires a deeper analysis to understand why it is not. The American founding fathers specifically used the term equality rather than equity in the Declaration and Constitution. While the words sound similar their meanings are very different. Equality under the law refers to the protection of the rights of the individual. By contrast those who seek equity are concerned with collective groups of people and believe that justice is only achieved when every group has attained the same outcome as opposed to being provided the same opportunity. Regardless of their skin color religion gender or sexual orientation all individuals have unique skill sets intelligence levels natural talents upbringings social financial advantages/disadvantages and aspirations. Absolute equity of outcome is thus virtually impossible to track. It is even harder to achieve.  Since absolute equity can never occur naturally it may only be attained by sheer force  taking from one individual and giving it to another. It is therefore the antithesis of the traditional American notion of equality and freedom -- and will necessarily result in totalitarianism. The Marxist goal of equity attributes malice to all members of the supposed oppressor class with or without evidence and requires active discrimination based on skin color and/or sexual orientation to alleviate unproven discrimination. Massive government power would thus be necessary to achieve equity through race-based redistribution of wealth active discrimination suppression of free speech of those who disagree and omnipotent bureaucratic authority to carry it out.  The American experiment started with the principal that all men were endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights meaning that our rights emanate from God by virtue of our membership in the human race. Our rights to life liberty and happiness are thus not granted by any government. In Federalist paper no. 51 James Madison pointed out that if men were angels no government would be necessary. Since the potential for evil runs through every human heart it is necessary to establish law administered by government to protect citizens from one another and secure our rights. However we must always guard against the government gaining too much power especially in the hands of unelected bureaucrats who are not accountable to the people. If those who believe in the Marxist goal of equity continue to accrue power in our government I fear that citizens who believe in individual rights and responsibilities will seek to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their security. Let us hope that this drastic step is unnecessary so that America may continue being that bright shining city on the hill providing freedom and prosperity to all.

Liz Cheney is possibly the bravest politician in America. She is sacrificing her powerful leadership position to stand up for what is right in denouncing the Big Lie that Trump really won the election. The fact that 70% of the voters in her party believe that lie makes it obvious her party no longer stands for the same values as she does. It is time politicians in the middle separate from the Republicans and Democrats to form a centrist party. Mitt Romney Joe Manchin and many more elected officials could create a strong third party. To the naysayers that say a third party can never make it I have a history lesson for you. In 1860 the US elected a president from a third party founded just 6 years earlier. That party was the Republican Party and that president was Abraham Lincoln.,political,Facebook

"Over the past few months President Biden continues to push America towards an authoritarian state. He recently announced a proposal that financial institutions report transactional activity for any bank account that has an inflow outflow or aggregate amount totaling $600 in a year.  This bar for monitoring is so low that most citizens on unemployment social security benefits and Medicare would have every financial transaction monitored.  To bring it to a more personal level if your child takes a summer job mowing lawns and opens a savings account for that funding then he or she would likely be monitored as well.  While the stated goal of this vast data collection is to uncover tax dodging by the wealthy this proposal is not remotely targeted to that purpose or population.  Last time we checked the median household here in Idaho is roughly $61000 a year. Nearly every Idahoan family would be on that list from monitoring as one of the ""rich"" paying their share.  The false pretense of closing the tax-gap would give unprecedented data collection authority to the federal government with limited return on investment for citizens.  It is also unclear how the IRS will use this data to accomplish its goal.  Further the federal governments history of keeping this type of data secure is dubious at best. The IRS is one of several government systems that has recently experienced a data breach and financial institutions across the country are highly concerned about the governments ability to keep personal financial data secure.  Lets be real this is an unprecedented invasion of privacy masquerading as an effort to reduce the tax gap.  This is not acceptable and Congress must act.",political,Facebook

Endorsement from Joe Hammer.  Joe Hammer is a friend to all of us in Holmdel. His steady hand lends balance and thoughtfulness to the Holmdel Board of Education. A great family man and retired United States Air Force officer Joe knows what it takes to serve the HOLMDEL community with distinction and with our appreciation and respect to protect our freedoms in our beautiful United States of America. Thank you Joe for your kind endorsement!  Endorsement Below  October 25 2021  Dear Friends and Holmdel Voters  I am encouraging you to vote for Terence Wall for Board of Education on Nov 2 2021. Terence is a hardworking and dedicated member of the Board. From the first day that he became a member he has always advocated the parents children and taxpayers of Holmdel. He is one of the strongest voices on the board for those who dont often have a voice. His attention to detail thoughtful ideas and fiscal prudence is exactly what is needed.  Here are a few examples of what Terence has forcefully advocated for:  Re-Opening of the schools FULL TIME last fall  First district in the state!  Promoted full day kindergarten and expanded pre-school as well  First tax levy cut in over a decade  However what you may not see is how he has always put Holmdels parents and children as his highest priority. On the Personnel and Negotiations Committee his attention to contract details and experience in negotiating with unions has been outstanding. He raised the issue of high future costs of the new healthcare plans which no one had observed. He worked closely with the administration and teachers to ensure that they were delivering the best education to our students. He holds everyone accountable for their actions and not only tells the truth but advocates for it.  Terence is tough honest and focused on taxpayers teachers and kids. He is not afraid to confront bad policy or their promoters when necessary which is why some people try to throw up false accusations often to just keep the status quo. While I and many others may not have agreed with Terence on some issues he was always very respectful of those who hold differing views.  If you want a true leader who is a voice for parents students and taxpayers vote for Terence Wall for Holmdel BoE.  Sincerely Joe Hammer,political,Facebook
This is a copy of the letter I sent to almost everyone listed below which includes WI Supreme Court WI DCI and WI DOJ and AG. The specifics of the letter start with the next sentence or paragraph.  Here is a copy of what I am publicizing because the WI Supreme Court WI DCI and WI DOJ are ignoring the claim government corruption is a primary item of investigation and justice as well as obeying the US and WI Constitutions. Many people are acknowledging this as true and I suspect Paul Ferguson did not provide the WI Supreme Court case which has significant proof and evidence of the crime and breaking both the US Constitution and the WI Constitution. Technically all of you should be impeached but you know government and law enforcement disobey the law and Constitution.  Here are the names of many of them that are disobeying the Constitution: Patience Roggensack Shirley Abrahamson Ann W Bradley Annette Ziegler Rebecca Bradley Daniel Kelly Rebecca Dallet Brian Hagedorn and Jill Karofsky (WI Supreme Court): Pete Thelen Jeff Wisch Brian OKeefe and Michael Sasse (WI DCI): Josh Kaul + previous one (AG): Eric Wilson Nate Zolik Chris McKinney (DOJ): and every democrat and republican within the state legislation and within the federal legislation for this state that BREAKS the Constitution.  Publicizing US Supreme Court Ruling in 1866 that pertains to WI Supreme Court WI DOJ WI DCI WI AG and WI law enforcement personnel and WI government attorneys and politicians: Now rest assured they all feel safe in disobeying this ruling and the US Constitution WI Constitution and Government Criminal Statute(s) because they are confident the government protects them from disobeying the Constitutions law and DOJ!  The WI Supreme Court WI DOJ WI DCI WI AG are just as dishonest as every democrat and republican because they Reject the Constitution. Their office was contacted and they all refused to speak to me. Here is confirmation that they should be impeached just as every other democrat and republican should be impeached! Here it is:  Supreme Court ruling in 1866  Neither the legislator not any executive or judicial officer may disregard the provisions of the Constitution in case of emergency or any other reason.  Section 98 therefore anyone who declares the suspension of Constitutionally guaranteed rights and or attempts to enforce such suspension within  independent sovereign continental United States of America is making war against our Constitution and therefore we the people. They violate their Constitutional oath and thus immediately forfeit their office and authority and their proclamations may be disregarded with impunity and that means anyone; even the Governor or President.  That is why THEY support the government breaking the Constitution and stealing $500000 which with interest has now exceeded $1500000! This letter verifies that the Supreme Court WI DCI WI DOJ and AG are HARASSING me.  In reading the petitions and the court case for 2018AP001816-OA you will see WI Statutes 751.06 and 809.70 demands you accept and proceed with the case.  This is technically a petition not just a letter.  Once more I will remind all of you; in reality all of you should be justices who have the discretionary to correct your mistake and return the large sum of money the City of Menasha stole from the Ribble Trust as per both Constitutions for Just Compensation! Just Compensation has now passed $1500000 so I will continue to encourage you to obey the US Constitution and the WI Constitution!,political,Facebook

Government leaders are servants not rulers in America.  Every time government uses force and mandates to try to achieve a desired result Americans naturally bristle. Its in our DNA.  Individual freedom is what sets America apartthat no one is free unless the rights of each individual are respected by government. The collective good can never trample individual God-given rights recognized in our constitution because if it does then none of our rights are secure.  Government leaders need to CONVINCE people not mandate actions. Using force and mandates are counterproductive means to increase vaccination rates. The more forceful the mandate the more public resistance it generates.  If government leaders want the appearance of doing something they issue mandatesand even worse they issue those mandates by unconstitutional decrees. On the other hand if they want to be effective they inspire people and convince them with scientific facts that withstand healthy scrutiny and robust questioning.  That is why it is such a fundamental mistake for our President and Governor to still be issuing emergency executive orders instead of allowing Congress and the Illinois General Assembly their essential roles in representing the public as constitutionally co-equal branches of government.  Congress and the Illinois Legislature need to hold public hearings questioning scientists and health experts deliberate in public and allow the people to also be heard. We need to recognize the diversity of our country and our state and that one size never fits all. We need to respect local control. Our battle against all variants of COVID-19 can only be won by inspirational leadership that motivates our people.  My colleague made a timeless point that when rights are taken away they are almost never given back. As a public servant I will fiercely oppose unconstitutionally forceful mandates that are counterproductive and that also have the effect of diminishing long-term individual freedom.,political,Facebook

Sacrifice..  Its a word that so few of us actually understand. There was a time when sacrifice was the standard. When parents sacrificed their pleasures and happiness to make sure their children had the absolute best opportunity for a better life. When everyone in our Country sacrificed to stop the spread of communism- young men on the front lines women working at home; the staggering death toll of 60 million deaths during WWII. Everyone was effected in some way.  Today as Hong Kong is now part of the Communist Regime; Today as China is camped on Taiwans doorsteps unopposed; Today as we bury 15 young servicemen in the US; Today as we allow Afghanistan to fall back into a breeding ground for terrorist training camps; Today as China meets with taliban leaders - today what are we sacrificing?  We are still arguing over the sacrifice of wearing a mask to protect our sick and elderly - to protect them from a man made virus that attacks the elderly the sick and the overweight disproportionately. A virus made by the Chinese communist. A virus that has shut down all civil discourse. A virus that has led to censorship. A virus that has left a void in world reporting. A virus that has left a void in true journalism. A virus that has left a huge void in critical thinking.  Not one shot has been fired for the vast majority of liberals and conservatives alike to abandon their ideals and principles.  I am so proud of the young men and women serving our country today. They were just babies on Sept. 11th when terrorist tried to instill fear in America.  I pray that our Country returns to be the beacon of freedom; shining light for all. I pray we come together in Unity to rise up against the spread of socialism. I pray we keep evil afar so it does not end up at our doorsteps. What if the war was fought on our soil? There were 45 Million Civilian deaths during WWII. These civilians these families lived in true fear of a war raging all around them. It is because our brave leaders our brave military our brave young men sacrificed to end the spread of communism and went to the battle to protect the battle from coming to the USA.  I pray that we as Christians; that we as proud Americans are speaking life and unity into our children. I pray we are raising children to love the United States. I pray that all children will understand the sacrifices made in our history. I pray that our families will sacrifice just a tiny bit to give every child the opportunity to grow up in prosperity loving this greatest nation on Earth.  These sacrifices start at home. These sacrifices start with Christian beliefs of loving our neighbors. To sacrifice our own desires; our own selfish ambitions; to sacrifice our time tithes & talents to make sure our children all children have a better world to grow up in.  It starts at home. Teaching Unity. Teaching Love. Teaching Respect. Teaching healthy question of authority. Teaching Critical thinking. Teaching healthy discourse. Teaching discipline. Teaching to sacrifice the short term pleasure of today for the long term prosperity of Tomorrow.,political,Facebook
FLY A FLAG IT'S THE 4TH  Our flag is an inspiring symbol that unites us all as American citizens. The unique history of the American flag follows the history of our country and reminds us of the triumphant beginning of the United States. The 13 stripes: a symbol of the first 13 colonies. The stars: a symbol of our country's 50 United States. As our country grew and developed so did our flag. It has followed the fate of the country itself and in the future our flag may add stars again.  Today our flag remains a vibrant symbol of the American principles of democracy justice and freedom and of course the everlasting memory of those who have sacrificed their lives defending these intrinsic principles of the United States of America.

Why am I running for office? I own a bike shop in the city so I like to say that I am biking for city council. While working I have had the chance to meet and talk to residents. I have realized my concerns about the city's direction are very similar to most residents concerns whether they are life long residents or recent transplants. My family is in the latter group. We moved here 4 years ago and we think it's a terrific community with great people who take an active role in their community.  I read a book in college called Bowling Alone. It explained that the decline of social connectedness in America (the reason we now are bowling alone) is attributed to the lack of local civic engagement on a city and town level. Our community I feel is one of the few that still has an extremely high amount of civic engagement. Sometimes local races can get too heated and I have pledged to stay civil and respectful. I know that whoever wins North Ogden will remain a strong community as long as we all continue to take an active and engaged interest in our city's governance.,political,Facebook
There is a solid noise for defunding the police in the USA. And also there is another group that wanted to keep the police. I am not fond of the police. I have seen and experienced NYPD systematically harassing Muslim immigrants Taxi Limo Black Car and private car drivers. The NYC Mayor Bloomberg orchestrated a scheme to target Muslims in NYC. NYPD used Hispanic police or Hispanic police to take advantage of the NYC policy to harassing Muslims. Most Hispanics walked into the USA and lived or were raised in a disadvantageous social community.  In contrast most Muslims migrated to the USA from the middle class or upper-middle class. Of course some emigrated to the USA by DV 12 OP 1 Students Visa and some are chain immigrants just like myself. But NYPD found entertainment with them in the name of preventing terrorist attacks in NYC. NYPD destroyed lots of families by unnecessarily pulling over and writing summons in pretext to identify the individuals. I fought against NYPD and was arrested two times by the Hispanic female police and dozens of summons wrote against me during 2001-2008.  I paid nearly ten thousand dollars for tickets and several times my license was suspended due to the loss of points and unpaid fines and penalties. I tried to organize Muslim Taxi Driver Association to fight against Bloomberg. Still I could not because almost all Muslim Taxi Limo and Black Car Drivers were immigrants and some of their asylum cases are pending. That's why they do not want to be politically organized rather endure police harassment and pay the fine. In Colonial America the county sheriff was the most critical law enforcement official. For instance the New York Sheriff's Office was founded in 1626. The county sheriff an elected official was responsible for enforcing laws collecting taxes supervising elections and handling the legal business of the county government. Sheriffs would investigate crimes and make arrests after citizens filed complaints or provided information about a crime but did not carry out patrols or otherwise take preventative action. Villages and cities typically hired constables and marshals who were empowered to make arrests and serve warrants. Many municipalities also formed a night watch or group of citizen volunteers who would patrol the streets at night looking for crime or fires. Typically constables and marshals were the primary law enforcement officials available during the day while the night watch would serve during the night. Eventually municipalities formed day watch groups. Local militias handled rioting.  Policing is a new concept in the USA. It is not fully understood what it is. It does multitask and systematically harass people and prey on easy targets to fill up the quota. Without them the looters and criminals will create anarchy. And keeping them the helpless people will be systematically abused. If you want peace in life leave the big cities and live in a small town. If there were no criminals in society I would boldly say terminate the police department. #nyc ##NYPD #nypdfinest #defundthepolce #police #politics,political,Facebook

The architects of the Common Core curriculum site other countries as examples when comparing educational systems. Their prime examples Finland Japan Sweden and South Korea all performed well on the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA).  What the people fail to realize is #America differs from these countries in one primary way. Cultural Diversity. While these countries are generally populated by persons with similar genetic and sociological backgrounds America is populated by a very diverse citizenry. We come from all parts of the world and bring with us our own sociological and genetic backgrounds.  As a country diversity is present everywhere. When the country is broken down into regions and states the population becomes less diverse. The upper Midwest has a very large population of Germanic ancestry. Those of Irish descent predominantly reside in the Northeast. People of Mexican decent primarily reside in Texas and the Southwest region. The examples can go further but the point is this: the diversity of our nation forbids a one size fits all curriculum.  As those regions and states are broken down into counties/parishes and towns the citizens become even less diverse. There will always be a predominate heritage for these areas. A curriculum of which those of Irish descent in the Northeast approve will be found to be inadequate by a different predominate group in another region. This is why we need to return curriculum control to the local level. #GiveUsOurSchoolsBack,political,Facebook
"Partisan politics in Brewster elections--we are seeing one group largely incumbents running as a ""slate"" all endorsing one another. Another group is claimed to be associated with Cape Patriots a MAGA group. Our community becomes polarized with this approach which mimics the dysfunction we see at the national level.

We have always had an active Democratic Town Committee and have traditionally had an active Republican Committee as well. But in the past even these traditionally partisan groups focused on what was best for Brewster.  I have always maintained my status as an Independent.

I am running with the hopes of making a positive contribution to our Town to make life here perhaps a little better for us all if I can to assist in land use decisions that will protect and preserve our Town and for affordable housing that will help our Brewster families and seniors.  I intend to keep this posture through the election. You won't see my signs clumped in a ""slate"" and I will maintain my independent status.

Critical Race Theory in Education Scholars Respond to Executive Memo M-20-34  On September 4 2020 Russell Vought Director of the Office of Management and Budget for the Executive Office of the President issued M-20-34 a memorandum for the heads of executive offices and agencies. The document states that Executive Branch agencies have spent millions of taxpayer dollars to date on training government workers to believe divisive anti-American propaganda. As critical race scholars working in universities and communities across the globe the following statement is our response to Mr. Voughts memorandum.  Critical Race Theory (CRT) is committed to the historical documentation and naming of atrocities carried out in this country in the name of freedom and liberty. In spite of this historical context the claim that the United States is founded on freedom from tyranny freedom of expression and speech and the right to exist as a whole person are ideals that all citizens of the US are taught in school to value cherish and honor. From our purview as scholars of race and education the United States of America has struggled to uphold not only the Constitution but also the Preamble of the Constitution. We are clear that racial healing cannot occur absent the recognition of the historical and current struggle against all forms of structural oppression that encumber the U.S. from ever fully living up to its democratic ideals.  Conflating Critical Race Theory (CRT) with workshops on white privilege is an example of the profound ignorance the current administration has as it pertains to studying and understanding race in the United States. Furthermore labeling CRT an area of scholarly study and diversity training that examines the role of white privilege as divisive and anti-American is an affront to the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. The current attempts to silence and suppress CRT also violate principles of academic freedom upheld by the American Association of University Professors.  We are deeply concerned about the lack of understanding ignorance and silencing of Black Indigenous and other scholars of color who have been instruments in the fight against racism sexism classism and all xenophobic ways of thinking. We are outraged over a federal call to end efforts to name racism and address systemic racial inequities. We are disappointed to see leaders weaponize their position and power to further fuel racial discord during a time of significant racial unrest. We are disturbed that the Office of the President would denounce a well-vetted rigorous and theoretically sound framework that thousands of scholars have utilized for the last 40 years to understand how race shapes every imaginable societal system.  CRT is necessary and powerful in the fight against systemic racism and essential to antiracist educational and professional development and training. We call on our institutions fellow academicians institutional leaders community partners policymakers and all who have benefitted from CRT or learned as a result of their participation in anti-racism workshops to stand with us in acknowledging that systemic racism exists and is violence against ALL humanity. If this country is to insure domestic tranquility it must work to protect ALL people and make ALL people safe. We refute any communication that denies social and political realities and prohibits forward movement toward a racially just society. We support academic work by those who are fearful of open and critical discourse. We honor the reality that multiple histories and experiences exist for the diversity of peoples in the United States for every race ethnicity gender identity religion brings with it its own histories included in and not erased by a whitewashed American experience. Most importantly we fight against willful ignorance hatred and violence due to racism. The revolutionary roots of CRT drive us to contest such injustices. We have a lot of work to do. But we remain committed to engaging together in the worthwhile struggle to move this nation toward Dr. Martin Luthers King Jr.s vision of a beloved community.

As Americans we seem to be drifting further apart every second of every day. The level of hatred can be felt almost anywhere you go in this country and its even worse online. People just dont seem to like each other anymore right? But why? Wars? Riots? Masks? Covid? Vaccines? Minimum wage? Abortion? Taxation? Trump? Biden? The Pope? Conservatives? Liberals? We could go on and on and   If you had a megaphone (or the virtual equivalent of one) and could speak to every single person in America at the exact same time what would your message be?  P.S. look no further than the comments on this post to get a flavor for whats happening in America.,political,Facebook
"I apologize for the long read but it is a concern of many of our fellow Grove resident that Ive spoke with. So I want to address it. The phrase ""No Taxation Without Representation!"" was coined by Reverend Jonathan Mayhew in a sermon in Boston in 1750. It gained strength through the American Revolution and has been mentioned numerous times in Congressional Bills over the last 230 years. I know our American fight for Independence is a massive difference from our small middle America town however many of our fellow residents have voiced concern relating to it. I discussed it with a few past and present Grove City Council Representatives recently and have learned that it has came up many times and always gets brushed under the rug because it would create a lot of work amending our City By-Laws. Well isnt doing the right thing right at the end of the day. Thats what the Council is supposed to do is whats right by the constituents that put them in office. To wrap this lengthy post up when I am elected to represent Ward 2 I plan to push the idea of giving our rural residents who contribute tax revenue to our City via taxes on their utility bills a voice and vote that they currently lack by pushing to change whatever needs changed. No guarantees as one Councilman only has one voice and one vote but its just one of my goals for Grove.",political,Facebook
Where is this world headed? Even the secular unbelieving world is stunned at all that is happening in our collapsing world. Most have no explanation for it. Some offer weak explanations that to the tuned-in and spiritually astute are laughable. Even once-sound pulpits remain silent and perplexed.Some commentators suggest that if we just elect their candidate all will be rosy again someday soon. Their faith is in their party. We Will Own Nothing and be Happy? Some promise that if we fix climate change and spread the wealth around we will achieve peace on earth. Outfits like the World Economic Forum suggest some day if we follow their formula we will own nothing and be happy! How can society be happy under a Godless regime? Here are my conclusions as to why were where we are in history. I am sure the list is much longer than this but here goes: Our times are perilous because God is trying to wake up and warn a sinful world. People dont listen when life is smooth-sailing. The Bible is fulfilling itself. It predicts perilous times (II Timothy 3); a Laodicea end-time church; a Romans 1 society at the end characterized by depravity. Evil and violence will escalate. The birth pangs will become intense and will be hard to watch and read about. We get worn out seeing floods fires droughts and hurricanes. But the Bible says these things must happen. God is warning because He always warns before He judges and the world is facing judgment. It is being judged now but far worse is coming during the Tribulation. This is just a warm-up. There are terrible consequences when we dont do things Gods way. Society will fail. The church will head into apostasy. But prideful mankind always thinks their way is best and wreckage results. God is specifically sending a message to His church. He is trying to shake us up so that we will wake up and ultimately look up. America and the world are now caught up in end-time strong delusion. That has serious consequences. Delusion does not permit people to think rationally and to act reasonably. It does not allow people to vote sensibly. The consequences are staggering. Many think that strong leaders will be the savior or a particular party. They just want to make America great again but minus Gods oversight. God is letting us know that only one nation under God will ever function properly and no nation can be great and Godless. America showed God the door fifty years ago. That has consequences. His blessing and protection may have left when we opened that door! God is allowing some pre-Tribulation birth pains on the entire world. But what we see happening today is minor compared to what is coming. The Church will be absent during that Tribulation time so in the meantime may we have a greater burden to save people from the wrath to come. The consequences for a world that rejects Jesus Christ are unthinkable. America and other Western powers have to fade as world influencers so that global powers can rise up and rule the world. As these nations diminish keep in mind that this is orchestrated by God for his end-time purposes. Lastly I think there is chaos on earth because Satan knows his time is short and he has ramped up his activity. He is getting new recruits for his kingdom. This is all the more reason we must be salt and light in these final days. What Did You Expect the End-Times to Look Like?,political,Facebook
Good Morning ! I hope each of you are having a wonderful day. I am posting in response to a few emails I have received. We at Mrs Southern Sass believe strongly in freedom of speech and expression of self. I do not force my opinions on other and I will not allow you to force yours on me or my daughter. 1) We are very patriotic and love America. We do not support the person some of you voted for to run our country. If you feel he is a good president and leader then great. I respect your opinion. Mine is obviously different. 2) We do not hide the fact we support our police officers. We are thankful for their efforts in keeping us safe and are humbled at the idea these men and women are willing to die for us and our safety. You WILL NOT CHANGE MY OPINION. 3) We are a military family. My son  my baby boy at 18 years old is willing to give up his life to protect this country. To protect you and your rights. I have blood in this fight. Our soldiers are our heros . When they are disrespected you will see a side of me that isn't the most pleasant. We here at Mrs. Southern Sass speak our mind believe in guns believe in freedom believe in God believe in kindness and respect. If you do not like our designs scroll past. I'm sure there is another small business that has your views and beliefs. Don't try to make me change mine. We are NOT the kind of people who will be fake just to get business. THIS IS US ! WE ARE PROUD TO BE WHO WE ARE! For our wonderful customers who support us and understand that not all of our designs will be your taste but you support us anyway Thank you. We truly appreciate y'all ,political,Facebook
A Liberal Explains the Cause of High Gas Prices Forget the fact that Joe Biden killed the Keystone Pipeline deal and cost the U.S. thousands of jobs and forget that he put a moratorium on all new oil and gas leases on federal land and offshore waters. Dont think about how he is suffocating domestic oil production with mandates such as establishing comprehensive standards of performance and emission guidelines from existing oil and gas operations by September 2021 and ordering Texas to submit State Implementation Plan for Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) by January 2022. Of course these policies will make us no longer energy independent and U.S. oil imports are expected to rise 2 million barrels per day by 2030 and U.S. gross domestic product will be declining $700 billion during the same span but that is not why gas prices are rising. Neither is fact that U.S. oil production is expected to decline 230000 barrels a day in 2021. Right-wing nut job conspiracy theorists and QAnon will tell you that is reason gas prices are going up. Those people are spreading disinformation! They might even try to tell you how Joe Biden waived sanctions on Russias pipeline while at the same time pulling the plug on our own Keystone pipeline which infuriated one of our strongest allies in Canada. While he did give our Russian enemy the same thing he took away from our neighboring Canadian allies that is not why gas prices are high. And dont think about how he hamstrung domestic oil production then recently turned around and asked OPEC to produce more oil instead of figuring out a way for the U.S. to produce more oil even though he ran on an America first platform. His inconsistent messaging and terrible policies have nothing to do with the high price of gas. That is nothing more than a right-wing conspiracy being spread by unsophisticated xenophobic white supremacists. These people probably want you to think about his rhetoric during the 2020 campaign when he called Saudi Arabia a pariah state with no redeeming social value only to see Saudi Arabia retaliate immediately after Joe Biden took office by committing to unilaterally cut 1 million barrels of oil. People spreading disinformation want you to believe that they did this to pressure Joe Biden into not penalizing Saudi Arabias crown prince Mohammed bin Salam for directly approving the killing of Jamal Khashoggi the Washington Post columnist who was drugged and dismembered in 2018. They probably also want you to believe it worked too and how Joe Biden did nothing to hold Mohammed bin Salam accountable for fear of upsetting U.S. Arabian allies. Some people might even argue that he failed on the humanitarian front by not seeking justice for the killing of an American citizen and he also failed on an economic front as well by allowing himself to be bullied by the Saudis. Even though this is a blatant lie let's just say he did fail on multiple fronts by not taking a clear position on that foreign policy decision. So what? That is not the reason gas prices are going up. In fact none of Joe Bidens terrible policies or bad decisions have anything to do with the price of gas today. Any expert will tell you that it is physically impossible for Joe Biden to cause a rise in the price of gas. Follow the science. All the data suggests that a man who wears aviator shades and eats ice cream could never screw anything up so bad that gas prices could rise 50% in just 8 months. It is metaphysically impossible. Blaming Joe Biden for the rise in gas prices is nothing more than a wild conspiracy theory. The real reason that gas prices are so high today are because of one man and one man alone. DONALD J.

The mask mandates are really just kind of silly at this point. They should be lifted completely  the sudden overnight shift in guidance from CDC this week demonstrates how un-Scientific this has been for a good while now. It wasnt that long ago that Dr. Fauci was recommending *two* masks for everyone recall.  How does it work? Do they make you show your vaccine Papers at the door? Do you have to show them an app on your phone to enter the building? No of course not. This is America. We dont do stuff like that here.  Public buildings should be fully re-opened no masks required. Public meetings should be opened to the public *and* livestreamed so that people who want to attend can choose whats best for their circumstances. And anybody who wants to wear a mask should do so  its a free country; I would *never* criticize somebodys personal choice regarding their health & well-being. Whats right for you is completely up to you.  We are well past the crisis stage of this pandemic and vaccines are here to protect anyone who wants one.  Back to basics!

For Immediate Release: Our Response To President Bidens Visit to Idaho.  Mr. President We hope you enjoyed your time in Idaho this week. It must be a good feeling to get out of Washington DC. Unfortunately we were not able to connect while you were here. If we had been able to meet there are a few topics we would have discussed:  As with all things in life there are areas you can directly control those you influence and others you have no control over. As President there are clear boundaries about what you can control. As the 10th amendment says you can only do what is explicitly called out in the Constitution. Everything else must be done by influence. The Legislative branch has the ability to create laws but you do not. EVERYTHING else is owned by the states or individuals.  Over the past nine months of your presidency you have consistently overstepped your authority with states rights. Here in Idaho we believe in self-reliance and independence. Idahoans know what is best for Idaho - not you.  In addition the policies you have enacted are negatively impacting the next generation of Americans that we represent:  - Most small businesses are owned by the under 40 group. Increased regulation tax increases and mandates are suffocating small businesses. Thousands have closed their doors.  - Inconsistencies in your COVID communication is causing confusion and mistrust. Decisions on schools impact our children. Parents are trying to juggle careers with potentially having to stay home due to closures. Vaccine mandates risk the jobs for many young professionals. The federal government has no place in requiring private citizens or businesses to be vaccinated. You have violated your promise to never mandate vaccines when you campaigned. It also sets precedent for a scary future. You are not exhibiting leadership. It is coercion.  - The rising inflation is hitting Americans at a time without much discretionary spending available. Inflation is the highest since the 1970s. Home prices are the highest in history. Gas prices are averaging $2 per gallon HIGHER than just 10 months ago. While it may appear great to have a wage increase in jobs it doesnt matter if the cost increase is higher to do business. Those costs are passed down to consumers or businesses stop hiring as many people.  - Your unwillingness to address crime and homelessness in the country is impacting Idaho. Look at Seattle Chicago New York Portland. Do you really believe things are going well there? We have thousands of people from these states fleeing into Idaho because of the failed policies there. This is placing tremendous pressure on Idaho infrastructure land and energy use and more.  - A really in-depth conversation is needed about your foreign and military policy. We are very disappointed in your handling of Afghanistan to put it politely. The mismanagement cost the lives of young Americans.  - You came to discuss wildfires in Idaho but it turned into statements about global warming. While we all agree in being good stewards of the environment you neglected to the discuss the mismanagement of federal lands that make up about 70% of Idaho. This increases the likelihood of devastating forest fires.  Overall if you look at many of the nations key performance indicators almost all of them are trending worse than just one year ago. You must recognize this. Your poll numbers are lower and decreasing faster than any President during their first year in office.  Please recognize that we arent seeking to condemn. We genuinely want to help. You are the President currently. If you fail America fails. Please let us know if you have time to discuss further. Wed be happy to meet with you.  Oh one last thing It seems like every time you try to take questions your microphone stops working. Wed be happy to buy you a megaphone so you dont run into these technical issues anymore.  Sincerely Idaho Young Republicans    #idpol #idleg,political,Facebook

"FEDERAL DEBT REVISITED  The talk about the U.S. federal debt while always present has ratcheted-up during the past year as the U.S. has added an additional $4 trillion of debt during this period. Most of this new debt is the result of successive COVID-19 related legislative packages.  Debate over this debt will continue for decades much of the debate will be directed towards who should bear the burden of this debt. The burden for payment of this debt will be directed towards the working and middle classes unless these economic classes pay attention to what is going on and insist that the burden be placed elsewhere.  For 60 years we have watched progressive tax rates decline--a trend which accelerated during the 1980's while deficits mounted. For unexplainable reasons the working and middle classes succumbed to the idea that it would be better to borrow from the upper economic classes rather than tax this class for federal government expenditures.  But now that the debt is here what are we to do? The answer to this question is ultimately a policy choice and to make the right policy choices we will need to understand ways in which the debt can be managed.  It is important from the start to recognize that the U.S. Federal budget is unlike a household budget so we need to be careful not project our household budget experience on to the federal government. The U.S. government as a sovereign authority with its own currency has complete control over the creation and destruction of its currency. It creates money when it spends it destroys money when it taxes and borrows. Money creation and destruction should be calibrated in a manner which maximizes well-being while avoiding inflationary pressures in the goods services and asset markets. The federal government has also delegated money creation to the Federal Reserve the nation's central bank and by extension to the commercial banking sector through this sector's lending activities. For our purposes we need not consider commercial bank money creation activity.  So let's run through a few different ways in which the debt can be managed. The Federal Reserve (FED) a creature of Congress can purchase Treasury debt in the private markets and then simply extinguish the debt. The debt extinguishment however would knock an equal chunk off the asset side of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. Under current practices over time this loss would pass to the Treasury Department--which would undo the debt elimination. To avoid this the FED could create an intangible asset category perhaps entitled: ""For the Good of America"" intangible asset category which would offset the loss from the debt extinguishment. This is merely an accounting maneuver but the account would reflect real intangible value for the American people: debt elimination. This is not unlike an intangible asset category found on a corporate balance sheet. During the 2011 federal budget ceiling crisis Senator Rand Paul proposed legislation which called for the FED to extinguish federal debt which the FED held on its balance sheet (H.R. 2768). It is unclear how the accounting was to be handled under Paul's proposal.  The Treasury could also mint a platinum coin stamped with a value equal to the proposed debt extinguishment and exchange the coin for the debt held by the Federal Reserve. This would amount to a debt pay-off. This idea also proposed during the 2011 debt ceiling crisis found support in both the financial and legal communities.  Another option would be the FED could purchase privately held Treasury debt and simply roll the debt over into perpetuity. Federal Reserve earnings are paid to the Treasury Department so FED earnings on Treasury securities would be returned to the Treasury Department. This would amount to an interest free loan which would never have to be paid-off.  The problem with all three scenarios is that it likely involves the Federal Reserve entering the financial markets through an exchange of newly created dollars for the privately held Treasury debt. This would add substantial liquidity to the financial markets further inflating financial asset values in what may already be inflated asset markets. Taxation within this market would be needed not to fund the Treasury securities purchases the FED would create new money for this purpose but taxation would be necessary to absorb excessive liquidity out of this market due to the FED purchases of Treasury debt. Tax increases in this market need not equal the debt purchases but rather should be calibrated in a manner which removes excessive liquidity from the financial markets.  There are other possible ways to manage the debt in a manner which avoids placing the burden on working and middle class families. The important thing to remember is that the federal government is not like a household. It unlike a household has the authority to create its own money restrained only by the inflationary impact of such money creation. Taxation and borrowing are tools of money destruction to be used to control this inflationary impact. In our case taxation in the asset markets would be utilized to deflate inflated asset values which may result from the Federal Reserve's purchase and extinguishment of Federal debt.  The federal debt can be managed in such a way that it is not a burden to the working and middle classes. But it will be a burden to the working and middle classes if we are unaware of how all of this works. Armed with this knowledge we can destroy the analogy of the federal budget to that of the household budget and more appropriately allocate the burden if necessary to that segment of the population which has benefited from debt financed federal deficits.

In the year 2000 I wrote a book titled Rip Van America attempting to w a r n the church at Large and our politicians about the destruction of our country.  Pastors and politicians not only ignored it but are the very reason why we have had this demonic takeover of our country! I gave copies to the staff a major International minister whose home I had been in more than once and was called upon to minister healing in one of his regular meetings on campus. When he found out that I gave them copies of Rip Van America he got so Disturbed he sent out 50 thousand letters telling his churches and ministers who he mentored to not have anything to do with politics or the United States government! He refused to have anything to do with me after that and would not even talk to me!  Is it any wonder that a liberal and criminal bunch have taken over our government? The blame lies with the church leaders and Christians at Large having their heads in the sand!  Some are waking up after the current disastrous takeover by a coup but without a major Revival our nation is doomed! It's going to take more than prayer to turn this mess around! As Christians God put us in charge of this country and we must use our Authority to turn it around!  If you agree with this please share it to help turn this nation back to God!,political,Facebook

AFTER THE 2021 OFF YEAR ELECTIONS  The 2021 off-year elections showed the continuing appeal of American nationalist themes previously exhibited in on the congressional side of the 2020 elections. However the divisive methods of appealing to this pride resulted in close races where almost all the victors won narrowly. The use of emotional dog-whistles like critical race theory or former President Trumps responsibility for the January 6 insurrection obscures the issues that we must face to truly build a strong America.  As I mentioned in this previous post we have been in such politically divisive days before and survived to renew our civil political culture. In post-Civil War 19th century politics the real social and economic dislocations caused by the Industrial Revolution were obscured by campaigns about the tangential issues of alcohol temperance religion and responsibility for the Civil War or Rum Romanism & Rebellion as it was called by one observer. Similar red herrings are used by todays political propagandists to distract us from the real issues. The modern equivalent of Rum is the abortion and other social issues which distract us from discussing the real crises faced by todays families attempting to raise moral and successful children. Instead of warnings about the supposed religious threat of Romanism we now focus on woke politics critical race theory and other ethnic grievances rather than improving the education of our children to insure they can compete in the world workforce. Finally the constant harping over the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol enables our leaders to avoid addressing the sources of the extremism on both sides that justifies political violence (see this previous post).  Two years ago this website was started to cut through these emotional dog-whistles used by extremists on both sides by highlighting the real issues that weaken the America and its people in an age of rising nationalism elsewhere. I believed the way Theodore Roosevelt guided us out of the political abyss of the late 19th century was a model for curing the fevered politics of these times. He like us all was never perfect in his actions (see this post) but he was a pioneer of his time on them. Over the next year and in preparation for the next election we will continue to help you identify the true issues facing America and act on them. For example we will develop a new American Nationalist Voting Index you can use to evaluate your local congressional candidates in the upcoming 2022 elections. There will also be some changes in the structure of the website including a new subscription service that will deliver website posts right to your e-mail box.  Thank you for your attention and support for the website. It is my goal to continue to inform you on how you can preserve a strong America and the American Dream.

"I remember watching him in a Western film years ago - he had a baby-face and looked like a teenager- I thought how can this boy be the most decorated War Hero of WWII - Quite a Man.  Subject: Audie Murphy's Wife - A beautiful story    Audie Murphy the kid from Farmersville Texas was only 46 years old when he died in a helicopter crash into the Virginia Mts. He was bothered all his life when he came back from the War and it really affected his life. He never got the medical help he should have gotten.  Not many young people know who Audie Murphy was or how big a war hero he was. Two or three of the medals he earned would make most service men proud but to have earned his decorations in battle is truly unbelievable.  List of Decorations for Audie Murphy:  Medal of Honor  Distinguished Service Cross Silver Star (with oak leaf cluster) Legion of Merit Bronze Star (with oak leaf cluster and Valor Device) Purple Heart (with two oak leaf clusters) U.S. Army Outstanding Civilian Service Medal U.S. Army Good Conduct Medal Presidential Unit Citation (with First Oak Leaf Cluster) American Campaign Medal European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal (with One Silver Star Four Bronze Service Stars (representing nine Campaigns) and one Bronze Arrowhead (representing assault landing at Sicily and Southern France) World War II Victory Medal Army of Occupation Medal (with Germany Clasp) Armed Forces Reserve Medal French Fourrage in Colors of the Croix de Guerre French Legion of Honor - Grade of Chevalier French Croix de guerre (with Silver Star) French Croix de guerre (with Palm) Medal of Liberated France Belgian Croix de guerre (with 1940 Palm)  Additionally Murphy was awarded: The Combat Infantry Marksman badge with Rifle Bar Expert Badge with Bayonet Bar.  Isn't it sad the media can tell us all about the BAD that goes on but ignores the GOOD people? If a movie Star or politician stubs their toe we have to hear about it for Days!!!  From the Los Angeles Times on April 15 2010  Pamela Murphy widow of WWII hero and actor Audie Murphy died peacefully at her home on April 8 2010. She was the widow of the most decorated WWII hero and actor Audie Murphy and established her own distinctive 35 year career working as a patient liaison at the Sepulveda Veterans Administration hospital treating every veteran who visited the facility as if they were a VIP.  Any soldier or Marine who came into the hospital got the same special treatment from her. She would walk the hallways with her clipboard in hand making sure her boys got to see the specialist they needed.  If they didn't watch out.  Her boys weren't Medal of Honor recipients or movie stars like Audie but that didn't matter to Pam. They had served their Country. That was good enough for her. She never called a veteran by his first name. It was always ""Mister."" Respect came with the job.  ""Nobody could cut through VA red tape faster than Mrs. Murphy"" said veteran Stephen Sherman speaking for thousands of veterans she befriended over the years. ""Many times I watched her march a veteran who had been waiting more than an hour right into the doctor's office.  She was even reprimanded a few times but it didn't matter to Mrs. Murphy. ""Only her boys mattered. She was our angel.""  Audie Murphy died broke in a plane crash in 1971 squandering millions of dollars on gambling bad investments and yes other women. ""Even with the adultery and desertion at the end he always remained my hero."" Pam told me.  She went from a comfortable ranch-style home in Van Nuys where she raised two sons to a small apartment - taking a clerk's job at the nearby VA to support herself and start paying off her faded movie star husband's debts. At first no one knew who she was. Soon though word spread through the VA that the nice woman with the clipboard was Audie Murphy's widow. It was like saying General Patton had just walked in the front door. Men with tears in their eyes walked up to her and gave her a Hug.  ""Thank you"" they said over and over.  The first couple of years I think the hugs were more for Audie's memory as a war hero. The last 30 years they were for Pam.  One year I asked her to be the focus of a Veteran's Day column for all the work she had done. Pam just shook her head no. ""Honor them not me"" she said pointing to a group of veterans down the hallway. ""They're the ones who deserve it.""  The vets disagreed Mrs. Murphy deserved the accolades they said. Incredibly in 2002 Pam's job was going to be eliminated in budget cuts. She was considered ""excess staff."" ""I don't think helping cut down on veterans' complaints and showing them the respect they deserve should be considered excess staff"" she told me.  Neither did the veterans. They went ballistic holding a rally for her outside the VA gates. Pretty soon word came down from the top of the VA. Pam Murphy was no longer considered ""excess staff.  She remained working full time at the VA until 2007 when she was 87.  ""The last time she was here was a couple of years ago for the conference we had for homeless veterans"" said Becky James coordinator of the VA's Veterans History Project. Pam wanted to see if there was anything she could do to help some more of her boys. Pam Murphy was 90 when she died.

"There are 10 new ideas that are changing America maybe permanently.  1. Money is a construct. It can be created from thin air. Annual deficits & aggregate national debt no longer matter much.  Prior presidents ran up huge annual deficits but at least there were some concessions that the money was real and had to be paid back. Not now. As we near $30 trillion in national debt and 110 percent of annual GDP our elites either believe permanent zero interest rates make the cascading obligation irrelevant or the larger the debt the more likely we will be forced to address needed income redistribution.  2. Laws are not necessarily binding anymore. Joe Biden took an oath to ""take care that the laws be faithfully executed."" But he has willfully rendered federal immigration laws null and void. Some rioters are prosecuted for violating federal laws others not so much. Arrests prosecutions and trials are all fluid. Ideology governs when a law is still considered a law. Crime rates do not necessarily matter. If someone is carjacked assaulted or shot it can be understood to be as much the victims fault as the perpetrators. Either the victim was too lax uncaring and insensitive or he provoked his attacker.  How useful the crime is to the larger agendas of the left determines whether a victim is really a victim and the victimizer really a victimizer.  3. Racialism is now acceptable. We are defined first by our ethnicity or religion and only secondarily  if at all  by an American commonality. The explicit exclusion of whites from college dorms safe spaces and federal aid programs is now noncontroversial. It is unspoken payback for perceived past sins or a type of ""good"" racism. Falsely being called a racist makes one more guilty than falsely calling someone else a racist.  4. The immigrant is mostly preferable to the citizen. The newcomer unlike the host is not stained by the sins of Americas founding and history. Most citizens currently must follow quarantine rules and social distancing stay out of school and obey all the laws.  Yet those entering the US illegally need not follow such apparently superfluous COVID-19 rules. Their children should be immediately schooled without worry of quarantine. Immigrants need not worry about their illegal entry or residence in America. Our elites believe illegal entrants more closely resemble the ""founders"" than do legal citizens about half of whom they consider irredeemable.  5. Most Americans should be treated as we would treat little children. They cannot be asked to provide an ID to vote. ""Noble lies"" by our elites about COVID-19 rules are necessary to protect ""Neanderthals"" from themselves. Americans deserve relief from the stress of grades standardized testing and normative rules of school behavior. They still are clueless about why it is good for them to pay far more for their gasoline heating and air conditioning.  6. Hypocrisy is pass. Virtue-signaling is alive. Climate change activists fly on private jets. Social justice warriors live in gated communities. Multibillionaire elitists pose as victims of sexism racism and homophobia. The elite need these exemptions to help the helpless. It is what you say to lesser others about how to live not how you yourself live that matters.  7. Ignoring or perpetuating homelessness is preferable to ending it. It is more humane to let thousands of homeless people live eat defecate and use drugs on public streets and sidewalks than it is to green-light affordable housing mandate hospitalization for the mentally ill and create sufficient public shelter areas.  8. McCarthyism is good. Destroying lives and careers for incorrect thoughts saves more lives and careers. Cancel culture and the Twitter Reign of Terror provide needed deterrence.  9. Ignorance is preferable to knowledge. Neither statue-toppling nor name-changing nor the 1619 Project require any evidence or historical knowledge. Heroes of the past were simple constructs. Undergraduate graduate and professional degrees reflect credentials not knowledge. The brand not what created it is all that matters.  10. Wokeness is the new religion growing faster and larger than Christianity. Its priesthood outnumbers the clergy and exercises far more power. Silicon Valley is the new Vatican and Amazon Apple Facebook Google and Twitter are the new gospels.  Americans privately fear these rules while publicly appearing to accept them. They still could be transitory and invite a reaction. Or they are already near-permanent and institutionalized.  The answer determines whether a constitutional republic continues as once envisioned or warps into something never imagined by those who created it.  By Victor Davis Hanson.

I just voted NO on the Continuing Resolution.  One of the most important responsibilities of the House of Representatives is to adequately fund our federal government. Democrats have put that responsibility on the backburner focused all their energy on Bernie Sanders $3.5 trillion spending spree and once again found themselves forced to ram through a last-minute Continuing Resolution to prevent a government shutdown. To make matters even worse Democrats are using this legislation to raise the debt ceiling to pay for their out-of-control federal spending at a time when the United States is nearly $29 trillion in debt.  Our nation is already facing record-high inflation a stagnant economy a humanitarian crisis at our southern border and national security threats from our adversaries following the catastrophic withdrawal from Afghanistan.

Sierra will work with the other Town Officials to modernize the town systems and fix the tax enforcement section of Champion to better serve the people that live in our town. Sierra Weston has received three endorsements for Town Clerk. One from James D Uhlinger III soon to be Town Council elect for Champion and another from Champion Town Councilman Matt Gump who is currently an elected Town Councilman and running for District 7 seat at the County level and Jonathan Schell running for Town Supervisor in Champion.  Also in the Town of Champion Angela McGill running for Town Justice and James Uhlinger III running for Town Council will both be running unopposed this November 2nd. Both are motivated individuals that will be advocates for the betterment of the people of Champion. Both share a passion for making sure public safety is a high priority issue whether thatd be from criminals or from hazardous road conditions from unattended road repair. Both will be major advocates for the Town and will be willing to fight for what's right when it comes down to the people of Champion.  Lastly Jonathan James Schell is running for Town Supervisor in Champion and wants to bring a new look to the position. Jon is a firm believer that Champion is a wonderful place to raise and family and to retire. Jon however understands that the way Champion is currently being operated is making it hard for those two life goals to be possible. Jon wants to upgrade Champion but without forgetting the town's roots. Jon understands that farming not only is the backbone of America but the backbone of Champion as well. Upgrading the town will come with making the tax in champion more understandable to the residents allowing the residents to do more in champion with less paperwork and restrictions and by reallocating funds in the budget for long term sustainability for the area to thrive for long periods of time instead of the same and constant quick fixes.

Former presidents have a history of taking on a cause to help the country. FORMER President Donald J Trump has a unique opportunity to do something that would help get our country past the devastation and economic problems caused by the pandemic. A significant number of Americans many of them Trump supporters are hesitant to get the vaccines that would get our country to herd immunity. Trump has shown through his bragging about the vaccines and the fact he and Melanie both got vaccinated that he does not share much of the anti vaccine sentiment as many of his followers. If he would enthusiastically encourage his followers to get vaccinated through PSAs and rallies we could maybe reach herd immunity in a few months. Because this might alienate some of his base he would also be showing political courage as well making America great again.,political,Facebook

Share if you agree!  Can we please all agree that no one likes cheaters? Can I get an Amen!  If so why is it that the Republican Party of our lifetime feels that it must constrain the right to vote e. g. cheat to remain or return to power?  Should not each or any political party place winning upon its principles rather than upon its ability to limit hours of voting where when and how many ballot drop boxes will be allowed the number of days of early voting or requirements for by-mail voting be on demand only or be at an each-ballot request even when the voter is well and securely verified in their legitimate right to vote. Why is that? Why are these measures being introduced and passed in numerous states. Isn't a problem necessary to bother with a solution?  If one cannot see that these new or proposed measures are corrupt in intent going far beyond strident identification protocols then we must question one's regard for the U.S. Constitution and in our democracy.  Now back to a party's principles. Are you aware that the Republican Party in fact did not formulate a party platform for the 2020 presidential election? Thus the GOP clearly demonstrated that is void of principles.  The answer to this rampant voter suppression that clearly targets legitimate voters that cannot afford to stand in long lines and missed paid time is The FOR THE PEOPLE ACT now before the U.S.Senate.  Stop the cheating Republicans let's see what policies you can offer to voters. Stop this maddening power grab...it is Un-American.

"Warning Signs to the Greatest Nation on Earth. By Stephen Hickman  I was heading home from a pastors meeting a few weeks ago and came to a crossroads. One direction lead home while the other direction lead farther away. Being preoccupied with other things I took a direction without following the signs and became uncertain as to whether I took the right turn. Not having my phone with its GPS coordinates the best way for me to know if I chose the right way was to follow the signs. If down the road a few miles the sign said Dayton/Columbus I knew I was on my way home but if it said St. Louis then I knew I would never reach my destination unless I turned back or turned around. God spoke to Israel in the days of Jeremiah: Stand at the crossroads and look; ask for the ancient paths ask where the good way is and walk in it and you will find rest for your souls. But you said We will not walk in it. (Jeremiah 6:16 NIV) What if we also have come to a crossroads in America ; said no to God and are heading down the wrong road? Let me give you five roadsigns to look for to see if we are past the crossroads and heading toward judgment:  1. Religion without righteousness: In talking about Jerusalem Isaiah wants us to ""See how the faithful city has become a prostitute! She once was full of justice; righteousness used to dwell in her but now murderers! (Isaiah 1:21 NIV) These murderers I would classify as abortionists with their clinics of destruction. ""Stop bringing meaningless offerings! Your incense is detestable to me....When you spread out your hands in prayer I hide my eyes from you; even when you offer many prayers I am not listening. Your hands are full of blood!"" (Isaiah 1:13-15 NIV)  2. People without conscience: Israel in Isaiah's day was called people of Sodom and people of Gomorrah and notice explicitly what they did in the great holy city of Jerusalem. ""Woe to the sinful nation a people whose guilt is great a brood of evildoers children given to corruption! They have forsaken the Lord; they have spurned the Holy One of Israel and turned their backs on himUnless the Lord Almighty had left us some survivors we would have become like Sodom we would have been like Gomorrah. Hear the word of the Lord you rulers of Sodom; listen to the instruction of our God you people of Gomorrah. (Isaiah 1:4 9-10 NIV) Jerusalem staggers Judah is falling; their words and deeds are against the Lord defying his glorious presence. The look on their faces testifies against them; they parade their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it. Woe to them! They have brought disaster upon themselves. (Isaiah 3:89 NIV) This last Scripture depicts even in Isaiahs day a Gay Pride Parade down the streets of Jerusalem. The punishment is no greater for our nation as it was for Israel where it said They have brought disaster upon themselves.  3. Politics without principles: ""Your rulers are rebels partners with thieves; they all love bribes and chase after gifts. They do not defend the cause of the fatherless; the widows case does not come before them."" (Isaiah 1:23 NIV) According to Moses the political leader whom God desires to lead the nation should do the following: ""Now it shall come about when he sits on the throne of his kingdom he shall write for himself a copy of this law on a scroll in the presence of the Levitical priests. It shall be with him and he shall read it all the days of his life that he may learn to fear the LORD his God by carefully observing all the words of this law and these statutes that his heart may not be lifted up above his countrymen and that he may not turn aside from the commandment to the right or the left so that he and his sons may continue long in his kingdom in the midst of Israel. (Deuteronomy 17:18-20 NASB) Would to God that we could elect a leader of that caliber. Today the majority in our nation would not even want a leader to quote the Bible as a rule of conduct. No wonder there is no fear of God in the land.  4. Business without ethics/wealth without work: Your silver has become dross your choice wine is diluted with water. (Isaiah 1:22 NIV) God will bless a nation with business/work ethics: The Lord will open the heavens the storehouse of his bounty to send rain on your land in season and to bless all the work of your hands. You will lend to many nations but will borrow from none. The Lord will make you the head not the tail. If you pay attention to the commands of the Lord your God that I give you this day and carefully follow them you will always be at the top never at the bottom. (Deuteronomy 28:12-13 NIV) God will curse a nation without business/work ethics: The foreigners who reside among you will rise above you higher and higher but you will sink lower and lower. They will lend to you but you will not lend to them. They will be the head but you will be the tail. (Deuteronomy 28:43-44 NIV)  5. The fear of man instead of the fear of God: God sees those that are arrogant who see no value in fearing God. But if you notice in the following scripture God definitely takes care of his own and will someday differentiate between the wicked and the righteous. You have spoken arrogantly against me says the Lord. Yet you ask What have we said against you? You have said It is futile to serve God. What do we gain by carrying out his requirements and going about like mourners before the Lord Almighty? But now we call the arrogant blessed. Certainly evildoers prosper and even when they put God to the test they get away with it.  Then those who feared the Lord talked with each other and the Lord listened and heard. A scroll of remembrance was written in his presence concerning those who feared the Lord and honored his name. On the day when I act says the Lord Almighty they will be my treasured possession. I will spare them just as a father has compassion and spares his son who serves him. And you will again see the distinction between the righteous and the wicked between those who serve God and those who do not."" (Malachi 3:13-18 NIV)  In conclusion whether we believe it or not if America continues to define God there will come a day when even our prayers will not change the outcome of our nation's future: To Jeremiah- ""Then the Lord said to me Do not pray for the well-being of this people. Then the Lord said to me: Even if Moses and Samuel were to stand before me my heart would not go out to this people. Send them away from my presence! Let them go! (Jeremiah 14:11- 15:1 NIV) To Ezekiel-""as surely as I live declares the Sovereign Lord even if Noah Daniel and Job were in it they could save neither son nor daughter. They would save only themselves by their righteousness."" (Ezekiel 14:20 NIV) May our prayers still be effectual as we ask God to bring our nation back from the brink of destruction and allow his Glory to feel our land once more.

To all who care about their Country and the state of affairs in the United States  I am a Retired Military Officer Commissioned from Infantry Officer Candidate Candidate School Class 509 Fort Benning Georgia in 1968. I served 23 years as a Commissioned Officer and retired from the Military in 1989 to pursue other opportunities in the civilian sector. Considering how our country is currently being led by an incompetent President I pledge to support this Country and my fellow Officers who join me in publicizing the present danger of our current President Donald J. Trump. I also invite other citizens of the United States to speak up and join our protest and demand that the current President and his regime step down from their positions. In this regard I strongly support my fellow Officers who have collectively penned the letter below. If you agree with our concerns I request you copy and re-post this letter to your family and friends across our Country.  R. Scott Swingler Lieutenant Colonel U.S. Army Retired  The Letter  VOICES OF CONCERN FOR OUR IMPERILED DEMOCRACY  We the undersigned are former or retired army officers now in our seventies. We share a common bond having graduated from the U.S. Army Officer Candidate School at Ft. Benning Georgia in 1968. From there we served in the military in a variety of capacities wherever we were needed. As young men we were committed to defending Americas values our freedoms our democracy and our Constitution. Some of us made a career in the military but most of us went on to have productive careers back home in the civilian world. As a group we have diverse political views: Republicans Democrats Liberals and Conservatives. But we are all concerned Americans.  In the past few months our system of government has been increasingly under siege. Our nation has reached this critical point under the current administration of Donald J. Trump. Important voices have begun to speak out led by respected members of the highest military rank. We would like to join this chorus of alarm.  Our government structure with its co-equal branches is in jeopardy. Our judicial system is reeling. The FBI the CIA and the NSA are being mocked and belittled. Our Attorney Generals office is overtly politicized. Our State Department is being decimated. Where are the voices of outrage in Congress? The Senate is virtually mute.  We are concerned that our country is rapidly spinning toward a Presidency staffed by family members and cronies in which the only prerequisite is blind loyalty. The United States is withdrawing from the world enjoying little respect internationally. This cannot continue.  Quoting James Mattis a Marine Four Star General and former Secretary of Defense:  We know that we are better than the abuse of executive authorityWe must reject and hold accountable those in office who would make a mockery of our Constitution.  We honor the Generals courage and emphatically call on both chambers of Congress to follow his lead in defending our democracy and our Constitution. We urge all Americans to consider these ideals as you vote this Fall.  John F. Baxter III (1LT USA) A.C. (Budd) Mazurek (1LT USA) Mark T. Creaven (1LT USA) John F. McMackin Jr. (1LT USA) Larry W.

"Here is a report I received on the demonstration at W&L on April 2nd. 1) The total gathering consisted of about 100 people. This included a couple of photographers a camera man and curious onlookers. It also included several adults including some faculty members. Probably there were not more than 75 students in attendance. I think this number is probably closer to the number of hard core activists than the 300 or so reported at the walk out the other day. Remember that the other day there was a walk out and several students felt the pressure to attend from their professors and fellow students. 2) I got there at 12:30 and stayed for about an hour. I didn't see any student leaders there. They had about 10 or so speakers during that time including 3 faculty members. One of these was Toni Locey another was George Bent and another was someone whose name I didn't catch. This woman and Locey were outrageous in their comments- throwing around terms like ""white supremacy"" and ""racist"" to apply to the vast majority of white people in America. The other woman was very much against the Greek system declaring it an instrument of white supremacy and white oppression. By the way I didn't see any members of the administration there. 3) The students who spoke were sincere but some of them were misguided and lacked knowledge of the history of the University and those who made it great. I do think there is an obligation to make the University as diverse and inclusive as possible but disagree with many of their solutions. Many of these students just felt a greater need to belong to the W&L community. I think there is an obligation to work on that and that the idea of making the Greek system more inclusive would go a long way toward achieving that goal. 4) The Generals Redoubt was mentioned in a derogatory way more than once both by faculty members and students. 5) There was campus security around but they were pretty much removed from the action. The speakers were in front of the Lee Chapel as they were the other day but nothing on the door and no apparent threat to the Chapel. 6) As I was leaving the campus I saw a number of students on Washington and Lee streets walking around and having a good time as if nothing was going on and who couldn't care less about the demonstration.  One thing which George Bent said did resonate with me. He said that if the University didn't change it would be left in the dust. I agree but again my solution is different from his. I want to see us recruit as diverse a student body as possible but I want those who come to our school to respect our history values and traditions and be fully qualified for admission. The same is true of the faculty. I want a President who also respects our namesakes and will provide true leadership.  Another person commented... that ideas about what diversity means is a complex matter because definitions of diversity vary. I think the University Administration and student recruiters have become myopic about their VERY narrow concept of diversity throwing money at students who may not be interested in attending a Southern rural college but who because of financial demands accept the scholarship money. I think this practice has led to an unhappy segment of the student population because these students may not be given a clear idea (from college recruiters) of student life in Lexington and the prominence of the Greek system before they decide to attend among other characteristics. In short I suspect recruiters are selling a bill of goods that may not accurately reflect Washington and Lee student life... and that is largely the cause of student unrest among these uninformed diversity recruits.",political,Facebook
Here's what I have for tomorrow morning: Welcome- Ladies and Gentlemen Friends and Family. Good morning. Our great Country stands for Life Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness. We are known throughout history as Warriors of Freedom. We ARE America. They say- there's no place like home. And that's the truth. If anything were to happen to Our amazing Land of the Free- No One is going to airdrop food medicine or ammunition. No One will come to Our rescue within the hour. Why? Because we stand on Our own two feet and always have. We always will. If we don't do it the job doesn't get done. We make the first move. And no matter what occurs the enemy will NOT prevail on Our soil within Our Homeland. This was proven 21 years ago on this very morning. On September 11th in 2001 Our home suffered a series of attacks from a desperate torn unprecedented group of people. You see Our Country's people believe in protecting Our own. Al Queda believes in their own manifested lies without regard to life. That morning we tried to protect Our own first and Patriotism shone through the darkness. The United States pilots the civilian family members on those planes going down showed the courage and selfless service to prevent further fatalities from occurring on our Homeland. The deeper the darkness the greater the Light shines in the end. We value Life we protect our Liberties so that we may pursue Happiness. Today we remember Our fallen. Our family members our friends Our courageous fire fighters and first responders who go by many titles. We Honor ALL 8000 military Service Members who gave the ultimate sacrifice over the past 21 years to prevent Al Queda and remaining terrorist organizations from ever coming back on US soil. We Honor all Our Coalition Forces who came from friendly countries who helped us in the early years of war in Iraq and Afghanistan. Today we Honor ALL those who lead the way; from every era and every conflict before Veterans and Supporters alike. They protected the rights and the ability for us to continue to do so today. Because of those who lead the way- we have the most powerful educated unmatched military forces in the world. And if the enemy EVER tries to strike again May God help them. We do it for All we've lost we do it for each other we are 1 America and if Our backs are against the Wall- we will do it again. My name is Ret SSG Jill Main-Paterson. I was stationed in Fort Carson CO on September 11th. I was off duty that day. I'm sure everyone will always remember where they were what they were doing and how they felt that morning- how YOU felt. I was holding my 3 children in my arms in the front yard crying and praying in disbelief. Thank you for your time and attention to hear these words today. I will be followed by Comrade in Arms- Chris Henningsen.

"Why Do I Self-Identify as a Liberal Republican especially these days?  A friend asked me this again today.  So thought I would reshare this post (slightly edited) from the www.theloneliberalrepublican.org website.  This whole quixotic project is geared towards tilling ground to restore the Republican Party to the balance it has had through most of its historynot RINO politics just what the Republican Party has actually been historically.  For many of us who regard ourselves as somewhere in the middle politically I believe that there are two major issues that separate most who would identify as Republicans from those who would identify as Democrats.  The first is whether we regard the government or the private sector as more capable of handling most problems with Republicans generally arguing for private sector solutions and Democrats leaning to government ones. I identify as a Liberal Republican because I believe that good public education and public safety (national defense and domestic policing and incarceration) are best handled by the government but most else like housing and job creation are better handled by the private sector. I believe that government regulation is important but should be simple clear and enforceable. Regulation that provides a feeding frenzy for lawyers and lobbyists is highly problematic and often counterproductive. In contrast to these Liberal Republican views my Democrat friends are much more likely to be suspicious of business and see the government as having a much bigger role in an ideal society such as providing housing and jobs and regulating comprehensively and heavily.  The second issue that separates those of us who are somewhere in the political middle but regard ourselves ideologically as Liberal Republicans rather than as Democrats is what we mean when we advocate for equality. Do we mean equality of opportunity with a strong social safety net (a liberal Republican view) or do we mean relative equality of where we all end up economically (the traditional social democratic view)?  While it is commonplace to say that America is the land of broad opportunity this has been changing in America for a while now. That is a tragedy. The data increasingly demonstrates that we are now doing a poor job as a nation of providing clear paths to upward mobility. This is in part because of things like globalization and technology but also in part because we have had few effective government strategies to promote upward mobility. And one of the reasons we have few effective strategies in addition to our gridlocked government is the muddled mess most of our politicians make of the issue. For example President Obama's 2013 Osawatomie Kansas speech beautifully focused on equality of opportunity rather than equality of results. But the conversation quickly shifted to talking about the one percenters which is much more about equality of result than equality of opportunity. A LOT more Americans will support proactive government policies that are laser focused on equality of opportunity than policies that seek to achieve equality of result. After all part of the American Dream can be summarized in the famous quote ""Socialism never took root in America because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires.""  Over a billion additional people around the world are now living lives that resemble variations of our consumer-oriented middle class society. This is the first time in history many have had the opportunity to affect their and their family's futures so materially relatively unencumbered by a repressive government or by their own beliefs that it is their fate to live the impoverished life they were born to. Billions more aspire to lead such lives and are studying and working very very hard towards such goals. That's a lot of energy out there around the globe with more countries joining this club every decade.  This happy change towards American Dream self-help values around the world is to be celebrated. But it also limits America's policy options in ways that make a Liberal Republican focus on equality of opportunity with a strong safety net much more achievable than the social democratic policies that prevail in much of Western Europe and are supported by many in the Democratic Party today.  Thoughts? Constructive ones much appreciated. Rants and gifs of feces...enough already not just on this Facebook page but in American political life. It may be cathartic but its not helpful.

Good morning America!!! A common theme Ive heard since first contemplating this campaign is you better clean up that Facebook. You wont see any of that from me. What you see is what you get. This common perception that politicians are mystical creatures who have done no wrong and live up on a pedestal is simply untrue. Humans were born into sin (mistakes). We either learn from them and grow or we dont. I said from the beginning were doing this differently. I live my life in the open and always will. You will always know where I stand.  I am a man who has sinned plenty and who is still constantly growing. I promised not to be a typical politician and I wont be. I wont be a fake figure kids think they have to aspire to be. I will be proof that your children can make mistakes and grow from them. My wife wont hit the campaign trail covered from head to toe in turtle necks. I encourage her to rock her curves and I encourage our young son to not objectify women based on how they dress. Ill never be the father out rocking my flabby dad bod while telling my daughters to cover up and not wear makeup. If you want a true outsider youve found him.

Fear is the weapon that the liberal left will use to manipulate you into doing something that you normally would not stand for.

America isnt the greatest country anymore. The year 2020 has done more to prove this than any other time in history. Having spoken to those from a different time read books letters along with articles from back when and having studied Americas history it sure sounds like at one time America was great. Men had this idea of Freedom  and in todays world that freedom has been grossly misinterpreted and abused. This nation was founded with Morals and stood up for what was right. We cared about our neighbors and sacrificed. We didnt let who we voted for define us and allow us to become so separated from one another.  This year alone its been nothing but hatred fear and disrespect. People from other nations at one point dreamed of coming to America and now I can only imagine that dream would be a nightmare. In the past year Riots having taken place and have been reduce from the disgrace they are to the simple term Protest. This has taken part in both sides now those against America and those for America. I agree there should be an uprising but America needs a Moral uprising. America needs God and sadly He doesnt seem to be of any importance lately.  I remember the days following September 11th 2001 and how our nation became whole again. The color of skin didnt matter. Who we voted for didnt matter. Police firemen medical professionals and many others were all loved. Now less than twenty years later this country is more divided than ever. The media has done the best it ever has with showing a false America and by telling the people who they are and what they should think. There is no personal responsibility anymore. There is an excuse for everyone in some fashion. Americans need to become a proud people a people that other nations respect and a people of God. We need to find our core values. Integrity Responsibility Respect and Servant leadership.  Respect require empathy consideration and the willingness to help others. Our founding fathers wanted to create something worth creating. A something that could endure the rest of time. A something for all people to be proud of. They were hungry for a freedom that didnt exist they were passionate in decision making for tough problems and new challenges they were sure to face. They wanted a nation to be able to vote for those who would use good judgement for the nation so that we didnt have to make cumbersome rules or processes that would belittle the people. Everything was laid out by our founding fathers.  Today many use the constitution as leverage to get their way by misinterpreting it. The constitution is breaking down more and more in ways our fathers thought they had guarded against. Now with our nation in such moral decay Im not sure anything short of the grace of God can rectify what has become of this not so great nation that so many fought and died for. Was all of that courage that was laid down on the battlefields done so in vain?  I remember growing up and seeing my elders wearing their hats and pins with pride. They saluted the flag each time it flew with pride and did so with honor. Now some twenty plus years later that same flag is offensive. A flag that stood for honor peace justice and hope. A flag that stood for freedom. That flag is spit on stomped into the ground and burned on a daily basis. We need to pray hard for this country before there isnt an America to pray for.  -Haynes-,political,Facebook
July 14 2021 | Statement Regarding TFRW and the CRT debate  Thank you to all who acted on our alert regarding the Texas Federation of Republican Women and the issue of Critical Race Theory (CRT). Thank you for sharing your concerns with TFRW and with us.  TFRW leadership believes they hold the correct position. We understand that and appreciate the message we received from them last evening.  We believe that TFRW believes that it is fighting to end CRT indoctrination in the schools in all subjects. We do.  However we have several respected Texas Conservative Grassroots Coalition Leaders with decades of experience in researching and opposing the social engineering in education and the social justice cultural assault by the Left and Progressive Right. These women believe TFRWs leadership is not correct simply because it is missing some information.  In addition to credible information sent to us by these highly respected longtime conservative leaders the conservative publication National Review has written two critical pieces on TFRWs position  one on April 7 and a new article published just yesterday (7/13/21). That is a problem for TFRW and we understand WHY they are naturally upset by those articles.  Grassroots Americas goal is to get this sorted out so that we are ALL focused on rooting out CRT wherever it is and removing its influence in every form. Cultural Marxism is dangerous to our children to our military and to Liberty.  Cultural Marxism is not a right-wing conspiracy. It is real evil and deadly. Because we all care about Texas future generations and their Liberty we are willing to go the distance to make sure CRT is stopped.  Whats the solution?  Grassroots Americas goal is to bring the differing leaders together to discuss the facts in a deliberate respectful civil manner. We hope to reach an understanding and end up on the same page. We hope the result is that we are all better equipped to stop this assault on our children society government agencies and even our military.  We have offered to put a private meeting together between the involved parties and believe that all desire to participate in a good faith effort. We need to talk and listen.  We ask you to join us in praying for this collaborative effort to work through our differences for the good of Texas and the demise of CRT.

"This government is so incompetent. After 20 years of war and the death of our men and women in arms we left Afghanistan. This added over two trillion dollars of debt to the economy. This was the longest war in US history. I agree that we should not get into endless wars. But leaving the way we did will pave the way for the Taliban to take over the country in a matter of months at most. After 20 years we should have made a deal with them with some fundamental agreements. Thousands of innocent Afghanis will be slaughtered particularly those on the side of the Afghani government who worked with the Americans. The Afghan army is no match for the Taliban ! Now the Chinese have already stepped in with a ""helping hand"" and are making good with the the Taliban delegation who went to China. The US Secretary of State the brilliant Antony Blinken has said that ""China's possible involvement in Afghanistan could be "" a positive thing "". He said this after Taliban representatives visited China. He urged the Taliban to come to the ""negotiating table.....peacefully"". This is the mentality of this government and this Secretary of State. The Taliban have already increased their violence and taken over large parts of the country. I have no words to describe the incompetence and the total inept leadership of this country. ""FAILURE"" is written on every level of governing inside and outside the country.

The U.S. Supreme Court upheld peoples First Amendment rights in AFPF v Bonta. This case brought together nearly 300 groups from a diversity of perspectives and representing a range of issues including health faith civil rights and racial justice among others. When a state makes a blanket demand for a list of an organizations supporters it creates an unacceptable risk to those peoples right to join together with one another and violates the privacy necessary to protect that right. We applaud the Court's decision and what it means for non-profits across the country and the millions of Americans who support them.  Joining forces with others whether publicly or privately has always been a key part of Americas forward march toward realizing our founding ideals. From the Federalist Papers to the Civil Rights Movement to important causes today people have banded together to demand a better way - opening the door to progress time and again. Their identities were far less important than their ideas and because they had the right to keep the former private the latter transformed America.,political,Facebook

I liked Rush Limbaugh. I did not just like him because of his conservative views most of which I share. I liked him for many reasons but most of all because he was a voice of reason and common sense. He was a decent man and human being. I liked him because he loved his country America and knew of the exceptionalism of America. Our condolences to his family and to all his followers and to those who recognize the difference condolences to America. We lost a good man and a true patriot. Rest in peace Rush !,political,Facebook

FROM MOVEMENT TO MOVEMENT: But will there be change?  We are firmly in the transition away from the Trump era to the Biden era or so it seems. The Biden movement is a flashback to a former time: the growth era of a capitalist cycle which if it does not provide everyone's needs at least inspires belief in the possibility of meeting those needs. This is enough for most people. But in the U.S. we are in the dying stages of the capitalist order. Hope has dissipated competition has divided us into the haves and the have-nots.  Both the Biden movement and the Trump movement are reactionary movements: both wish to return us to a former place. The losing movement the Trump movement perhaps provides a glimpse of what lies ahead. It is afterall the child the outgrowth of the former idealized version of the capitalist myth which Joe Biden represents.  Joe Biden likes to speak of possibilities. Possibilities define his view of America. Foundational to this view is that these possibilities are rooted in the capitalist economic order. That somehow possibilities are not achievable in a state sector that somehow talent ambition ingenuity can only thrive when dollar bill's are waived in front of the participants this is the capitalist way.  Yet the same talent ambition and ingenuity exists without the lure of the dollar. Capitalism however has convinced us the fulfillment of these traits is only achievable when abundantly awarded through wealth and income. History however has taught us otherwise. Greatness is achievable through beliefs and incentives other than money. We need to look no further than the teacher the soldier the athlete the artist the nurse the social worker: most of whom are inspired by something other than money. These aspirants are inspired by other ideals and greatness is often achieved among them.  Biden's inaugural address was based on the ideal of cooperation. It was moving it was hopeful it is what many of us socialist have called for for many years: a cooperative world which seeks to meet the needs of all people. And herein lies the problem. While Biden calls for cooperation undoubtedly a sincere expression of his desires the Nation is wedded to an economic order based not on cooperation but on competition. Competition is foundational to the capitalist order; it is structural embedded in the financial framework of the private firm it is glorified it creates winners and losers.  Cooperation and possibilities are noble traits and inspirations but they are undermined by a capitalist ideology which glorifies competition and wealth. Cooperation which Biden seeks conflicts with the capitalist order. It is a great contradiction which we will need to adress otherwise the future will not look much differ than the present.,political,Facebook
"Americans don't have a problem believing in or even trusting science we struggle believing in and trusting scientist these days including political scientist.  We don't have a problem with politics just politicians. Tens of millions of Americans use medicine daily and spend billions of dollars doing so. Hundreds of millions regularly vote for or against something or someone both officially and unofficially as well.  Both scientist and politicians are human beings ""being"" human just as the rest of us are. Any and all so called ""professionals"" are role players as are we all whether parents children siblings spouses priests peasants Presidents or paupers. We're all involved in habitual role playing which is a normal human proclivity and function. We're are now very conspicuously being confronted with the depth of incivility sensitivity bigotry cruelty and violence even some of the most sincere religious and supposedly well intentioned people humans can sink. Humanity at large needs to and indeed in being upgraded as a species. I know it looks frightening but there can be no full evolution without varying aspects of dissolution. America like the rest of the world is at a crossroad. The universe itself is in transition and at a critical and pivotal intersection in ways that causes people to feel tense and insecure.  Growth and expansion demands change and won't tolerate stagnation. Some things must dissolve dissipate and ultimately disappear both symptoms and source as the universe corrects itself. We must all make manage and ultimately master change. Stay focused pliable purposeful and as peaceful as possible. Pause with poise. Contemplate with conviction sincerity and serenity.

The City of Ashland's Board of Alderman is a non-partisan non-paying local city council elected position for the term of two years. In a 4th class city such as the City of Ashland the role of the Board of Alderman is to be the policy making body of the city government and must follow general law.  The focus of the role of an Alderman is local level only and must adhere to all laws and regulations. The Board of Alderman do not have any authority nor do issues such as gun rights and the 2nd Amendment fall under the purview of the Board of Alderman yet these are questions being asked as a qualifier for endorsement by people in positions of influence. Topics such as these are addressed at the state and national levels. As the mother of three sons who actively serve in the United States Army and who have each served multiple deployments I know the importance of the Constitution of the United States of America because my sons defend it every day and their families sacrifice along with them. We have been fortunate to not hold the title of a Gold Star family but that does not mean that my sons haven't served unscathed protecting our Constitutional rights.  As we get closer to the election it is important to understand the role of an Alderman the limitations of their power and their awesome responsibilities in unconditionally serving the people of their ward and the City of Ashland on a whole. This role must be held with the utmost of integrity. Do not be misled by red herrings false promises or the false ability to work outside of the powers and responsibilities of an Alderman.  The time is now to bring about the change the residents of Ashland have been asking for. Elect someone who understands how government works who thinks with vision and who will not make false promises but will do everything in her power to make Ashland a great place to live work and shop for everyone.  I humbly ask for your vote on April 6th. Elect Elisabeth Sobczak as your Ward 3 Alderwoman.,political,Facebook
"Freedom Does Not Guarantee Liberty The liberty to freely do whats right not just what we are free to do is the essence of Kingdom Living. This is why all government systems have failed throughout history to bring peace even in so-called Democratic systems. No matter what rights are given the self-centered nature of mankind will continue to demand more even if they violate natural law or even the commandments of their creator. Our American system is without question the best system of government ever conceived. It has brought freedom and prosperity to hundreds of millions. Our Constitution guards our individual freedoms like no other system in history although Amendments have been added to acknowledge its early shortcomings. Unfortunately the focus on freedom and rights has allowed a minority to influence legislators and complicit courts to add rights which our founders never imagined  and God does not endorse. Statue of Liberty or Statue of Freedoms? Americas example of freedom the best in history nevertheless has fallen short of our calling both spiritually and culturally. Our Statue of Liberty could be better named ""Statue of Freedom"" or ""Statue of Rights"". The flesh too often still rules. ""For you brethren have been called to liberty; only do not use liberty as an opportunity for the flesh but through love serve one another. For all the law is fulfilled in one word even in this: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. (Galatians 5:13-14) In America we have many so-called rights which may be perfectly legal and even culturally acceptable for many. However our freedom to exercise these rights do not necessarily represent righteousness or right living according to Gods standards. True liberty is a far higher calling to achieve than simply obtaining freedom or rights  TRUE LIBERTY means we freely do the right thing. The American Covenant Many believe that our founding fathers entered into a covenant with God just as Abraham did for the nation of Israel. Americas covenant with God and its people was written in the Constitution. However until our country fought and died to end slavery and finally added the Thirteenth Amendment it could not fulfill its purpose and destiny. At the core of both covenants with God was the elimination of slavery which was a violation of the purpose for which God created man  to be made into His image with His dominion. We Have ALL Been Slaves - Truth Sets Us ALL Free We can remove all the monuments from American history regarding the stain of slavery but offenses will remain without a change of hearts minds and spirits. We must ALL recognize that no matter our color or ethnicity political position or gender we are ALL victims of SLAVERY  since our heritage includes the sin of Adam. We can remain SLAVES to sin or we can be set free by TRUTH. They answered Him We are Abrahams descendants and have never been in bondage to anyone. How can You say You will be made free? Jesus answered them Most assuredly I say to you whoever commits sin is a SLAVE of sin. And a slave does not abide in the house forever but a son abides forever. ""Therefore if the Son makes you free you shall be free indeed.""(John 8:33-36) Freely Bound by Sonship Rather than slaves to sin or even to restraining legalism as SONS (and DAUGHTERS) of God we DESIRE to please our Father. We know that our redemption is for a higher purpose than simply going to Heaven  We are given the GRACE to preach truth to those in bondage and to proclaim LIBERTY. Spiritually one can obtain LIBERTY even if under tyrannical rulers or bound in chains. ""The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;"" (Isaiah 61:1) Note that the Prophet Isaiah did not proclaim FREEDOM but LIBERTY for the captives. There is a difference which could make all the difference in the world in building the Kingdom of God on earth  as it is in Heaven. America is the greatest bastion of freedom ever known but has not always been the Shining City on a Hill that our founding fathers envisioned  The focus on freedoms to do what one feels and then legislate social justice rights has often violated Natural or Biblical Law. This trend does not advance LIBERTY nor represent the intent of our founding fathers or Constitution. In fact progressive and socialist politics continue to erode the clear intent to honor our creator above mans self-interest. The result has been an increasingly lawless atheistic even hedonistic culture. Political correctness safe spaces in academia and even major media and tech company social networks threaten to undermine our most fundamental foundations including free speech religious freedoms the right to bear arms and even life itself for the unborn in the womb. Yet this trend can be reversed if we return to the Biblical truths regarding liberty and true unity. ""There is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither bond nor free there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus."" (Galatians 3:28) ""Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.""(Galatians 5:1) "" where the Spirit of the Lord is there is liberty. (2 Corinthians 3:17)"" EXCERPTS from The Last Seal of the King by Gary L. Cobb",political,Facebook
"The state of this world is getting scary. It's unfortunate that many do not see it.  Millions are marching around the world in protest every weekend against COVID-19 lockdowns vaccine mandates and the removal of civil rights liberties and freedoms. With at least a hundred thousand protesting in cities and towns around Australia.  ""If you forget the past you are doomed to repeat it."" ""I don't agree with what you say but I'll give my life defending your right to say it.""  Two very important statements the kids of today are not being taught. Free speech is something the whole world needs. Even racist hatred and down right evil things need to be allowed to be said. Gives us the opportunity to hit back through words NOT violence.  Let's start with Covid-19:  The fear being pushed by politicians and the media about COVID-19 is out of control. No I am not one of those that think COVID-19 is a hoax. COVID-19 is real. As I read once: Do I believe that people are getting sick? Yes. Do I believe that people are dying? Yes. Do I believe some hospitals are overrun? Yes. Do I believe nurses and healthcare workers are terrified? Yes. Do I believe China is lying about it's numbers? Yes. Do I believe COVID-19 was made in a lab? Yes. Do I believe China is responsible? Yes. Do I believe COVID-19 is being politicized? Yes. Do I believe COVID-19 is being used to strip Americans and Australians of their rights? Yes. Do I believe there's a bigger picture than what politicians and the media are telling us? Yes. Do I believe this is more about power and control than anything else? Yes. Do I believe we as Australians just set a dangerous precedent for our freedoms? Yes... and I am much more terrified of that than any virus.  Am I an anti-vaxxer? No I am 100% for vaccines. Myself and my family are all vaccinated for everything except for the COVID-19 vaccine. No I do not plan to get the COVID-19 Vaccine. I will not inject a vaccine into my body that is being forced upon me. Especially a vaccine that was ready in less than a year. It takes at least 5 years to fully test a vaccine. We do NOT know the long term side effects yet. I am Anti-MANDATORY vaccine I am not Anti-Vaccine. Take the vaccine if you want I support you decision to take it. But don't force it on me.  I do not believe in lockdowns or mask mandates. We lived with Influenza (a virus that had a confirmed 0.13% death rate for the years 2016-2017) for generations without mask mandates or lockdowns. I used 2016-2017 because they are the latest years where the numbers are confirmed: COVID-19 is far more deadly for over 60's than Influenza particularly those with underlying conditions with a death rate of about 0.66%. However When you account for elderly patients dying to COVID-19 without an underlying condition that death rate drops to 0.2%. Compared to the 0.08% Death rate for under 60's with COVID-19 dropping further the younger the bracket. The Delta variant is less deadly but more contagious. Please note I am talking about the death rate (Your chance to die if you get infected) not number of deaths. These numbers are based from the CDC's own words that 90% of COVID-19 cases will go completely undetected as most of the population is asymptomatic to the COVID-19 Virus. All this information can be found on the CDC website.  Now while the death rate is higher than influenza in the older generation. This is no reason to completely shut down a country even at the high end of 0.66%. No one wants to even talk about the rising rate of ""Self harm"" especially in teenagers due to lockdowns. These lockdowns are causing far more damage than they are preventing Not just in ""self harm"" rates. Source:  Next Abortion:  Abortion is getting out of control. The latest data from Planned Parenthood states that over 98%... YES OVER 98% of the reasons given for Abortion is ""Unwanted Baby"". Less than 2% is due to Rape / Incest. 2 reasons that are the only time I ever agree with Abortion and ONLY before a heartbeat. Source:  Both men and women need to take some responsibility for your own actions. If you cannot afford / want to bring a baby into the world then Wrap it Swallow it Flush it Throw it or just say no. But please STOP using Abortion as a contraceptive. Stop killing babies because you couldn't keep your pants zipped up. I accept that accidents happen but that's the risk you take when you say yes. Deal with the consequences of your actions.  And now for the US itself:  The US is being run by a senile dementia ridden old fart controlled by special interest groups in the hopes of turning America into a communist dictatorship. The Left leaning Mainstream Media is complicit in this they regularly distort the truth to push their own agenda. Notice they are not reporting on the Phone call between President Biden and the Afghan President Ashraf Ghani. A phone call that if it happened under President Trump He would be rightfully impeached before the media could even report on it.  In this phone call President Biden's own words pressured President Ghani to distort the truth: President Biden to President Ghani: ""And theres a need whether it is true or not there is a need to project a different picture."" Source:  This is not the first time President Biden has pressured another country to help him politically: Then Vice-President Biden with President Obama's backing threatened to withhold aid money if a prosecutor that was investigating the company Hunter Biden was working at was not fired. Source from then Vice-President Biden's own lips:   There are multiple other examples of corruption lies and propaganda by the Biden administration and it's buddies in the media. However this post will become a novel if I continue. Follow me for more examples in future posts.  And finally Australia:  Australia itself is sliding down a dark path. Our country is done as we know it if the population doesn't wake up and soon.  Queensland is opening a concentration camp in the center of the state. Source:  Victoria is the next communist China puppet state. Led by a known Communist supporter. Source: Multiple other articles showing the corruption of Daniel Andrews.  The Federal Government just passed a spy bill. Allowing them to access our phones and upload or delete data at will. Source:  The media around the world doesn't even care that Australia has begun a process to strip its citizens of what little rights we had. I fear that most Australians have forgotten what happened 80 years ago. We don't even have the means to defend ourselves any more they are scared another Eureka Stockade will happen.  It is time for Australians to take a stand. It is time for us to take our country back but we need help. We need the world to care about what is currently taking place in Australia.  Australia must ditch the crown. We must become a Constitutional Federal Republic. We do not have a Bill of Rights that needs to change. We deserve our freedom. But we must earn it first.

"As many of our customers and friends have been asking for more information on the conflict in the Middle East we wanted to share some thoughts.  In short we must support Israel and pray for its safety and standing as the sole Jewish nation on Earth.  Israel and the Jewish people remain under attack. Both from the rockets of Hamas and in the court of public opinion. Despite thousands of rockets being fired by the terrorists Hamas from the Gaza Strip members of the mainstream media continually attack Israel's right to defend itself and assail its right to exist.  It is hard to believe Israel's legitimacy is still challenged considering the long connection between the Jewish people and Israel the Promised Land given by God to Abraham. Charles Krauthammer once wrote that Israel ""is the only nation on earth that inhabits the same land bears the same name speaks the same language and worships the same God that it did 3000 years ago.""  Additionally Israel stands up for the values that we as Americans treasure including democracy freedom tolerance and the rule of law. Yet throughout the ""progressive"" movement and on college campuses across the world Israel is presented as evil or worse.  Protestors demand its destruction and attack Jews in the street. Their anti-Semitism is disgusting and their hypocracy is abhorrent.  Why does Israel need to justify its existence? Every other country in the world would use every means at its disposal to keep its people safe. America wouldn't hesitate to defend itself. Nor should Israel. Sadly it is held to a different standard. Israel is routinely the only nation that is criticized for its self defense. Israel has even given back land it has taken. But the mainstream media and progressives refuse to see facts and are blinded by their hatred.  At the same time the mainstream media largely ignores anything remotely negative about the Palestinians. For instance Hamas targets civilians and does not care if anything happens to their own people. Why? Because they know that their apologists in the mainstream media will portray them as victims even though they are the aggressors.  Israel goes out of its way to protect and preserve human life. Yet it is the subject of more condemnation than any other nation in the world even the worst human rights abusers such as Syria China and North Korea.  While we pray for the safety and security of every human life we must recognize that Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East and the only Jewish state in the world. Sadly peace is not yet an option for Israel. The destruction of Israel is in the Charter of Hamas. If Israel were to put down their arms tomorrow the nation would swiftly be wiped from the map by its enemies.  Yet if the Palestinians were to put down their arms there would be peace. How do we know this? Israel unilaterally and voluntarily withdrew from the Gaza Strip more than 15 years ago. Israel wants peace. And when the Palestinians are ready to make a genuine peace Israel will be a willing partner. In fact each time Israel has offered peace the Palestinians have turned it down.  Until peace arrives we as Americans should be grateful to Israel for leading the charge against terrorism and for being the strongest ally the United States could hope for.  Please join us in sending prayers for the safety and security of Israel and the Jewish people in these challenging times. My God protect and defend Israel as the eternal home of the Jewish people forever.  Am Yisrael Chai!",political,Facebook

Our children deserve better August 26 2021 Letter to the Editor The Citizen  I attended the WBL School Board meeting on Aug. 9 and believe what I witnessed at this board meeting is NOT representative of the majority of this community.  The meeting started out with Superintendent Kazmierczak reading an addendum to public forum procedures to ensure an orderly way for stakeholders to share their perspective and voice opinions. The room was packed with concerned citizens. While many seemed interested in the actual business of the meeting others were not.  There was a group of attendees that were loud disruptive angry rude disrespectful and refused to follow civil protocol. I witnessed one woman yelling from the side of the room with a look of rage on her face simply because someone could not hear. One gentleman walked through the room yelling comments. Another gentleman used the podium to announce his school board candidacy yelled God Bless America and saluted the audience.  Sadly public forum comments were forced to end due to continued outbursts. Others who wished to address the board were unable to do so. After causing significant disruption many of these attendees proceeded to walk out before the meetings next agenda item: academic programming which seemed contrary to their demands for transparency and their expressed concern about students and their learning.  Schools have been exceptionally challenged over the past 18 months. COVID restrictions and school closure decisions were passed down from all levels of government and landed at the feet of our local school leaders. Everyone in the community has different views on what the right decisions are for masking school closures and addressing racial equity issues in our schools yet no one perspective is the only perspective and all who wish to voice their views at board meetings should feel safe and respected in doing so.  I encourage all to attend in support of our students and our school leaders at the next board meeting on Sep. 13 at 5:30 p.m. to better understand both the good things happening and the challenges faced.  Our children are watching and they deserve better.  Chris Streiff Oji  Retired principal and school board candidate  Hugo,political,Facebook
Reverse Course  The Captain of the ship in the American wheelhouse needs to call out Reverse Course or else the United States is heading closer and closer to the drop of an economic waterfall to which much damage will be inflicted.  The combination of an unsustainable $30 Trillion in debt and a soon to be $4 Trillion more plus a manufacturing base that has all but been hollowed out and sold to China is spelling out in shining red flashing letters stop this insanity and wake up from this self imposed hypnotic trance that all is well and Reverse Course!  But what course should we reverse to?  We need a complete reversal of policy on American manufacturing and begin to re-build that infrastructure throughout the United States but this time with a focus on smaller niche manufacturing hubs in small towns and rural America.  Yes Artificial Intelligence (AI) is replacing many manufacturing jobs but there are still jobs that only humans can do and there must be an intelligent plan of action that outlines a blueprint for American growth and prosperity that can be set in motion and accomplished by 2032.  We need to take action now and recapture the American ideals and values that made us who we are.  China has a revenue and savings base of $45 Trillion dollars that are now being unleashed throughout many parts of the world to build infrastructure in many developing countries. They will very probably soon demand that all exports and imports be transacted in Chinese Renminbi currency and back that currency by gold and this could have dire economic consequences to the dollar as the worlds reserve currency.  No military can save us from economic defeat for a shot need not even be fired in such a scenario. We must reverse course and return to sound monetary policy to build the industrial base in this country. Social programs are important but without real productive growth our economy can not be sustained through the printing of Trillions of dollars. This is not real growth. It is fake growth. We need to reverse course. Now.,political,Facebook

Then as now this is a stage of human apostasy when everyone is impressed with their ability to injure each! Governmental leadership inscribes laws upon stone for vindictive purposes as people steal plunder even drag each other into court just to bear false witness calling their lawlessness Justice and the laws written by those they bribe in order to do their bidding moral. In the end these people became the booty and the prey snatched up in a day!! There is always the bigger dog in the neighborhood to bite and devour:  15 But if you bite and devour one another beware lest you be consumed by one another! (Gal. 5:15 NKJ)  Today we face legislation that is framed in the generalities of promises bribes to given sectors of populations never with any inkling or statement as to how those promises will be accomplished. To be sure its nothing more than a great power grab which our President calls the transformation of America. Frankly I believe a great transformation IS about to take place in American political leadership arresting and prosecuting criminal elements of Democrat leadership and this by a military tribune at the courthouse built recently in the Guantanamo Bay Cuba facility. Their crimes are publicly known to all and have been so for at least 4 to 10 years!.  THESIS .. The painfully stupid and their painfully stupid behavior is grievous even to contemplate much less write about. Besides the fact their mechanical predictability makes it utterly BORING!! Poor Rush! That was so much of his otherwise very insightful commentary. Now they just tell us everything we already know! Even conservative media dutifully reporting the corruption day in and day out includes commentary on already well known corruption in some of its most intricate details! It becomes impossible to sit through and so frustrating to hear repeated! ROFL! My guess we are at the very tail end of this nonsense even in heaven!!! I can practically hear the angels in heaven screaming the same complaints perhaps even for the actors to be removed and the curtain close on another chapter in the angelic conflict as well. .. YEAH! ITS CALLED PLAYING GOD .. Making grand promises decreeing what will be thinking your power determines the future but never committing to how one gets from A to B so as to deceive those promised is the height of incompetence in government and much more so in ones personal life. It has injured the poor for the past 50 years who themselves see the fraud. .. In our passage we have an explicit warning made by Isaiah to the leadership of Israel in this regard both northern and southern kingdoms. The articular qal participle from  (Chaqaq) means to inscribe or engrave as law was often recorded in stone or clay tablets. This common practice was done with GREAT AUTHORITY and a very future looking view for all to read and observe unlike our judicial system. However both illustrate a pernicious power grab. To say the least Ephraims leadership was never authorized to qualify the Mosaic law much less build their own Temple and authorize another priesthood!! .. In the same fashion our body of laws regard nobody but lawyers able to understand and interpret our legislation and in no way representing the American electorate at the federal level but powers only given to the several states. Our legislators dont even read it themselves before they pass it! Worse politicians use arbitrary promisory language empowering bureaucracies to generate a plethora of regulations that no one person could ever possibly track! But subjugating a society under such rules of THEIR interpretation is what a society deserves ignorant of their Constitution  the real problem! (Even Law schools commonly do not teach the Constitution!) This capricious (lawless) power grab continues to exempt the politician from claims and promises they cannot possibly keep. Worse we have a tax code that is even MORE confusing while the government has taken it upon themselves to ignore the Constitution altogether and deem us guilty until proven innocent! This is third world tinpot behavior from which millions flee as they crash our borders!!! .. These same words   translated sorrow and (stupid) suffering are used by Job the oldest book of the Old Testament in a single verse: .. 6 For affliction  does not come from the dust Nor does trouble  spring from the ground; Yet man is born to trouble As the sparks fly upward. ""But as for me I would seek God And to God I would commit my cause--Who does great things and unsearchable Marvelous things without number. He gives rain on the earth and sends waters on the fields. (Job 5:6-10 NKJ) .. This has always been a summary statement of the Scriptures for futtilis hominem the worthless futility of mankind later expanded upon by King Solomon in Ecclesiastes. Concise and in a nutshell this the Bible warns of this behavior in the oldest book in the Bible to all who would ignore it to detriment of their mental and moral health. Nonetheless  is used throughout the Torah to describe the horrific and needless suffering of Israel resulting in severe divine discipline and ultimate removal from the Land of Promise . .. . Again Isaiah combines the two usages to more clearly define the process taking place in our verse 1: 4 No one calls for justice Nor does any plead for truth. They trust in empty words and speak lies; They conceive evil  and bring forth iniquity  (Isa. 59:4 NKJ) .. For the past 50 years the faux war cry of the Marxist has always been tax the rich. Its all about the corruption of corporations specifically the ooooiil industry that makes so much muoooney. That propaganda works for the governmental apparatchik because it draws attention away from their graft and corruption as they engage with these same corporations to accept campaign contributions!. To be sure it has nothing to do with political ideologies. They are simply there to enrich themselves as they have done for so many years. But their actions have always at all times been at the expense of the poor particularly the inner-city poor who vote to soak the rich. Their poverty is now epic and staggering as Black on Black crime is the worst its ever been; Blacks looting Black owned stores in the name of social justice beyond absurd! To be sure corporate pharmacy stores vital to the elderly have closed to the injury of their communities altogether. .. CONCLUSION .. NEXT STOP?! 3 What will you do in the day of punishment And in the desolation which will come from afar? To whom will you flee for help? And where will you leave your glory? (Isa. 10:3 NKJ) Note! the day of punishment .. Oh no! Not judgment!..... punishment! Only an omniscient God knows EXACTLY how to make it hurt and hopefully repent the whole purpose for allowing mankind to sin against Him. It was true 2500 years ago and it is true today! .. In the time of Isaiah the 10 northern tribes were removed from the land and replaced by the Assyrian army with other peoples. Frankly I think this is what the DNC is trying to do to American citizens with open borders. But as usual even as Democrat leadership believes the American people to be ignorant of their goals because what they SAY is precisely the opposite of what they do so also WHAT Democrat leadership doesnt know KNOW IS THAT their goals are precisely the opposite of the reality they seek. The educating of the American people and their defeat! Just as Hitler was his own worst enemy so is our current president! ROFL .. To be sure America will have a separation in populations not states (dumb and actually seditious). I have been saying for 2 years that since DNC leadership cant stop lying to the face of the American people THEY will be defeated. THEY will be removed! They their bureaucracies that support them and the anarchists throughout the land will be prosecuted and indeed. Separated just as did happen to the 10 norther tribes. .. BTW I keep hearing about secession. The nonsense of secession of states IS ALSO SEDITION against the Constitution and as well as our VERY SECURITY from enemies domestic and ESPECIALLY FOREIGN. Dont buy into the secession talk. Its nothing more than an attempt to break the conservative movement. I cant believe Dr. Steve Turley wouldnt more meaningfully criticize it!",political,Facebook

"Critical Theory Critical Race Theory Education and Law Enforcement in the United States (publication pending)  Critical race theory although new in the popular vernacular began in the 1970s when some lawyers activist and legal scholars across the country realized that the heady advances of the civil rights era of the 1960s had stalled and in many respects were being rolled back (Delgado et al. 2021).  According to Delgado the critical race theory (CRT) movement is a collection of activists and scholars engaged in studying and transforming the relationship between race racism and power (Delgado et al. 2021). Delgado stated the significant propositions of CRT: (1) Racism is ordinary not aberrational; (2) white-over-color ascendancy serves important purposes both psychic and material for the dominant group; (3) the ""social construction"" thesis holds that race and races are products of social thought and relations and correspond to no biological or genetic reality; and (4) the dominant society racializes different minority groups at different times in response to shifting needs such as the labor market (Delgado et al. 2021).  Critical Race Theory  an analysis  In Delgado and Stefancic's seminal book on Critical Race Theory first published in 1999 with the most current 3rd edition published in 2017 the authors make no mention of the origins of Critical Race Theory. However it is material to a complete understanding of the concept. Critical Race Theory is but one of the many subfields of Critical Theory. These theories view society and politics with a Marxist worldview.  Critical Theory and Marx  Critical Theory (C.T.) is a Marxist approach to social philosophy that reflects and critiques society and its culture to uncover and challenge power structures. The modern C.T. theories have exchanged Marx's view of class conflict for race conflict. Other significant contributors to Critical Theory were Emile Durkheim and Max Weber.  In the postmodern era critical theorists deconstructed the breaking apart of cultural identities challenging the modernist era while viewing social problems as political problems with political solutions. While proponents praise this radical approach to reconstructing United States society critics of Critical Race Theory argue it lacks supporting evidence and has a worldview that reality is a social construct and relies on storytelling instead of scientific evidence.  Critical race theory became a hot topic of discussion in the public square since the mid-2020s and continues to the present. The two largest sub-domains to receive the public's attention are education (K-12) and law enforcement (Defund the Police).  The problem for the person-on-the-street is translating this academic debate into a public debate results in confusion and half-truths. Rufo opines ""Critical race theory is fast becoming America's new institutional orthodoxy yet most Americans have never heard of it  and those who have many don't understand it. (Rufo 2021)  Critical Theory  the foundation of Critical Race Theory  To tell the true nature of a tree one cannot examine just the tree branches but must study the root structure. Likewise to understand Critical race theory one must review the philosophy of Critical Theory.  Critical Theory is a Marxist approach to reflecting on the nature and purpose of how and why individuals in a society behave and how their individual and group behaviors impact other individuals and groups. Individual and group behaviors rarely occur in a vacuum but collectively they use social institutions to express the individuals and groups' decisions. These decisions are described in a political legal and moral context. What makes these Marxist theories troubling is advocates have removed them from the scholarly domain and put them in the public square with an activist approach to social change. The primary purpose of these theories is to reveal and challenge and change power structures between and among individuals and groups. Some favor a mob approach to change instead of rational political change.  In sociology and political philosophy ""Critical Theory is defined as the Western-Marxists philosophy of the Frankfurt School developed in Germany in the 1930s which drew on the ideas of Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud (Buchanan 2018).  The Marxist Approach  Marxists would decry the need to study the individual psyche and behaviors and family relationships because they believe that what creates human experience are the economic systems that structure human societies (Tyson 2014). For Marxists gaining and holding on to economic power is the motive behind all social and political activities including education philosophy religion government law enforcement the arts the media etc. (Tyson 2014).  While Critical Race Theory puts on the robes of theory and scholarship its advocates supporters and radical activists whose goals are aligned with Marxist views use pseudo-scholarship and conjecture to support their ideas.  For Marx and his followers ""economics is the base on which the superstructure of social/political/ideologies realties is built"" (Tyson 2014). The vehicle for gaining economic power is capturing social and political power  at all costs. In Marx's (Marx. Engles and Tucker 1978) critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right (1843) in advocating for revolution he stated  The weapon of criticism cannot of course replace criticism of the weapon; material force must be overthrown by material force but the theory also becomes a material force as soon as it has gripped the masses. The theory is capable of gripping the masses as soon as it demonstrates ad hominem and it demonstrates ad hominem as soon as it becomes radical. To be radical is to grasp the root of the matter.  Class vs. Race  Marxist analyze the behavior of humans their interactions and social interactions focused based on socio-economic classes. Marx theorized that differences in the socio-economic class divide people more than religion race gender and ethnicity (Tyson 2014). Critical theorists and by extension those who follow the ideas of Critical Race Theory embrace the philosophy and beliefs of Marx. But while Marx focused on the 'haves' (bourgeois) and 'have nots (proletariat)' the neo-Marxist have focused on the perceived struggle between the races. While acknowledging Native Americans Hispanics the LGBTQ community feminists and other persons of color the focus as evidenced by the prominence of Black Lives Matter is on conflicts between Black and Whites. The advocates and their followers (especially those who have no understanding of the rationale behind Critical Race Theory seek to create an environment of 'race conscious' instead of uniting society for the benefit of ALL. Posing as scholars they interject their arguments with words and phrases designed to divide and inflame  not to connect people. They use whiteness white guilt the 1619 project (Magness 2020) all steeped with false analogies and fallacious reasoning to stir discontent.  Instead of teaching history and letting mature students reflect on its consequences for the present CRT advocates reimagine the past as the reason for all evil. The lens through which everything is evaluated is the Marxist view of Critical Theory. Subfields of Critical Theory include environmental family gender health medical political knowledge law etc. Two prominent subfields populating the conversation of many individuals business leaders politicians and the media are Education and Law Enforcement.  Capitalism  Marx thought capitalism was part of the stage of economies that would eventually end. In many countries he and his followers advocated and fought for a revolutionary overthrow of capitalist counties that would lead to socialism as a prelude to communism. Even though critics of Marx's philosophies point to the failure of the Communism Bloc in Europe and other parts of the world neo-Marxists point out that none of these countries completely follows the principles outlined by Marx (Tyson 2014). Instead of accepting these failed ideologies Neo-Marxist uses Critical Theory to understand these failures to achieve their ultimate goals and promote an anti-capitalist agenda.  The Family  For Marx and by extension those who believe and follow his tenants the family is not the source of the individual's reason for existence. The family and its members are merely products of material and historical circumstances (Tyson 2014). Marx saw the family unit as a means to promote the values and maintenance of capitalism (Marx et al. 1978a) and therefore it was anathema to his goal of eliminating capitalism. To encourage an anti-capitalist agenda within the United States advocates of CRT think set about to teach this philosophy in schools (K-12).  Critical Race Theory  a branch of CRT  The prominent branch of Critical Theory for the general populace of United States Citizens in 2021 is Critical Race Theory (CRT). CRT advocates push an activist agenda and view human activity based on race instead of class. These advocates use the lens of race to see the past present and future. Some advocates (Delagado Stefancia 2021) question foundational liberal concepts such as rationality legal equality and Constitutionality neutrality. In their view they believe the world is Black or White - literally. Many of these advocates criticize much of the civil rights law and anti-discrimination laws i.e. Brown v. Board of Education. Some foster more radical views of Critical Race theory for non-white cultural separatism and reparations (Delgado Stefancic 1993). Ideas developed in CRT are based on personal experience and storytelling as opposed to empirical evidence. For Delgado and others ""It's about righting wrongs not just the quest for knowledge"" (Delgado Stefancic 2021).  Education  the entry point - indoctrination  An essential question to students' parents and is the purpose of education and the role of schools in 21st century America. The answers have changed over time and continue to change. One example of the past is a statement by Elwood Cubberley Dean of the Graduate School of Education (1917-1933) ""Our schools are in a sense factories in which the raw products (children) are to be shaped and fashioned into products to meet the various demands of life (The Historical Purpose of American Public Education n.d.)."" Current views are revealed n in a 2018 report in which stakeholders gave their ideas about the purpose of education (K-12): (Silliman & Schleifer 2018). The reported findings were:  Although preparing students academically is the most often cited goal of public education Americans also believe that schools should prepare students to be good citizens and prepared for work. While about half 45 percentof Americans believe that the main goal of public education should be to prepare students academically 26 percent believe that the primary goal should be to prepare students to be good citizens and 25 percent say it is to prepare them for work; Preparing students academically may encompass a range of goals including ensuring their success in college or providing the academic skills they need for the workforce.   Significantly no replies indicated that the purpose of American schools was to indoctrinate children with any specific philosophy or belief system. Indeed nowhere within the scholarly literature or their reports or surveys indicating that indoctrinating children in grades K-12 is a legitimate educational goal. Yet there are numerous accounts within the media and other sources that schools indoctrinate K-12 students either directly or indirectly emphasizing Critical Race Theory and other racial constructs.  In reaction to school systems forcing a particular belief system on impressionable children many states passed laws restricting the ideas espoused in Marxist Critical Race Theory. It is worrisome to many that while the philosophy of CRT may not be explicitly stated the reaction of some school administrators is to circumvent the laws through concealment or outright disobedience to both the letter and spirit of the law. Administrators do this through teacher training and masking the curriculum as History lessons. A review of literature on Critical Race Theory shows that the goal of CRT is not teaching history but promoting the concept of racial division.  Marx in speaking about philosophers in his Theses on Feuerbach said ""The philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways; the point however is to change it (Marx 1975. P.620). This change was to be done through 'anti-capitalist classrooms and lecture halls where teacher-designed curriculum to change society including the constitution and operation of schools. (Rikowski 2004)  Law enforcement and Education  Critical Theory and Critical Race Theory both rooted in Marxism reflect their activist roots and radical change goals through organizations such as 'Black Lives Matter and movements such as 'Defund the Police.' These activities impact the Educational System when administrators and teachers modify standard academic lessons to teach radical theory.  Through the daily actions and behaviors of tens of thousands of law enforcement officers associated with thousands of local state and federal agencies the laws of local state and federal governments are enforced. For most people the focus is on the local police agency and their officers since they are likely to view or interact with them regularly.  Constitutional Basis  Police Powers are granted to the various states by the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution - ""The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution nor prohibited by it to the States are reserved to the States respectively or to the people.""  Legislative bodies within the various states enact laws designed to govern behavior and enforce order to improve the safety and security of its citizens. With these laws police are granted the power to compel compliance with these laws as long as their actions do not infringe upon rights protected by the United States or State Constitution. Some critical protections deal with due process and other protections granted by the ""Bill of Rights.""  Over time the phrase ""serving the police"" became attached to the mission of police organizations. In 1963 the Los Angeles Police Department adopted the motto ""To Protect and Serve"" (The Origin of the LAPD Motto - Los Angeles Police Department n.d.) which has been adopted in some form by many other police departments throughout the United States. This duality and mixing of protecting and serving creates conflict among citizens police officers legislators and executives. The fruits of this conflict stem from the actions of various organizations ranging from Black Lives Matter to Defund the Police.  Confidence in Law Enforcement  For the first time in Gallup's surveying public attitudes toward the police its survey found that most American adults do not trust law enforcement (Brenan 2021). The survey showed that confidence in the police had fallen five-point to 48 percent from 2019 to 2020 (Ortiz 2020). The problem is that police officers and administrators are caught in a political firestorm of debate surrounding their role as peacekeepers of community behavior. The discussion is highlighted when looking at the political divisions within the survey results. ""The survey found that Republicans' confidence in the police had risen seven points to 82 percent while Democrats' faith in law enforcement dropped six points to 28 percent"" (Ortiz 2020).  While the survey did not ask any questions about group membership or work status the survey found that 56 percent of white adults said they had confidence in the police while only19 percent of black adults had confidence in the police. According to the Gallup survey this 37-point gap is more significant than any previous survey results.  ""One of the starkest metrics in this year's poll is that 11 percent of Black Americans express confidence in the criminal justice system Mr. Younis editor in Chief of the New York Times said. ""That means nine out of 10 Black Americans in this country do not have confidence in a process built on the theory that all citizens are equal before the law.  This compares with the extremely low number of 24-percent of white Americans which shows an overall lack of confidence in the criminal justice system.  While there is no evidence of a causal relationship between the 'low confidence in the police' as reported by the respondents to the survey and the 'actions of organizations such as Black Lives Matters or incidents of fatal shootings of blacks by the police Dr. Goff co-founder and chief executive of Center for Policing Equity and a professor of African-American studies and psychology at Yale said (Ortiz 2020):  Dr. Goff said that the racial gap in trust in the police could be attributed to the ""kind of law enforcement people from different racial groups tend to receive in this country"" and that ""none of these things are mysteries. It is exactly for the reasons that you think it is.""  But what Dr. Goff found most noteworthy is that now a majority does not have confidence in law enforcement. That's ""unprecedented in this country"" he said and it creates a problem for public safety because compliance with the law ""begins with trust in it and not fear of it.""  It remains to be seen if this year is ""merely a low point for this institution or if confidence in police will continue to suffer beyond 2020"" Mr. Younis said.  Conclusion  Education and law enforcement and under attack by the activist-advocates of Critical Race Theory. The great majority of police officers see their job as protecting and defending the Constitution of the United States and the specific Constitution of the state in which they serve. Most teachers have goals of developing students to be successful in whatever careers their students want to pursue.  Our future as a free country is at risk  and how we educate our children is critical to the outcome. Education is at a crossroads and the future will be decided by the choices citizens make by electing leaders who choose the path of preparing students ready for a career or college. The other path leads to division and discontent with students parents teachers and all citizens and business leaders who desire students who are prepared to be happy and productive community members.  The outcome lies in what political philosophy the United States and the various state Representatives and Senators will follow. Will they choose through legislation the Marxist ideas and goals of Critical Theory Critical Race Theories in which the proponents of these theories advocate radical change or will they choose the path of ""One nation under God indivisible with Liberty and Justice for all.

"THE LONG ARC OF RACISM  The insurrection by anti-government white nationalists on January 6th was 12 years in the making beginning with Obama's election in 2008.  Americans spent the beginning of the 2000s focusing their hatred on Muslims launching two ill-fated wars in an attempt to reassert its global dominance. As America's military might floundered in the Middle East its economy imploded after decades of stagnant wages conspicuous consumption and deregulation came home to roost. Then the unthinkable happened.  A Black man was elected president.  Racists rallied to the call.  Obama was surely not a legitimate president. He wasn't even a legitimate American!  Tea parties gathered decorum was cast aside (e.g. ""You lie!"" yelled at the State of the Union) and fragile white Americans were soon able to excuse their every failure and soothe every insecurity as the consequence of Obama's election.  The Republican party rallied the support of ""angry white men"" to help ""keep them in business"" and Donald Trump rode that wave of amorphous bigoted ignorant rage to the White House.  White nationalists had their president and he considered them ""very fine people."" The arc of American decay that Republicans often infer began with the Voting Rights Act and hastened thereafter had reached its nadir with Obama's election and Trump was finally making America great again (wink wink).  But his God-given presidency was about to be cut short by of all things Black voters in cities like Atlanta and Philadelphia who dared exercise the very rights that brought the cultural decline of America nearly 60 years ago.  Despite weeks of calling for violence Trump's white nationalist supporters were welcomed to Washington DC in a manner that stood in undeniably stark contrast to that which Black Lives Matter protesters received 6 months earlier. Where BLM were met by the National Guard in tactical gear on the steps of the Lincoln Monument Trump's racist insurrectionists were allowed to run wild all the way into the Capitol and onto the floor of the Senate.  Americans soothed themselves saying ""this isn't who were are!""  Yes it is.  It is who we have always been.  Angry.  Fragile.  Entitled.  Violent.  and  Racist.  Trump's defeat doesn't fix these problems or heal these wounds.  Black voters saved America from Trump.  Now it's time for white people to step up and save America from...white people.",political,Facebook

"A prepared statement by the candidate:  Good Morning my Fellow Minnesotans  Today I would like to speak on small businesses Unions and political campaigns of today's day and age.  Unions are a vital part of this country and the community. Talk to every proud union member they will tell you what the union does for them. Unions ensure that companies treat their employees fairly that the employees are fairly compensated they provide resources to employees and their families when needed and they ensure that employees laid off must be re-employed by the company. Unions stimulate economy by ensuring fair wages and this also helps keep employees from relying on government programs. Unions have gotten a bad reputation we have all heard at least one story where someone was protected by their union when they should have been fired or that they breed laziness. All I can say is that without the Union 9/11 would have worse on my family. My Mom was a union member this may make me a bit bias because I grew up knowing her union friends. On September 24th 2001 without warning My Mom went to work at NWA and was told she was no longer employed with the company; she was being laid off. This didn't just happened to her 2500 employees of Northwest Airlines' Minnesota operation were given the same news. The office's department boss on September 11th 2001 told everyone present that nobody was going to be laid off. Speaking for the company her department boss stated that the company was confident that 9/11 while tragic was not going to hurt any of the office employees. On the 24th it was exposed to be the lie that it was. My Mom's tenacity landed her in front of the late Senator Ted Kennedy who was the chairman of the HELP committee. My Brother was diagnosed with cancer at the age of 4 years old and was a patient at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis Tennessee. With my Brother and I's pre-existing health conditions as well as Mom's insurance financially impossible. Thankfully we lived with my Grandparents and they helped shoulder some of the burden while Mom gave my Brother and I a voice in congress. The Union helped Mom get her job back with insurance that covered all of us. Anybody who has been out of work knows how expensive COBRA is and knows the financial impossibility of being able to afford it. Without my Grandparents and the Union my Brother and I would have been placed in foster care because my Mom through no fault of her own found herself unemployed due to a terrorist attack. Unions may get a bad reputation but in circumstances like 9/11 they are without question very valuable. One final example of how unions are vital to stimulating our economy is NWA's AMFA contract. An employee who stayed a cleaner for 5 years back in 1999 would have received a little over $18 an hour this is in contrast to the national average of $14.02 reported in 2000. These figures come from page 401 of the 2008 edition of the US Commerce's Statistical Abstract of the United States.  Like Unions small businesses are vital to our local economies. Small businesses employ local workers and often times have more understanding and compassion for their employees' unique circumstances. These business get taxed astronomically and in some cases the taxation causes them to shut down in the lean years. My Grandparents owned a business from 1974 until 1992. The business was started as a blacksmith in 1892 by my 2x great grandfather Michael J. Corcoran who later moved the business into downtown Rosemount in 1916. The business would pass hands twice until it reached my grandparents Dick and Pody Corcoran. Employing 10-15 residents of the community they were one of many businesses that were responsible for employing roughly 90% of Rosemount's residents. A string of bad city council decisions from roughly 1980 into the 90's saw many of Rosemount's small business quietly close their doors seemingly overnight. The decisions made by the City Council hurt the small ""Mom and Pop"" businesses and practically ensured their inability to thrive. My Grandparent's weathered these decisions despite having the cards stacked against them from the start. Many of the businesses were offered to move by other cities who saw the value they would provide their communities. Some of these businesses could afford to move while others would have the money to move only after selling both their inventory and the building they owned. My Grandparents along with a couple other family businesses decided to stay despite the offers they had received. Each business that stayed had a myriad of reasons for doing so. My Grandparents in part stayed because they felt they were a valued business; a feeling that the city council took every opportunity not to reciprocate despite the feelings of Rosemount's citizens. In '92 as a final act of hostility the city council denied my Grandparents the right to gift to the Catholic Church the land they owned where the original store had stood. The city council deemed the land to be too valuable and would not allow any gifting to occur. From 1916 until 1986 the old store stood as a shiny white beacon to the travelers heading north on Dodd through Rosemount. In 1986 the building was deemed to be too much trouble and it was agreed that it should be demolished. The city council didn't help that matter by constantly dragging my Grandparent's in to talk about a spring that was purported to lay under the old building. To our knowledge they never found such a spring. From the beginning my Grandparents weathered the storms that came with inheriting a financially failing business. Grandpa and Grandma took this financially failing business and turned it into one that generated close to a million dollars each year. Grandpa prior to taking over his family business taught the Dale Carnegie's business courses. After he took over the business Grandpa joined the 500 million dollar club in lawn and garden besides being named the top salesman in the tristate area in the same category. My Grandparents were proud to serve the citizens of Rosemount. The downside to owning a small business was not lost on Dick and Pody and they knew all too well the struggles of keeping a business going; this of course came with its owns costs. I am friend to small businesses because I do believe they are valuable to a city's local economy and help ease the unemployment rate at the local level. While big businesses have their place the quality of services and product often cannot compare to that from a small business; most small businesses take pride in the service and product quality that they provide. Due to the fact that small businesses are not as wealthy as the big box stores they instead have to rely on their reputation for quality workmanship and/or services. Small businesses get taxed as if they are wealthy but wealthy businesses don't get taxed the amount that they should. Companies like Walmart and Amazon contribute to the number of employees on government programs. While they may fix the employment problem they contribute to the continued need for welfare. Small businesses provide their employees a quality of life and a sense of purpose that big businesses are unable to offer with their heartless policies and cutthroat sales tactics. Often these employers drive out small businesses because they can pay more in taxes than a small business can. City Governments often care more about the profit they can make over the quality of life of their citizens. Small businesses have been studied in other countries and it was found that the quality of life was marked higher than those who worked in big businesses. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics small businesses are able to provide a wider range of benefits than big businesses with paid holidays vacation sick time retirement benefits and insurance being among the most offered benefits for small businesses. We must protect the working class with Unions and by allowing small businesses to grow and flourish. So now let's talk about the ways politicians get you to vote for them and why my campaign is different.  We have heard them every election year politicians running their smear campaigns against their opponents. While annoying to many of us by the time November rolls around these ads are actually quite effective. These ads do help people lean towards one candidate or another. These politicians are trained on what they have to promise in order to be elected. Every time you watch one of those ads you can be assured that someone was behind it all pulling the strings. Campaigns launch less than honest means to get votes don't believe me search for campaign management on Youtube sometime. They use children family or fears in their ads to get you to vote and the scary part these tactics psychologically get you to vote for or against a candidate. To win public office yes you must compete with others however unlike most races the ethical rules for candidates largely involve finances and the dissemination of dishonest or outright false material. I am on record with stating that I believe these campaign methods while effective not only are dishonorable but cheapen the office for which the politician is running for. I will answer any attack made upon me by a fellow candidate and I will do it with honesty and integrity. To do anything less is not only shameful conduct but and this is my belief should disqualify a politician from ever holding a public office. There was a time in this country where we believed in ethically campaigning for office. What a person did in their bedroom or in their private lives was off limits because it had nothing to do with the office they were running for. Somewhere along the way our country started to favor a more gladiatorial spectacle than that of honesty and integrity. Politicians being the gladiators and the public being the emperor; remember thumbs up the gladiator lived down they died. You have heard it said that an honest person cannot be elected to office but how we wish we could go back to that. Every year we hear politicians make campaign promises that they never deliver on. They know that if they make enough promises that sound great you will likely elect them. When they fail they don't take responsibility rather they shove it off onto somebody else. If I make a promise that I cannot keep because of mitigating factors I will ensure that I take responsibility for the promise and that I explain why I was not able to deliver on it. The values of honesty and integrity do still matter and we must hold politicians accountable who use less than honest means to charm you into voting for them. So how is my campaign different. First I am not made of money and so the likelihood of seeing a political campaign commercial paid for by me is very slim. I would rather people donate their time or contribute by telling others about my campaign. If I feel that a campaign account needs to be set up I will alert donors to this fact. I will run an honest and ethical campaign I am not going to lower myself to the level of those who oppose me the office of the Governor must be above that. If I am to be elected it will be on the content of my character my honesty and my will to do good for this state. I want to be a governor in the people's heart not psychologically maneuver them to vote for me.  This may lead to the question of how then am I qualified to lead this state? if you want experience in public office you'll find none. The experience that I have is in dealing with the public and listening to the experiences of those who are older than myself. I have worked with the public for 15+ years and been paid for only 6 of those years. I have volunteered for the American Legion at their brat and hot dog stand raising funds for ""Veterans on the lake."" This organization takes both able bodied and disabled veterans as well as active duty military their family and friends and allows them to have a fishing vacation away from the problems of civilization. I volunteered 10+ years with the American Legion and I am proud to call those tenacious veterans my friends. Most are veterans of Vietnam and Korea servicemen and women that were largely unappreciated when they came home from fighting overseas. The biggest thing that I believe makes me qualified for public office is my willingness to make things better for the State. How many times have you applied for a job and have been told to reapply when you have more experience? I call these the ""Thank you but no thank you"" letters. How can one gain experience if nobody is willing to let them get their foot in the door. No I didn't plan on making a career of politics but in light of all the recent events I feel it is time a citizen not a politician takes the oath of office and begins to work with our citizens to accomplish a better Minnesota. The shootings the riots the attack on the US Capitol and everything else that has happened has reminded me of this question posed in the movie Lincoln: ""Do you think we choose to be born? Or are we fitted to the times we are born into?."" Out of all the candidates that are running for the same office as I am all of them have held public office and therefore may be seen as more qualified than I am. However if we continue to complain but do nothing to change it we will continue to elect the same politicians we claim to despise. I feel that I have been fitted to the times into which I was born. I don't have to be the most qualified person in America I just have to be the most qualified out of those running for office. Honestly I have to be more qualified than the same tired politicians that we have elected time and time again. Only you can make that decision though. If you truly want the government that Lincoln spoke of in his Gettysburg address that Government of the people by the people and for the people then I ask that you stray away from the traditional candidates and take your chance on me. I can't let you down because if I do I not only let you down but I let my family friends and future generations down. How could I face my children as a failure. I will hold myself accountable to the people who have elected me and not to the party that nominated me. In the end the nomination doesn't matter it is the voters that take their chance on me the ones that place their trust and faith in me; those are who matter and those are the people that I must work for!  Good Morning to all of you on this beautiful Friday I thank all of you for doing your job today because I know many of you have very thankless jobs. You are appreciated by me and always will be. You make this State the best in the Union and make our Country a better place to live. Keep up the great work!",political,Facebook
Have you ever disagreed with an FDA approval? Only to find out later you were correct!  When I hear people say its FDA approved Im not sure if I should laugh or cry.  The FDA is responsible for more loss of American lives through their incompetence and negligence than most realize.  America is facing is biggest Opioid crisis in American history. The FDA approved Suboxone as a medication! This medication is the size or smaller than a bandaid. It has become a very poplar street drug and another drug problem.  Speaking of drug problems Adderall typically prescribed for ADHD is now a huge problem on the black market. Similar to the opioid epidemic. Doctors are fearful to prescribe Adderall due to the overcompensation of years of street abuse of this medication. In fact a board certified psychiatrist cannot prescribe Adderall without the patient getting an extensive Nuero psych evaluation. Its like the highest level specialty physician cannot help a person suffering from ADAD without approval. This can take many months. The patients who are genuinely in need of pain meds or ADHD medication have to jump through every hoop imaginable! Next time you need a pain med! Good luck! Youll never see a physician pass the buck like they do with pain meds!  Alcohol is sold at gas stations now and is the most violent producing drug of all drugs! Alcohol is dangerously addictive (withdrawal can be potentially lethal by Grand Mal seizure).  When good healthy Americans had to shut their businesses down because of Covid liquor stores remained open. This is because hospitals wouldve been bombarded by potentially lethal alcohol withdrawals when trying to prepare for Covid. I found that responsible of the government.  Unfortunately physicians are under a microscope with writing opioid pain medication now and often dont prescribe to people really suffering in pain due too the 'overcompensation' after years of overprescribing.  Childhood obesity (and adult) is massive in America. The FDA has recommended several different diets over the last 40 years. Americas obesity problem continues. But is this the FDAs fault?  The FDA approved benzodiazepines. One of only two drugs on the planet that can be potentially lethal during withdrawal via Grand Mal seizure.  Benzos are the most prescribed mild tranquilizer in America for anxiety. Millions of Americans live as hostages to benzos because theyre extremely addictive. Many physicians believe benzodiazepines are the most addictive drug (legal or illegal).  The FDA approved estrogen to help older women. It caused a lot of cancer for woman so the FDA corrected that.  My concern now the FDA recently approved testosterone injections (TRT) for men with low testosterone. Testosterone is an incredibly powerful synthetic steroid. Men even in their 30s can get a doctors prescription. Heart disease is already the number one cause of death in men. Testosterone while its an amazing hormone essential for much of a mans health. However it does nothing good for the heart. Hopefully it isnt as bad for the heart when prescribed in low doses by a physician.  Margarine bugs wont even eat it. Anyone know if margarine is healthy? Nutella?  Im just curious these are the things Ive seen does anyone have any examples of things they saw the FDA approve or recommend then change their mind later?,political,Facebook

Two Growing Systems of Government Revenue  One from taxpayer earnings and one from no earnings at all.  Another way of saying the same thing is that there is 'Wizard of Oz' money and real world money.  A phenomenon has been growing since the sub prime crisis of 2008 to increasingly bail out Wall Street and the big banks by 'printing money' out of thin air that is then used to buy assets i.e. real estate stock buy backs and mortgage backed securities.  The Federal Reserve now owns more than 30% of the mortgage backed security market in the entire United States. This means massive government control of private assets into public hands.  And there is no end in sight as the Fed is purchasing $120 billion dollars of Treasury bills per month to boost the economy. While the Fed and Treasury are doing what they believe is the right thing the consequences of government spending that is not backed by current taxpayer money is beginning to show cracks in our economy through rising inflation. Trillions of dollars printed into the country's money supply does have unintended results contrary to most MMT (Modern Monetary Theory) theories.  One consequence is the devaluation of the dollar meaning that the purchasing power of families is diminishing through higher prices and this trend may not be as temporary as the Federal Reserve believes.  The whole system of printing money for ever increasing costs of new government programs is coming to a head. We are like a family who is going bankrupt that then decides to max out a new credit card to pay for the debt that has already been incurred thus putting off the day of reckoning that will surely hit even harder than it would have if nipped in the bud earlier.  Ponzi schemes are defined as a fraudulent investing scam which generates returns for earlier investors with money taken from later investors. The government is caught in a similar scheme. It is printing trillions of dollars to pay for current debt spending with newly created debt.  Thus more taxes are needed to be raised from hard working taxpayers to pay just the interest on the national debt (now nearly $400 billion dollars per year) and this is with an interest rate of 1.5 percent. The government can't afford to have interest rates rise because a relatively modest interest rate comparatively speaking of just 6% would break the sovereignty of our whole system. We only take in $3.5 trillion dollars in taxpayer revenue per year. A 6% interest rate would equal approximately $1.8 trillion dollars half of our total revenues.  In order to prevent a crash the government will simply print trillions and trillions more in order to support the system from collapsing with ever increasing rates of inflation as a result making the cost of living so high as to be unmanageable.  Taxpayers must start demanding greater responsibility and forthrightness from our government and the Federal Reserve. We the government speaks of government spending it is a bit of a misnomer. It is taxpayer spending. We the people are footing the bill and are being put ever more in an impossible debt situation. There is no free lunch period.  What to do? Educate yourself on the goings on and be as self sufficient as possible.  'No taxation without representation' was the original protest movement against monarchical rule in this country. We now find ourselves in a similar situation. The oligarchic rule of big money has in a real sense become the new 'monarchy' and the people's interests are not being represented in the halls of Congress. We have taxation but no real representation.  The promise of America is still alive but we must begin to get our house in order. Sound principles and sound money have to return in order to give us a solid foundation again. From there we can once again grow and prosper.,political,Facebook
Another mass shooting in San Jose CA. More lives senselessly ended.  The TV pundits are blaming the politicians who have failed to enact gun safety legislation that would vastly reduce the gun violence epidemic in America.  To be sure blame does indeed rest with them. But even more than this blood is on the hands of every American citizen who has elected and then again and again re-elected those politicians who have failed to take the appropriate and proven actions that would vastly reduce such violence.  If you voted for Ted Cruz you are an accomplice to these murders.  If you voted to Lindsey Graham you are an accomplice to these murders.

Make a mistake once and it has the potential to be a learning experience. Make the same mistake again and it indicates a learning disability.  Will you resolve to do everything within your power to make sure that those politicians who have failed to take action never again get re-elected?  Will you resolve to do everything in your power to use your voice on social media and within your local state and national communities to make it clear you will not tolerate a failure of our elected officials to act and that you will never again vote for those who have failed their duty to protect us?

Spending Update:  Speaker Pelosi released the text of the initial 1684-page multi-trillion dollar social--and socialist--spending extravaganza that she wants to ram through the U.S. House of Representatives and impose on the country as soon as possible.  While we are still reviewing the full details it is clear this will increase taxes on working families and small businesses while driving up prices even more.  It will grow the size of the IRS while ignoring the crisis at our Southern Border.  Speaker Pelosi is right about one thing--this legislation will be transformative. If this behemoth passes it will fundamentally change America as we know it and put our country on a dangerous path toward socialism.

WHAT ON EARTH IS GOING ON? Even the secular unbelieving world is stunned at all that is happening in our collapsing world. Most have no explanation for it. Some offer weak explanations that to the tuned-in and spiritually astute are laughable. Even once-sound pulpits remain silent and perplexed. Political commentators suggest that if we just elect their candidate all will be rosy again someday soon. Their faith is in their political party. We Will Own Nothing and be Happy? Leftists promise that if we fix climate change and spread the wealth around we will achieve peace on earth. Outfits like the World Economic Forum suggest some day if we follow their formula we will own nothing and be happy! How can society be happy under Godless Communism?Here are my conclusions as to why were where we are in history. I am sure the list is much longer than this but here goes: Our times are perilous because God is trying to wake up and warn a sinful world. People dont listen when life is smooth-sailing. The Bible is fulfilling itself. It predicts perilous times (II Timothy 3); a Laodicea end-time church; a Romans 1 society at the end characterized by depravity. Evil and violence will escalate. The birth pangs will become intense and will be hard to watch and read about. We get worn out seeing floods fires droughts and hurricanes. But the Bible says these things must happen. God is warning because He always warns before He judges and the world is facing judgment. It is being judged now but far worse is coming during the Tribulation. This is just a warm-up. There are terrible consequences when we dont do things Gods way. Society will fail. The church will head into apostasy. But prideful mankind always thinks their way is best and wreckage results. God is specifically sending a message to His church. He is trying to shake us up so that we will wake up and ultimately look up. America and the world are now caught up in end-time strong delusion. That has serious consequences. Delusion does not permit people to think rationally and to act reasonably. It does not allow people to vote sensibly. The consequences are staggering. Many think that politics will be the savior or a particular political party. They just want to make America great again but minus Gods oversight. God is letting us know that only one nation under God will ever function properly and no nation can be great and Godless. America showed God the door fifty years ago. That has consequences. His blessing and protection may have left when we opened that door! God is allowing some pre-Tribulation birth pains on the entire world. But what we see happening today is minor compared to what is coming. The Church will be absent during that Tribulation time so in the meantime may we have a greater burden to save people from the wrath to come. The consequences for a world that rejects Jesus Christ are unthinkable. America and other Western powers have to fade as world influencers so that global government can rise up and rule the world. As these nations diminish keep in mind that this is orchestrated by God for his end-time purposes. Lastly I think there is chaos on earth because Satan knows his time is short and he has ramped up his activity. He is getting new recruits for his kingdom. This is all the more reason we must be salt and light in these final days. What Did You Expect the End-Times to Look Like?,political,Facebook
We the people us them you people connotations that are invoked to describe certain groups or various individuals. We hear or use this descriptive adjective to gather specific responses from certain groups or individuals. It gives rise to separating certain classes of persons from those who place themselves as more significant than the whole. In their endeavor to create a new nation separate from their European oppressor's factions of people decided a revolution was needed to break from the tyranny of their British oppressors. They developed new laws and rules that would allow free people to govern and live free from dictatorial regimes. Yet in their quest for liberty and freedom they neglected to remedy the injustices that they would deliver upon people that they perceived as none human beneath their definition of civilized. They would continue a systematic concept to alienate those who looked different from themselves. They would develop a version of history that would deny those unlike themselves a place in how our country evolved. Our most significant fault is the lack of truth in how this nation came to bedenying the acknowledgment that without all our participation this nation would not be. We have come too far into the future to whitewash still so many untruths and injustices that have occurred in the name of flag and country. We are negligent in our duties to create a perfect union why because the most significant lie that is still upon us is racism and hate what needs of laws and rules if every person is not afforded the same rights and principles as those who perceive themselves above their definition of law and order. Where is the justice if by being born different from those who feel they are entitled and privileged to be treated above reproach because of the color of their skin? Our society has come to a fork in the road. We have suffered a great pandemic that has place significant burdens upon the most vulnerable of our nation those being persons not wealthy enough to afford losses of any kind. Yet there are those with the ability to weather the storm but they deny aid and comfort to less fortunate people. By what concept or ideology can those of wealth speak for those less fortunate. What can you who have told those who don't hold on be patient? Where is the logic in a representative of means telling their constituents that lack what they don't need? We are being pimped and pandered by individuals lacking moral senses and devoid of ethical and sound reasoning. Their goal is greed and self-gain. They soothe and appease those with status and wealth to keep their place in society. What good are the words WE THE PEOPLE if their plan is for self-gain? Where is our representation in government if they think only of their selfish intents? We have looked into the eyes of pure evil. They bombarded us with false rhetoric and divided us with hatred and division. We allowed ourselves to give rise to those who embellish power and look only to themselves as great unequal rulers. Their word is the final and only word they perceive to know what is best for all people. Now is the time for persons of good character to stand up and be accountable. It is time for us who believe in Democracy to cry out and demand changes in all our systems that would deny fair and equal opportunities because of race religion preference of identity and social and economic standing. Let us become that which God created us to be unified and loved. If we stand united nothing can divide or dissolve this UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

Never in history has there ever been so much desire by some citizens to destroy a freedom based constitutional republic. A republic with fredoom of speech religion & numerous other fredoms. The freedom to criticize the President the government officials at all levels & the government in general.The freedom to spit on the flag & to burn it & the freedom to not respect the national anthem in public. Such behavior or will to destroy the country does not exist in the worst totalitarian regimes in the world. Not in China not in Cuba not in Russia  not in Iran & not in Venezuela or North Korea.They do not exist in any other country in the world. Not in most of the Middle East Africa South America other parts of asia and even some of Europe. It is obvious now that excess liberty is poisonous and leads to chaos and erosion of the very liberties that allow that behavior in the first place. Many before us have warned us of this.

China is building new ports new infrastructure and new cities in China and abroad and America is eliminating borders and legal immigration. America is arguing for males to compete in female athletics and gender neutral bathrooms. The whole world is dependent on China for almost all products including medicines that are vital.

I was reading about our Pilgrim Fathers who founded America. When they landed at Plymouth Rock full of vision. The first year they established a town the next year they elected a town council. In their third year the town council proposed building a road five miles out into the wilderness for westward expansion. But the townspeople criticized it as a waste of public funds. Amazing! Once they had been able to see across oceans to new worlds now they couldnt see five miles down the road. What happened? They failed to keep their vision alive. How can you keep that from happening to you? (1) Keep your vision before you at all times. Write the vision and make it plain that he may run who reads it (Hab 2:2). Your vision is the road map for your life. So write it down read it regularly and keep it before you at all times. (2) Make sure the vision is yours not somebody elses. In the name of being sensible or practical many of us ignore our God-given desires. We undertake a career to please our parents or our spouses or others. That may make you dutiful but it wont make you successful. You cannot fulfill a vision that is not your own! (3) Believe in yourself even when others dont. You may be succeeding if nobody else believes in you but you will never succeed if you dont believe in yourself. No matter how old you are always stay young at heart.

Wow what a disgrace ! Kamala Harris went all the way to Mexico & Guatemala ! She went to discover the root causes of the border crisis & the reason people leave those countries to come to the U.S. Hasn't anyone told her that people from all over the world have been coming & are coming here legally & illegally all the time. They came from England France Italy Ireland Scandinavia Germany The soviet Union and China and every other country on the planet ! They continue coming ! Kamala YOUR parents came here from Jamaica & India ! They certainly did not come because they wanted to face systemic racism or discrimination. Why have you not learned why they came here ? Ask millions of others who want to come here. Let me give you the reason for the ROOT cause of the immigration here. It is called FREEDOM & The American Dream. They come because they seek that American dream & the freedoms & opportunities it offers. You are too politically blind to admit this truth ! Let me see if I can see other root reasons people come here ! Is it because a Barack Hussein Obama can become President from a non American father for two terms. Maybe it's because a Kamala Harris can become Vice President from foreign born immigrant parents. Wow Kamala we found the reason why people come here and we did not have to go around the world to figure it out.What a shame you had to waste so much time & taxpayer money to go figure this out abroad when the answer was right here at home.

Class is in session. Stand. Pledge. Sit.  Attention Trump Save America Pac donors/would be donors: Trump has not spent even a dime on ANY ballot reviews Donald Trump has been promoting.  FACT Out of the $75 Million in donations the former President has ranked in in 2021 alone donations have thus far gone to Trumps travel Trumps legal fees and Trump's staff. Much of the donations are being held in cash. Currently the Arizona recount via Cyber Ninjas is being paid for via private donations which are not being disclosed.  So when you see a post from Trump or Trumps Save America Pac that say We need you to join the fight to SECURE OUR ELECTIONS! you are just donating to one of the former Presidents most lucrative funds. NONE of this money is actually going to ANY elections previous or moving forward.  Lets look at some other elections facts because the big lie is kinda getting old now and any 12 year old that can do research for a book report could find this information if they chose to.  FACT Republicans OUTPERFORMED Democrats up and down ballot in the 2020 election.  Republicans gained 13 seats in Congress with zero losses by GOP incumbents. Every House Republican in a tossup race won. A record 35 Republican women won election to Congress. Republicans won 59 of 98 state legislative chambersa net gain of two state houses and 141 seats across the country.  FACT There are even Republicans that won in their own election in 2020 that say the election was rigged. For example in Arizona Paul Gosar and Andy Biggs both objected to the certification of the election for Joe Biden based on fraud DESPITE the fact that they won in their own elections. So if the election was rigged against Donald Trump how would Republicans then win their own seats? Paul Gosar and Andy Biggs are not the only ones. Republicans Lauren Boebert Marjorie Taylor Greene and Andrew Clyde all won in Georgia. I could go on. In other words how could Democrats able to rig the election for Joe Biden to win yet they seemingly were unable to rig down ballot elections? Shouldnt these Republicans ask for a recount of their own wins if voting in these states are in question?  And what about Dominion voting machines?  FACT Dominion software was not used in ONLY states that Trump lost and/or states that Trump has filed lawsuits in. The fact of the matter is that this software was used in TWENTY-FOUR STATES.  FACT Dominion software was used in. ONLY SIX STATES that went BLUE for Biden. These include Nevada Arizona Wisconsin Michigan Pennsylvania and Georgia. The remaining EIGHTEEN was won by Donald Trump.  FACT Donald Trump filed lawsuits in the above six states but DID NOT in the ladder eighteen.  So WHY would Dominion software be hacked in some way in just six states when these machines could have all been hacked to vote for Biden? Why JUST these six? And WHY isnt Trump filing lawsuits in ALL 24 STATES? In theory wouldnt you want to file lawsuits in every state that used Dominion as to find out what it was about just these six states machines?  And for that matter how do we know that if fraud occurred some of the dominion software in states that went red could have in the same way have been hacked to go red when they REALLY went blue?  Just totally stupid right?  So lets discuss whats really going on here with this election and just MOVE ON because this debate got stale months ago. Donald Trump lost this election for TWO main reasons.  1. Trump lost voters. These voters either switched to Biden or they did not vote for President and voted for Republicans down ballot. Here is the specific breakdown of 2020 voters per Pew:  *Biden made gains with suburban voters. In 2020 Biden improved upon Clintons vote share with suburban voters: 45% supported Clinton in 2016 vs. 54% for Biden in 2020. This shift was also seen among White voters: Trump narrowly won White suburban voters by 4 points in 2020 (51%-47%); he carried this group by 16 points in 2016 (54%-38%). At the same time Trump grew his vote share among rural voters. In 2016 Trump won 59% of rural voters a number that rose to 65% in 2020.  *Trump made gains among Hispanic voters. Even as Biden held on to a majority of Hispanic voters in 2020 Trump made gains among this group overall. There was a wide educational divide among Hispanic voters: Trump did substantially better with those without a college degree than college-educated Hispanic voters (41% vs. 30%).  *Apart from the small shift among Hispanic voters Joe Bidens electoral coalition looked much like Hillary Clintons with Black Hispanic and Asian voters and those of other races casting about four-in-ten of his votes. Black voters remained overwhelmingly loyal to the Democratic Party voting 92%-8% for Biden. Biden made gains with men while Trump improved among women narrowing the gender gap. The gender gap in the 2020 election was narrower than it had been in 2016 both because of gains that Biden made among men and because of gains Trump made among women. In 2020 men were almost evenly divided between Trump and Biden unlike in 2016 when Trump won men by 11 points. Trump won a slightly larger share of womens votes in 2020 than in 2016 (44% vs. 39%) while Bidens share among women was nearly identical to Clintons (55% vs. 54%).  *Biden improved over Clinton among White non-college voters. White voters without a college degree were critical to Trumps victory in 2016 when he won the group by 64% to 28%. In 2018 Democrats were able to gain some ground with these voters earning 36% of the White non-college vote to Republicans 61%. In 2020 Biden roughly maintained Democrats 2018 share among the group improving upon Clintons 2016 performance by receiving the votes of 33%. But Trumps share of the vote among this group  who represented 42% of the total electorate this year  was nearly identical to his vote share in 2016 (65%). Biden grew his support with some religious groups while Trump held his ground. Both Trump and Biden held onto or gained with large groups within their respective religious coalitions. Trumps strong support among White evangelical Protestants ticked up (77% in 2016 84% in 2020) while Biden got more support among atheists and agnostics than did Clinton in 2016.  *After decades of constituting the majority of voters Baby Boomers and members of the Silent Generation made up less than half of the electorate in 2020 (44%) falling below the 52% they constituted in both 2016 and 2018. Gen Z and Millennial voters favored Biden over Trump by margins of about 20 points while Gen Xers and Boomers were more evenly split in their preferences. Gen Z voters those ages 23 and younger constituted 8% of the electorate while Millennials and Gen Xers made up 47% of 2020 voters.  *A record number of voters reported casting ballots by mail in 2020  including many voters who said it was their first time doing so. Nearly half of 2020 voters (46%) said they had voted by mail or absentee and among that group about four-in-ten said it was their first time casting a ballot this way. Hispanic and White voters were more likely than Black voters to have cast absentee or mail ballots while Black voters were more likely than White or Hispanic voters to have voted early in person. Urban and suburban voters were also more likely than rural voters to have voted absentee or by mail ballot.  2. Republicans opted to not vote because they were told that the election was rigged and that their vote would not count. Donald Trump told his Republican voters for months and months prior to the election that the election would be rigged if he did not win. This is because he had internal polling that showed he was losing the election due to his handling of COVID19. As such Republicans simply did NOT make use of early voting they instead voted on election day. Conversely Democrats overwhelmingly opted to vote by mail.  And here is one last piece of data that might clear up any remaining doubt. Donald Trump did not win in 2016 by the millions and millions of voters that he says he did folks.  FACT Trumps victory was so small in fact that he actually won in 2016 because of 77000 votes in three states Michigan Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Almost three million MORE voters voted for Hillary Clinton. To put this into perspective you could fit all of the people that Trump won the election with into ONE SINGLE SMALL FOOTBALL STADIUM.  Trump isnt spending his money on election fraud claims because he knows there was no election fraud folks.  Extra Credit  Trump has been known to trick people into donating more then they had intended. Although its difficult to pinpoint an exact number of how many people were duped there is a figure that suggests lots of people ended up donating more money than they intended. Trumps campaign refunded 10.7 percent of the money raised on the Republican Partys fundraising platform WinRed. That amounted to around $122 million in online donations in 2020 ALONE.  Trump's own disclaimer notes that Trump may shift campaign-donor money into his private buisnesses.  Thats all.,political,Facebook

Recently a friend of mine was defending Liz Cheney and criticizing Trump and those that support Trump which is certainly his right to do.  For me Lizs diagnosis is simply: Liz is suffering from TDS and cannot focus on winning back the house. Personally I support president Trump because he points out weakness which is the primary problem with Republican leaders is the most pro-life president in my lifetime is not using politics for financial gain as many do and although rude and obnoxious at times always puts America and the little guy first. Additionally no other national leader has ever had the courage to demand school choice for every child in America which is critical for those like me who are only concerned for those that will follow us.  For me it is always policy over personality and honesty over slick political rhetoric. I respect who you support whether Liz or anyone else but for the future of mine and everyones children I hope the disruptor in chief trump decides to run again and God willing wins again.,political,Facebook
Can the Era of America and of Personal Responsibility Make a Comeback? 'The People's Interests vs the Special Interests.'  Over the past several decades there has been a creeping decay of our values especially of personal responsibility and this has placed our society in jeopardy.  There is now an era of personal irresponsibility at both ends of the spectrum; the Mega Banks and big Wall Street corporations are taking billions of taxpayer dollars virtually given to them by the Federal Reserve to buy back their own stocks and real assets at the people's expense and on the other hand stimulus packages forbearance and prolonged unemployment benefits are given to individuals who could be working but who milk the system.  Both ends are being irresponsible. The taxpayers who are working will foot the bill however. The people at the lower end are being placated to buy their votes and those corporations at the top end are being placated so they can continue to fund the political class and remain in power.  We have unfortunately gone from an America of personal responsibility in a few short decades to an America that is becoming more and more unrecognizable and irresponsible.  We need a rebirth and renewal of America and a re-definition of democracy that instills core values within a modern society.  A big problem is that the special interests of big money are concentrated while the people's interests are diffused.  This must be reversed. The people's interests must be concentrated and the special interests must be diffused.  It can be done.  The Party of the United States Help us gain ballot access in North Carolina.

Oh God the degree of incompetence of Joe Biden is mind boggling. He really thinks that there was no way to get out of Kabul without the chaos and the disaster he created. The Vice President has disappeared and general Milley head of the army seems angry at Americans expecting a better exit strategy !!! It seems that incompetence ineptness unprofessionalism & pure stupidity trickles down from Biden to his VP to the Secretary of State the Pentagon the Intelligence Services and Homeland security and the NSA & some of the army chiefs. That is what you get when you select people strictly based on everything including race & gender & ethnicity but not based on merit & experience and intelligence and capabilitiy.

An old friend once told me that those who stand still are falling behind. We have been successful as a community. I am proud to be a citizen of Tiffin. I see a bright future. But only if we dont let up dont circle the wagons and only protect what we have. I believe that there is much yet to accomplish in all areas of our community life. I want to see Tiffin as one shared neighborhood with affordable housing good paying jobs a common back yard called our parks and a start in life that knows no equal in America for all our children.

"#friendsofSMART  More information pertinent to SCTA RCPA SCTLC and The Climate Center.  Jack National Grid/Hitachi ABB power grids study highlights major opportunities for electrification of fleet vehicles Sept. 16 2021 Study identifies need for substantial stakeholder planning analysis and preparation. A new study from National Grid and Hitachi ABB Power Grids reveals proactive planning and coordination will be needed to enable the electrification of large fleet vehicles and meet their charging needs.  States and businesses are looking to electrify delivery maintenance and public transportation fleets in the coming years to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and local pollution. The study evaluates potential charging needs from large-scale fleet electrification and calls for coordinated planning among utilities fleet operators and state and local governments to meet those needs.  ""The electrification of fleets of vehicles such as delivery vans and buses offers a big bang for our buck in the fight to reduce emissions and decarbonize our transportation sector"" said Brian Gemmell chief clean energy development officer at National Grid. ""This study demonstrates why it's important that we work together with our communities state local and business stakeholders to prepare for the electrification of medium- and heavy-duty vehicles and why we need to start now to ensure the clean fleet transition progresses at the pace needed to meet decarbonization goals.""  As businesses and local governments move to decarbonize the transition toward electrification of commercial vehicle fleets is seen as an element of net-zero strategies. National Grid and Hitachi ABB Power Grids' study ""The Road to Transportation Decarbonization: Understanding Grid Impacts of Electric Fleets"" was undertaken to understand the charging needs of electric medium- and heavy-duty vehicles (MHDVs) such as buses package delivery vans freight trucks and others and how electric fleets might impact the electricity grid.  ""The shift toward electric vehicles is one of the most critical steps in the broader evolution toward a carbon-neutral energy system"" said Anthony Allard executive vice president and head of North America for Hitachi ABB Power Grids. ""Strong collaborations with key partners in the energy ecosystem such as this study with National Grid will help ensure that we are prepared to accelerate this transition and meet our sustainability goals while maintaining the flexibility and resiliency of the grid.""  Electrification of fleet vehicles is a significant opportunity to quickly reduce carbon emissions and provide other environmental benefits. In states like New York and Massachusetts fleet vehicles like trucks and buses make up three to four percent of vehicles but around a quarter of on-road emissions. In addition electrification provides access to clean public transportation including in disadvantaged and environmental justice communities and reduces local air pollution (such as particulates) and noise pollution.  National Grid and Hitachi ABB Power Grids focused the study on a major northeast metro region in the United States seeking to understand how differences in fleet locations use patterns fleet sizes and other factors impact fleet operators' charging needs. The study also explored how resulting electric demand could affect specific portions of the electric distribution and transmission system. The study identified more than 50 fleets operating in the metro area analyzed their potential charging behavior and power needs and mapped them to actual electric distribution lines and substations.  The study reveals that portions of the electric grid could eventually be overloaded by these large vehicles' charging needs if system upgrades or alternative solutions are not progressed in tandem with electric MHDV adoption. This is particularly true where vehicle fleets are ""clustered"" in certain areas (for instance one distribution feeder might eventually support at least 10 electrified fleets and more than 400 electric MHDVs).  Importantly the study recommends that critical stakeholders  utilities system operators fleet operators and policymakers  act now to begin forecasting and planning for the medium- and long-term impacts of fleet electrification and to develop least-cost least-regrets solutions. The study suggests that solutions consider an ""end-to-end"" approach: transmission distribution and distributed resources in addition to managed charging programs.",political,Facebook

"The African Americans born in this country before 1955 are the most ignored people in this country. We have kept silent we have watched as what was the cause of the Civil Rights Movement have become symbolic: just something to talk about. A whole lot of us have died and are dying every day. Soon there will be no way to tell who are descendants of the enslaved people stolen from their homeland. After the civil war a group of black ministers met with General Sherman and was asked what did they want for their people and themselves. They said ""we want land"". They were given land and even the loan of a mule. Then that land was snatched away from them and replaced with conditions far worst than slavery. In the Bible slavery for Jews was not written in the law: there were only three ways that one could become a slave. Poverty Theft and Parental Authority. It could not last for more than 7 years . and slaves could not serve with ""rigor"". The Egyptians changed those laws and rules. As time went on Slaves in American enforced their laws with ""rigor. After 400 years God did something about the condition of his people. It is said that punishes and Forgives. It has been 400 years and more that slaves were brought to America. When the Jews were finally let go they asked their former owners for silver and gold. The Bible does not mention who received these things but I conclude that the silver and gold were given to the elders. Since then countries have agreed to pay reparations for mistreating people that they have wronged. This country has done that for Japanese and the Native Americans. The Black race have received written apologies but there has been no monetary compensation. I believe that there is cause for them to compensate the oldest members of African Americans. These suffered after being set free. That is why 65PlusAction was founded and with the help of God we will prevail.",political,Facebook
I am sitting here thinking about both the last year and the future. Like everyone in the world Americans born in the 1950s or later have gone through the hardest event of our lifetime. COVID 19 has affected us like no other event. In addition to COVID itself we have seen our country go through a divisive 12 months from protests during summer 2020 to the events in Washington DC a few weeks ago. As I reflect on where we are today I cannot think of another time where the country is more divided.  In the past Americans have relied on our elected officials to lead us through troubled times but what we see today is primarily division between the left and right. Each side blames the other for everything and acts like they are the only ones with the answers. Then there is the Media  there was a time we turned on the News to see what was happening in the US and around the World. But today aside from a few shows all we get is partisan talk instead of the News which only continue to expand division. Finally there is Social Media that when first launched was a great platform for connecting with family and friends. It is now more of a place to spread division and incorrect or partial facts coming from all sides.  I believe that most Americans would agree with each other much more than they would disagree if they only took the time to talk about issues. It is only those who believe in positions on the far left or right that usually do not see the ability to find common beliefs. Why is it that we all tend to find a way to common ground in our personal lives but seem to have lost the ability to do this when discussing issues?  Would most of us not agree that Violence in any form from any group should not be tolerated? Would we not all agree all Americans deserve the same rights as the other? Should we not make sure that our trade policies are done fairly and not allow America to be at a disadvantage? Should we not be a country that has protected boarders and do our best to only allow people to enter our country legally? For those people who are not properly in our country but obey the law  should they not be treated in a humane manner? Shouldnt we help Americans in need through no fault of their own?  America has never done well when we were divided but look at what American has done when we were united. I believe we all need to dedicate ourselves to turn the page on the years of division and start moving to return to more unity. This will not happen if we just say we will when the other side makes the first move.  God Bless America.,political,Facebook

It was after traveling abroad for a summer we entered New York Harbor by ship. I I saw the Statue of Liberty and I was overwhelmed by emotion. I was 9 years old and at 9 years old I knew and felt what the statue represented.  Foremost it stood for freedom. Freedom of free speech having a difference of opinion from others I love talking about our differences Sometimes I learn new things sometimes the people I am in conversation with learn from me.

Understand that leftists are religious fanatics and label all of those who oppose the leftist faith as racists white supremacists misogynists etc. They will then do all that they can to destroy the lives and families of those who do not follow the faith.  Here are some prime examples of untrue things that the left holds as self-evident truths.  A biological male becomes female when he says hes female Biological men have no advantage over women in sports The number of genders cannot be counted Nearly everything in life can be free The government can provide for all of societys needs All whites are racist no other race is racist Blacks who disagree with the faith are white supremacists Math is racist The English Language is racist. Spelling and grammar are racist Forcing children of color to learn the above is racist Everyone is an oppressor or oppressed. There are no people just trying to live life. You can raise the taxes on the rich and they wont leave Raising taxes on businesses will create jobs Building a business is greed Taking other peoples stuff isnt greed Abortion is a matter of my body my choice Vaccines arent a matter of my body my choice Voter IDs are racist Covid passports arent racist Small children should learn about the intricacies of sex including things like anal sex 18-year-olds shouldnt own guns 16-year-olds should be able to vote 14-year-olds should be able to get abortions without parental knowledge 3-year-olds should decide what gender they are If you take guns from law-abiding citizens criminals will stop shooting people Not arresting people for committing crimes will lower crime rates The protests that caused many deaths and billions in destruction were peaceful November 6 in DC was an attempted insurrection by violent extremists (though none had weapons) The biggest problem in the US military is white supremacy Organized Christianity is evil Orthodox Judaism is evil Islam is good and peaceful Israel is an oppressor. The Palestinian Authority and Hamas are forces for good America is the only nation on Earth who had slavery Pay no attention to modern nations who commit horrible human rights abuses.

"The crime rate is rapidly rising.Blue run states are defunding their police and the rest of the police forces are resigning in droves.They have been vilified & discouraged to the point where they would rather not be part of the police & part of law & order. Those who commit crimes are let free even when captured to repeat criminal activities all over again.The real criminals are given a free pass while the democrats are creating the fear of a non existent ""white supremacist'""fear. It has all bee planned from almost 4 plus years ago & is leading to the destruction of this country. All this is done with the goal of the socialist fascist democrats to keep power. It is not about America common sense nor law & order nor justice. It is all about power. There is no civilized society without a police force. They are now trying to weaponize and politicize the armed forces. It was embarrassing to watch & listen to Mark A. Milley Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff the other day. He is the highest ranking military officer. Biden has held office for almost 50 years and his party has controlled government as long or longer. Why has this been allowed to exist if it is as bad as they say it is. Obama was President for 8 years and Biden his VP for those 8 years. Why all of a sudden this cancel culture Critical race theory racism and the appearance of so much white supremacy. Did the democrats just realize this ? No this is all made up to change the country once & for all for something that has been tried and failed every time in history & wherever it was tried. Innocent people are being harassed and intimidated while the criminals and the guilty are being let free. Guns are not killers but instruments to kill in the wrong criminal hands.Cars are for transportation but can also be used to kill just like steak knives and box cutters. If this country wanted to select or elect anyone to destroy it including the strongest most powerful countries in the world they would not have done as good a job as this mad man and his VP. God help America and give its people the courage & unity to stop the destruction of the republic. Little more of this insanity & there will be nothing worth saving !",political,Facebook

"President Stephen Ray on the Insurrection Staged at the United States Capitol yesterday:  ""A bedrock value that has animated Chicago Theological Seminary since our founding has been an unwavering commitment to a vision of America as a just society. Our vision of a just society is one in which freedom equality and hope are constitutive elements.  We have understood also from the beginning that ours is but one vision of what America ought to be. There is a vision against which we have stood that desires a nation of blood and soil in which those not of white European descent should never be allowed the full fruits of citizenship nor the right of governance within our society. This is what was at stake in 1855 as the nation stood on the brink of dissolution because of the iniquity of slavery.  What is at stake for us today is whether this will be a nation in which democracy is meant for us all or just for the few; whether the inalienable rights intoned in the Declaration of Independence will be recognized for us all or just one race; whether the hope for a nation in which freedom rings from every mountaintop and justice rolls down like a mighty stream is but a fools dream.  Before us today is the choice of whether we will commit ourselves to the building of a better nation worthy of the devotion of all of its citizens or will we be prisoners of our often-shameful white supremacist past? Let us be clear there is no middle ground. As was obvious yesterday white supremacy will give no quarter to maintain its hold on the structures of our government nor will it flinch in destroying those structures when they lead to a pluralistic and inclusive future.  So today we at Chicago Theological Seminary rededicate ourselves to the building of a new public square in which there is no place for the malice and hatred that took flesh in halls of nations Capitol. We rededicate ourselves to the work of building a society in which peace is not purchased at the expense of the rights and freedoms of our neighbors. In this work we invite all people of goodwill across the spectrum of faith to join us and we pledge to stand with any so dedicated to building a brighter tomorrow for our children.  With malice toward none with charity for all with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right let us strive on to finish the work we are in to bind up the nation's wounds to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan ~ to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.

"""The Psychology of Trump-Haters""  Whats happening in America right now shouldnt come as a surprise to anyone. It could be spotted from miles away!  As a psychologist watching the political back and forth in the USA over the past 5 years is pretty incredible. Seeing people say what theyve said behaved in the way theyve behaved and made the decisions theyve made has been interesting to watch. Its also illuminated a very clear truth.  The reason why Trump-haters hate Trump so much is not because they actually hate Trump the person. Because they dont even know him. Theyre definitely not protesting Trumps competence or political policies. Because well lets face it he did an incredible job with our economy protected the people inside the country with strong borders and won the respect of so many around the world. Allies felt supported. Enemies knew not to mess. Prospects knew to tread carefully. And he did it all so confidently unabashedly unapologetically. How attractive!  So the question remains if its not his personality and its not his policies what is it? Notice that people who have been critical of Trump tend to be very reactionary in their position. Its a highly emotional topic for them. It stirs up a lot. Interestingly the reaction has been so powerful and pervasive that it even has its own syndrome!  And therein lies the answer to this question. The people who have been so vehemently opposed to Trump are not really against Trump. Theyre upset at what Trump triggers deep inside them. That is what they're reacting to when they hear ""Trump."" Trump reminds many of the unprocessed anger they have towards authority figures in their lives. Maybe an angry father. Perhaps a controlling mother. Possibly an abusive boss. For many people the idea of Trump has woken (no pun intended) up tremendous emotional pain and psychological trauma that these people have not dealt with. And that they have not wanted to deal with.  Psychologically-speaking thats how we got here. Thats why so many picked Biden. I put it in quotes because they didnt really pick Biden. They just wanted to escape Trump. Or I should say the painful memories that Trump stirred up inside them. Was Trump opinionated? Of course he was. Was he outlandish in his delivery at times? Absolutely. Did he come across as arrogant and egotistical at points? Without question. Its all true!!!  But objectively that is what you want in a President of the USA. That is what you want from your Commander in Chief. That is what you want from the guy whos sole responsibility and duty is to go up to bat for you. You want someone who will unabashedly stand up for you guard you and protect your interests with everything hes got when it comes down to the wire.  The truth is to guard and protect properly sometimes you have to be bold. You have be direct. You have to be aggressive. Otherwise some wont hear you. They will not respect you. They will manipulate you. And they will walk all over you.  To the Trump haters I feel for you. Living this way must be complete emotional hell. Because youre always on the run. Your life is driven by fear. You make decisions that are based in anxiety and avoidance. Youre constantly looking to make choices not that you necessarily personally believe in but because they are less triggering. And unfortunately sometimes it leads to this. The truth about Biden is clear to everyone now. At least it should be. He was never fit to be a leader in this capacity. The writing was on the wall from the very beginning. Some decided to see it. Others were too scared to. Because it stirred up too much. Its okay. You didnt know.  Hopefully this incident can be used as an opportunity for you to exercise the courage to look inside and see what your triggers in life actually are. Consider. Who talked down to you growing up? Who hurt you? Who made you feel so little ? Pay attention to it. Process it. Address it.  You will see better. Decide better. And live better.",political,Facebook

VOAs termination of Bangla Radio broadcast is nothing but a vanity Muhammad Ali Bukhari from Toronto   In a press release on July 13 2021 Voice of America (VOA) declares its ending of the Bangla Radio broadcasts after serving for 63 years in worlds 7th largest language spoken by the people of Bangladesh as well as Indian states of West Bengal Tripura and Assam while assuring to expand its television and social media content considerably due to VOA Banglas 16 million weekly audience now interact into them heavily. In support it corroborated statements from Acting VOA Programming Director John Lippman and Acting VOA Bangla Service Chief Satarupa Barua.  However are those perspectives and statements justifiable and or true in reality? Given technological advancements around the world particularly the internet based facilitations such as apps and Smartphones Radio still plays a vital role as it is more than just announcers news and songs. It is about companionship and the emotional connection with the listener. Radio broadcasts real-time information and it reaches across borders and can become a valuable source of information where reliable news is scarce. Radio has proved its worth in times of emergency such as when access to mobile networks is down as a result of an overload or phone lines are cut. Even if there is no electricity most radio sets can be battery operated or have the ability to be hand cranked. Thus Radio is not just important for reception of emergency announcements and communications during disasters. More importantly radio is easy to use it is live and it is human. Over a century radio has survived and prospered by being the easiest of media to use. Wake up in the morning have a shower get in the car turn on the radio - these are the reality of the fast-paced world and developing countries like India and Bangladesh as well.  For such in todays social media world where websites and applications enable users to create and share content or to participate in social networking is a way to connect people who have similar interests and backgrounds depending on race ethnicity age and alignment to political parties. It is interesting then that the three most popular digital platforms in this spectrum such as Facebook Twitter and Instagram are full of controversies and confusions.  According to a research survey of U.S. adults conducted June 16-22 2020 by the Pew Research Center said From global protests against racial injustice to the 2020 election some Americans who use social media are taking to these platforms to mobilize others and show their support for causes or issues. But experiences and attitudes related to political activities on social media vary by race and ethnicity age and party. People can be politically active on social media in many ways. This survey asked Americans about four different types of activities that they may have engaged in on these platforms. Overall about one-third of social media users (36%) say they have used sites like Facebook Twitter and others in the past month to post a picture to show their support for a cause look up information about rallies or protests happening in their area (35%) or encourage others to take action on issues they regard as important (32%). A smaller share (18%) reports using a hashtag related to a political or social issue on social media during this time.  Considering these prognosis in mind I recently put forward 5 (five) specific questions in a reply email to the Acting VOA Programming Director John Lippman but he failed to respond back. That saga happened in connection to sharing my Bangla and English article titled as What justification makes VOA to shut down its Bangla radio broadcast service? published in Canada USA and Bangladesh particularly the English one has been shared with the top VOA executives including him via email as well as shared with the US President Vice President and foremost 4 (four) US Congress Representatives via Twitter as the US Congress entity is responsible for allocating the funding for whole operation of VOA (Voice of America) under the US Global Media.  One may wonder what I have asked John Lippman in response to his enthusiastic email. I feel the justifications of those questions have shaken up his perceptions as he earlier wrote to me Our research reveals that audiences for radio especially medium wave and shortwave are rapidly declining across the region. Conversely audiences for television and web are growing dramatically. VOA has terminated radio transmissions to Bangladesh in order to redirect resources to those platforms where we know audiences exist and are growing. While its accurate that there have been changes to our leadership team in Washington and to our network of correspondents in the region with the termination of radio broadcasts our requirements have changed. Their departures were in complete accordance with terms of their contracts.  While I questioned about the leadership and the genuineness of dramatic change I also asked If audiences for radio both MW and SW are rapidly declining across the region then what is the appropriateness or logic behind introducing another Rohingya language program from the same VOA Bangla Service why then other regional languages are up running? Similarly I have questioned Are those growing number of audiences in television and web basically in the social media genuine or the vital declination that happened in radio due to the lack of presenting the news and information what really does the audience want in Bangla such as those times when they used to eagerly waiting and or simply looking forward to listen to them or in contrast helplessly Dozens of domestic television and radio stations fulfilling the demand rather VOA Bangla is unable to compete as the term used in your press release?  I know now why the Acting VOA Programming Director John Lippman did not respond because he knows VOA Bangla cannot build its 63 years old past glory or reputation simply through increasing presence on social media platforms single-handedly and its claim of Engagement actions on the Twitter account have risen 54% over the previous year while video views on Instagram are up 274% in the same period are not true and genuine. In that verification one can easily visit its website and surf around. Firstly in a cost-cutting measure its interface has been poorly designed less demanding news items are presented and selfishly described History of the Bangla Service with irrelevant information as well as a low-resolution tiny picture. Secondly the said website navigation can take you to see its posts on Facebook Twitter YouTube RSS (Really Simple Syndication or Rich Site Summary) Feed and Podcast. Lets check the time apartness/frequent items and how many people liked or shared them particularly those on the Facebook Twitter and YouTube. Also find the non-available Instagram to judge their claim? Thirdly how did the poor website take VOA Bangla into what level of inferiority in terms of About Us?  Hence Radio has a critical role in modern society in communication or getting the feedback that are used to consume information and its ingredients fueled to our development such as looking for reasoning education entertainment promoting job and businesses which cannot be compensated in a thrift vanity of social media platform alone. As a result in the race for the largest social media outreach radio broadcasters have fallen back on antennae and pointed spires  with the result that dreams are not so much efficient uses of getting proper feedback rather overblown vanity endeavors.

Government leaders are servants not rulers in America.  Every time government uses force and mandates to try to achieve a desired result Americans naturally bristle. Its in our DNA.  Individual freedom is what sets America apartthat no one is free unless the rights of each individual are respected by government. The collective good can never trample individual God-given rights recognized in our constitution because if it does then none of our rights are secure.  Government leaders need to CONVINCE people not mandate actions. Using force and mandates are counterproductive means to increase vaccination rates. The more forceful the mandate the more public resistance it generates.  If government leaders want the appearance of doing something they issue mandatesand even worse they issue those mandates by unconstitutional decrees. On the other hand if they want to be effective they inspire people and convince them with scientific facts that withstand healthy scrutiny and robust questioning.  That is why it is such a fundamental mistake for our President and Governor to still be issuing emergency executive orders instead of allowing Congress and the Illinois General Assembly their essential roles in representing the public as constitutionally co-equal branches of government.  Congress and the Illinois Legislature need to hold public hearings questioning scientists and health experts deliberate in public and allow the people to also be heard. We need to recognize the diversity of our country and our state and that one size never fits all. We need to respect local control. Our battle against all variants of COVID-19 can only be won by inspirational leadership that motivates our people.  My colleague Senator Dave Syverson made a timeless point that when rights are taken away they are almost never given back. As a public servant I will fiercely oppose unconstitutionally forceful mandates that are counterproductive and that also have the effect of diminishing long-term individual freedom.,political,Facebook

"The state of this world is getting scary. It's unfortunate that many do not see it.  Millions are marching around the world in protest every weekend against ""The Sniffles"" lockdowns poke mandates and the removal of civil rights liberties and freedoms. With at least a hundred thousand protesting in cities and towns around Australia. ""If you forget the past you are doomed to repeat it."" ""I don't agree with what you say but I'll give my life defending your right to say it."" Two very important statements the kids of today are not being taught. Free speech is something the whole world needs. Even racist hatred and down right evil things need to be allowed to be said. Gives us the opportunity to hit back through words NOT violence.  Let's start with ""The Sniffles"":  The fear being pushed by politicians and the media about ""The Sniffles"" is out of control. No I am not one of those that think ""The Sniffles"" is a hoax. ""The Sniffles"" is real. As I read once: Do I believe that people are getting sick? Yes. Do I believe that people are dying? Yes. Do I believe some hospitals are overrun? Yes. Do I believe nurses and healthcare workers are terrified? Yes. Do I believe China is lying about it's numbers? Yes. Do I believe ""The Sniffles"" was made in a lab? Yes. Do I believe China is responsible? Yes. Do I believe ""The Sniffles"" is being politicized? Yes. Do I believe ""The Sniffles"" is being used to strip Americans and Australians of their rights? Yes. Do I believe there's a bigger picture than what politicians and the media are telling us? Yes. Do I believe this is more about power and control than anything else? Yes. Do I believe we as Australians just set a dangerous precedent for our freedoms? Yes... and I am much more terrified of that than any virus.  Am I an anti-poke? No I am 100% for pokes. Myself and my family are all poked for everything except for the ""The Sniffles"" poke. No I do not plan to get the ""The Sniffles"" poke. I will not inject a poke into my body that is being forced upon me. Especially a poke that was ready in less than a year. It takes at least 5 years to fully test a poke. We do NOT know the long term side effects yet. I am Anti-MANDATORY poke I am not Anti-poke. Take the poke if you want I support your decision to take it. But don't force it on me.  I do not believe in lockdowns or mask mandates. We lived with Influenza (a virus that had a confirmed 0.13% death rate for the years 2016-2017) for generations without mask mandates or lockdowns. I used 2016-2017 because they are the latest years where the numbers are confirmed. [1] ""The Sniffles"" is far more deadly for over 60's than Influenza particularly those with underlying conditions with a death rate of about 0.66%. However When you account for elderly patients dying to ""The Sniffles"" without an underlying condition that death rate drops to 0.2%. Compared to the 0.08% Death rate for under 60's with ""The Sniffles"" dropping further the younger the bracket. ""The Delta Sniffles"" is less deadly but more contagious. Please note I am talking about the death rate (Your chance to die if you get infected) not number of deaths. These numbers are based from the CDC's own words that 90% of ""The Sniffles"" cases will go completely undetected as most of the population is asymptomatic to the ""The Sniffles"" Virus. All this information can be found on the CDC website.  Now while the death rate is higher than influenza in the older generation. This is no reason to completely shut down a country even at the high end of 0.66%. No one wants to even talk about the rising rate of ""Self harm"" especially in teenagers due to lockdowns. These lockdowns are causing far more damage than they are preventing Not just in ""self harm"" rates. [2]  Next Abortion:  Abortion is getting out of control. The latest data from Planned Parenthood states that over 98%... YES OVER 98% of the reasons given for Abortion is ""Unwanted Baby"". Less than 2% is due to Rape / Incest. 2 reasons that are the only time I ever agree with Abortion and ONLY before a heartbeat. [3] Both men and women need to take some responsibility for your own actions. If you cannot afford / want to bring a baby into the world then Wrap it Swallow it Flush it Throw it or just say no. But please STOP using Abortion as a contraceptive. Stop killing babies because you couldn't keep your pants zipped up. I accept that accidents happen but that's the risk you take when you say yes. Deal with the consequences of your actions.  And now for the US itself:  The US is being run by a senile dementia ridden old fart controlled by special interest groups in the hopes of turning America into a communist dictatorship. The Left leaning Mainstream Media is complicit in this they regularly distort the truth to push their own agenda. Notice they are not reporting on the Phone call between ""Dementia man"" and the Afghan Leader ""AG"". A phone call that if it happened under ""T man"" He would be rightfully impeached before the media could even report on it.  In this phone call ""Dementia man's"" own words pressured ""AG"" to distort the truth: ""Dementia man"" to ""AG man: ""And theres a need whether it is true or not there is a need to project a different picture."" [4]  This is not the first time ""Dementia man"" has pressured another country to help him politically: Then Vice-""Dementia man"" with ""O man's"" backing threatened to withhold aid money if a prosecutor that was investigating the company ""Dementia man's son"" was working at was not fired. From then Vice-""Dementia man's"" own lips: [5]  There are multiple other examples of corruption lies and propaganda by the ""Dementia man"" administration and it's buddies in the media. However this post will become a novel if I continue. Follow me for more examples in future posts.  And finally Australia:  Australia itself is sliding down a dark path. Our country is done as we know it if the population doesn't wake up and soon.  Queensland is opening a concentration camp in the center of the state. [6]  Victoria is the next communist China puppet state. Led by a known Communist supporter. [7]  Multiple other articles showing the corruption of Daniel Andrews. The Federal Government just passed a spy bill. Allowing them to access our phones and upload or delete data at will. [8]  The media around the world doesn't even care that Australia has begun a process to strip its citizens of what little rights we had. I fear that most Australians have forgotten what happened 80 years ago. We don't even have the means to defend ourselves any more they are scared another Eureka Stockade will happen.  It is time for Australians to take a stand. It is time for us to take our country back but we need help. We need the world to care about what is currently taking place in Australia.  Australia must ditch the crown. We must become a Constitutional Federal Republic. We do not have a Bill of Rights that needs to change. We deserve our freedom. But we must earn it first.

Are the good times really over for good? Folks we are the shining light the country needs to get through these hard times. People (most on the right side of the spectrum) belittle companies and people for mask mandates and vaccinations. I personally do not support the masks or vaccinations being pushed by companies or the government. But keep in mind my friends these are all privately owned companies and can do whatever they want with their own company. Just as much as the mom and pop corner store can dictate the terms of service. This is the (in my personal opinion) best thing about capitalism. We can Choose to use that company or products if we do not agree with the company. We have so many options with all of the technology to buy products or services with companies that hold your personal values. If you dont want to buy from Walmart because they may require masks then go to the local grocery store where they dont. If you work where they mandate masks or the shot there are an abundance of jobs that are so very short of workers you can make a healthy wage. Same goes for any situation. If a company supports something you do not value I assure you there are other companies and service providers that share your values. I know Im some cases especially is you are in a major city where every company is for the lack of a better term so far left they have left the country (Ronald Regan) then if you are able get away. But the people politics and whole country are as an old friend of mine said like a pendulum. It will go way to the right. Then it will swing to the middle then to the left. Like before 9/11 then that terrible tragedy happened the country as a general whole went right. We have swung far left now. We need to bring it back. Supporting businesses that support you voting for people that support you and first and foremost treat others as you want to be treated. You or I may not agree with the protester crying for whatever cause they may believe in. But remember they believe in their cause just like you and I believe in our cause. The only way to make your point is to show them your point and how it ends and show them how their means end. On a separate note I will be posting much more in the future so show your friends and family. Have discussions and think about how you treat people. You may not like the person in the front of the store telling you to put your mask on but remember that person is working when most chose not too he more than likely does not want to tell you that and he may not agree with the mask rule but they are people just like us and he is choosing to work rather than collect money and sit home.

"Just a quick ""Heads UP"" on the many new so called Medicare Advantage plans. I too was taken in by the slick ads on TV that push and say these new ""all in one"" Medicare advantage plans are better than the old Medicare plans because they offer all kinds of extras and you allegedly get your money back because you don't pay for Medicare extra plans anymore etc.  Well I talked to my doctor my local hospital and they warned me to not switch from my plan N or plan F which are the best plans Medicare offers (and if you drop these plans Medicare will NOT be offering them anymore) because they cover almost all of your ""hospital costs if you ever need to be put into a hospital for a long term care. Getting back to the ""new"" all in one plans the small print on these plans is exactly where you will pay through the nose. You see if you get hospitalized the advantage plans do not cover as much of the hospital costs so you will end up paying from day one and it only gets worse. Please check this part of the small print for hospital stays and see where these plans get you good. Sure they offer all of the so called extras but they get you on the hospital plan part because they don't have to pay you do. Read the fine print of these so called ""All in one"" plans. Don't ' switch because you will not be able to go back to either plan F or N.",political,Facebook
"How Do You Change A Society? Indoctrinate The Children  Mile High Houndog Nov 2 A major Gubernatorial race happening today in Virginia. A major issue that has arisen in fact the major issue is critical race theory. The republican Glenn Youngkin has pledged to ban it. The democrat Terry McAuliffe says its not being taught. There has since surfaced emails and receipts from the Virginia department of education show they paid 625 an hour to CRT consultants. Here is an excerpt from an artical from Guy Benson on Townhall:  ""McAuliffes idea that its not taught in Virginia schools is verifiably false. We have records including actual contract receipts from Loudoun County Virginia. They actually are paying six hundred and twenty five dollars an hour for consulting. That specifically references critical race theory by name...The former superintendent even admitted in an email to parents that the ideology that theyre promoting in Loudoun county are directly aligned with critical race theory. And also in Fairfax County we have Asian-American parents that are in revolt against changes to the advanced education system and they argue that with the implementation of critical race theory ideology in Fairfax County schools theyre now going after merit. Theyre going after advanced classes...We have actual receipts and contract data. And so McAuliffe is trying to maintain that fiction until he can kind of run out the clock.  So why are they lying about it. Liberals have had control of our public education for a long time now. One thing they have learned starting in the 60s is how to play the long game. The 60s generation are now our college professors their children and grandchildren are our primary school teachers. They realized long ago that if you want to change a society indoctrinate the children. What is happening now is a direct result of that why do you think that young voters vote primarily Democrat? They are trying to change the thinking of the country through our children. Terry McAuliffe actually said parents should not be allowed a voice in their childrens education. All this started when we took God out of the schools and started teaching evolution as fact not theory. Most people now even many Christians take it on its face that evolution is correct. We need to protect our children get them out of public school. There should be a boycott of all public education until they start doing what the people want. Stop Indoctrinating Our Children! Parents are perfectly capable of teaching their children about social issues. America ranks 38th in the world in math and 24th in science. Whereas China ranks number 1 in all 3 major categories. While we are crying over social issues China is taking over the world. We need officials that will go back to the basics and teach our children what it takes to make it in the world and not teach divisive racial studies. We are 1 country under God indivisible where all people are created equal. #protectthekids",political,Facebook
No! the Taliban will not take over Kabul & all of Afghanistan in 90 days. They will take it over in a matter of weeks or days at the most. The Afghan government & military will be annihilated in days. The innocent Afghanis who worked with the Americans will be raped tortured & slaughtered ! The stupidity & ignorance of the American government the carelessness 20 years of blood and tears trillions of dollars of taxpayer money & American credibility & honor down the drain in a matter of weeks. Now Biden is  asking  the Taliban to please not attack the US embassy in Kabul. This incompetent imposter & his entire administration are an embarrassment & a disgrace for America? I truly feel disturbed by the incompetence of this man & his direction of the US military & strategy & his weak generals. The Taliban met with the Chinese already Who will smartly get them To become allies.. The Chinese will buy & own Afghanistan like the rest of the world they have overtaken while were discussing & obsessing about transgender bathrooms & other complete nonsensical matters. Biden has been a failure all his life for both domestic & foreign affairs. His foreign policy & his miscalculation of international situations has always been a disaster. Now the problem is that unfortunately he is in charge. God help the poor Afghanis who are part of the government and the army & who were on the side of the Americans. They are already fleeing but I don t think they stand a chance. God help the woman of Afghanistan & God help America ! There is not one positive outcome since Biden has taken over. A disaster at the border inflation robbing Americans of their income crime rising to record levels & police resigning. Employers not finding workers due to stimulus that makes working not worth it & a complete mess with the mishandling of the Covid epidemic with conflicting daily misinformation & lack of direction. Everything is much more expensive including the most essential items such as food & gas prices. There is record spending & back breaking expenditures with no income to pay for the waste. Trillions of dollars of wasteful  stimuluswhich is really creating uncontrollable inflation & debt. There has never been so much division & uncertainty !

A man tortured and hounded by the Nazis risks being imprisoned again because he cannot sit idly by watching freedom sink under the dark cloud of Nazi repression. America could have sat idly by in 1941 safe behind a natural wall of 2 giant oceans watching Europe be gobbled up by Hitler and watching Asia be subjugated by Tojo. Many Americans at the time argued for isolationism. But FDR rallied the American people to be the defenders of freedom and American families sacrificed over 400000 of their sons and daughters in that titanic struggle. Hundreds of millions of people live in free societies today because of their sacrifice. My own mother survived to walk out of a Nazi concentration camp because of her American liberators.

"DIVORCE AGREEMENT  THIS IS INCREDIBLY WELL-PUT AND I CAN HARDLY BELIEVE IT'S WRITTEN BY A STUDENT!!! WHATEVER HE RUNS FOR I'LL VOTE FOR HIM.  Dear American liberals leftists social progressives socialists Marxists and Obama supporters et al:  We have stuck together since the late 1950s for the sake of the kids but the whole of this latest election process has made me realize that I want a divorce.

We can smile and chalk it up to irreconcilable differences and go our own way.  Here is our separation agreement:  Our two groups can equitably divide up the country by land mass each taking a similar portion. That will be the difficult part but I am sure our two sides can come to a friendly agreement. After that it should be relatively easy! Our respective representatives can effortlessly divide other assets since both sides have such distinct and disparate tastes.

You are however responsible for finding a bio-diesel vehicle big enough to move all five of them.  --We'll keep capitalism greedy corporations pharmaceutical companies Wal-Mart and Wall Street.  --You can have your beloved lifelong welfare dwellers food stamps homeless homeboys hippies druggies and illegal aliens.  --We'll keep the hot Alaskan hockey moms greedy CEOs and rednecks.  --We'll keep Bill OReilly and Bibles and give you NBC and Hollywood.  --You can make nice with Iran and Palestine and we'll retain the right to invade and hammer places that threaten us.  --You can have the peaceniks and war protesters.  --When our allies or our way of life are under assault we'll help provide them security.  --We'll keep our Judeo-Christian values.  --You are welcome to Islam Scientology Humanism political correctness and Shirley McLaine. You can also have the UN. but we will no longer be paying the bill.  --We'll keep the SUVs pickup trucks and oversized luxury cars. You can take every Volt and Leaf you can find.  --You can give everyone health care if you can find any practicing doctors.  --We'll keep ""The Battle Hymn of the Republic"" and ""The National Anthem.""  --I'm sure you'll be happy to substitute ""Imagine"" ""I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing"" ""Kum Baya"" or ""We Are the World.""  --We'll practice trickle-down economics and you can continue to give trickle-up poverty your best shot.  --Since it often so offends you we'll keep our history our name and our flag.

"Just under two weeks left until the election. Its been an interesting experience to say the least. Ive been accused of being a hardcore republican and Ive been accused of betraying republicans. False rumors have been spread that I sued my neighbors over arborvitae. Others have said I cut deals with current board members to get appointed later this is also false.  What I have done in an attempt to make our district better is get between two political machines mainly out for each other. Ive made unexpected new friends and connections with people of many different backgrounds. Its truly amazing how much you have in common with people when you reach out and just talk with them.  My incumbent opponent says she ""successfully navigated a safe return to schools using data informed approaches and public health guidance."" In my opinion nothing could be farther from reality. Health organizations were calling for kids to be in schools but she not only voted to keep them closed but voted to create metrics making it harder for schools to open leaving many students at increased risk for abuse neglect depression anxiety drug use and even suicide.  My other opponents team sent political fliers to registered democrats pointing out that Im a registered republican. I did expand on their campaign slogan of Five Full Days because people want to know what else the challengers are offering beyond just getting back to school. The Beyond Five Full Days is a direct response to an online post by the chair of the NCSD school board asking what do you have other than opening the schools.  Interestingly the person who came up with that slogan was one of the many unexpected connections I have made with people who support my campaign and my vision. They believe I will do my best to make good on my belief that we need to teach the skills to succeed to all students conservative or liberal black white or any other skin color.  I believe America is still the land of opportunity and part of that opportunity is teaching children how to succeed in life. We need to teach our children how to provide for themselves and find their way in the world with honor and dignity. I dont believe that is a conservative value nor a liberal value its a human value. But how do we do this?  To make true advancements in our schools we must be focus on what will enable our students to succeed in life. I believe there are three practical things we can do.  1. Expand our career and technical education 2. Professional development for teachers 3. Public-private partnerships  Expand our career and technical education.  We need to better enable those entering the workforce directly with the skills direction and entrepreneurial spirit to enter apprenticeships in high-demand trades. Students need someone to believe in them and show them the way. We need to continue and grow the work already started at Sabin-Schellenberg.  We must enable all students with the know-how to secure family wage jobs through partnerships with businesses and trade organizations that need skilled employees.  Professional development for teachers  We are about to be hit by a tsunami of learning loss mental health needs and life-changing trauma from this year of distance learning. There are funds that are available to help deal with this from the various federal stimulus packages. We must ensure our teachers have every tool they need to meet students' needs when they return to full day on-site school.  Public-private partnerships  Public private partnerships feed directly into expanding our career and technical education. We must partner with private organizations trade unions and companies to establish school to career pathways where students can connect with real employers prior to graduation. Public-Private Partnerships are the next step in preparing our students to succeed.",political,Facebook

The lives that were lost and the families that were affected are in my thoughts and prayers today to which 20 years felt like yesterday.  I also remember a sense of UNITY from every single person in sight. The love was real and hurt was burning inside.  One question?  Where did that sense of unity for us Americans go? Were all in this together and weve all felt the pain of that day and dont tell laying in the back of your mind in that day you wanted to immediately seek those who were responsible. I sure did.  Yes we have a difference of opinions at times but that should not deter us from getting along. Thats whats great about America the freedom of choice and the freedom of opinion.

"This is a compelling testimony delivered by Billys closest former staff at Devereux Jessica Gustafson Subject: Fwd: Billy Cray's Bill   IMG_2549.HEIC  IMG_2549.HEIC  Begin forwarded message: Subject: Fwd: Billy Cray's Law  IMG_2549.HEIC -------- Original IMG_2549.HEIC  Dear Chairwoman Downey and members of the Assembly Human Services Committe  My name is Jessica Gustafson. I am a former employee of Devereux. I was employed there for almost two years. Most of those two years I worked at the Euclid home located in Somers Point NJ. Euclid is were I meant William ""Billy"" Cray but this was not the first time I heard of him. During orientation we were warned about Billy. The told us that he was aggressive and often lied about being abused by staff. I was so nervous walking through the front door of Euclid for the first time based of what I was told. It was about a month in that I started to realize the truth. Billy was not this monster they made us believe he was and he definitely was not a lair. The abuse was real. Instead of warning staff Devereux should have been warning Billy's parents about the treatment he received under their care. The Cray's made the decision to place their son at with Devereux believing it was in his best interest. Unfortunately that was not the case and we are all here now trying to help pass Billy Cray's Law(Assembly Bill 4013). Billy was often the center of abuse not just physically but also mentally. He was viewed and treated differently because in my opinion he could tell the truth and no one wanted to take it serious. For an example when another client was in the hospital Devereux sent out an email to all staff in the area encouraging us to go visit him. When Billy was at Ancora I went with my supervisor to visit him. I need to stress the fact it was not on company time. Both myself and my supervisor received phone calls telling us that we were not allowed to visit Billy again. Billy was not clumsily or accident prone but he would regularly come home from the day prog with at least one new bruise set times a week. I once walked in on an employee holding Billy's face down on a couch. When I tried to tell someone I was told it was in fact Billy's doing. One morning most of Euclid staff was at the house for a staff meeting. We all came in to see a hole in the wall. We were told there was an incident with Billy and he had punced the wall. That was a great story but not the truth by any means. You see the hole was huge. I stated the fact the story did not add up and one could clearly see it was a body that made the hole. I was told to shut up because they higher ups were there. The whole was so big that when it was time for state inspection the whole was covered with a picture that took up the whole wall. Reporting abuse was frowned upon by Devereux and if they found out you could lose your job. I wish I did report it to the state and I will regret not doing so forever but I needed my job just like others employed there. It was maybe four or five month before Billy's death that I received pictures via text of Billy and his body covered in bruised. Since I no longer feared losing my job I called the state of NJ. I was pressured to give my information which at this point I could careless who knew I called. I could maybe right my wrong for not calling before. To describe the pictures I received to someone I would say it looked like Billy was being initiated into a gang. It broke my heart but not as much when I received the phone call that Billy had passed. The first words out of my mouth was they killed him and in my heart I still believe that. While i will never know exactly happens that dreadful day I do know had their been cameras in the home it could have been prevented or at the very least give his parents the answers to their questions! Cameras should be installed in every hospital  nursing and group home in America. While abuse may never go away completely cameras would definitely decrease the amount of abuse. The men and women that have to leave in a group home as the right to feel safe and not fear being abuse. We go into their homes to work and our privacy should be the least of anyone's worries. In my opinion the only reason an employee would object to cameras is because they have something to hide. I am begging you to please pass this law in Billy's name to stop the next death!!

Defunding The Police And Vaccine Mandates What's really behind it  Mile High Houndog 17 hr ago Have you ever asked yourself how could anyone possibly believe that defunding the police is a good Idea or why do we need vaccine mandates if the vaccine works? I mean if it works how can someone infect you right? Or if it works so well that should be enough to convince people to take it. Either way a mandate isnt needed. What I believe is happening here is the government is weeding out people who are free thinkers and not blind followers which leaves people that arent free thinkers and will do whatever the Government says. Same thing in the military they are getting rid of soldiers that might question immoral or illegal orders. When you have blind followers who dont question you thats how you take over a country.  I have long said that for the Antichrist to rise and the mark to be instituted America has to be taken down. Not by war but from the inside and that is exactly what I see happening right now. Kudos to all the people including law enforcement who are sacrificing their jobs to do what is right. However that also means that there is no one left in those jobs that will stand up for us. It leaves only the loyal in power and that is a very scary scenario.,political,Facebook

The United States of America helped win World War 1 and won and beat Hitler and Nazism and the Japanese imperialists in World War 2. The U.S. helped millions of Eastern Europeans gain freedom from the tyrannical Soviet Union and the brutal Communist regimes. It prevented South Korea from having to share the terrible fate that rules North Korea. Without the U.S. the world would be a different place. It would be a terrible world with dictatorships and global tyranny in most countries. Yet this superpower just left a country Afghanistan in the most unprofessional incompetent manner possible. This happened after 20 years of blood sweat and tears and trillions of American taxpayer money. Why did this happen ? It happened because of a mentally deranged and disturbed incompetent leader who is stricken by dementia and mental disabilities with an inflated ego. He left his people as hostages. The U.S. Had military personnel and bases and airport control and 300000 Afghani military men and women with billions of modern weapons. It voluntarily gave up this position of control to the Taliban a terrorist organization. VOLUNTARILY ! It did this before evacuating American citizens and Afghani allies and taking all the lates weaponry. ! Biden took the worst option possible. The complete truth about what happened and why is not clear yet but Biden truly screwed up and made another secret deal with the Taliban and the Chinese. This man is truly callous and a murderous traitor. He has abandoned Americans and Afghani aliies for political reasons. He does not care about human life even his own people. He lies with every opportunity and has his people lie too. Biden took a position of complete power and control and exchanged it with a position of weakness and lack of control and chaos and is dependent on a terrorist regime for the fate of Americans abandoned there.

"DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM  I am a democratic socialist lowercase intended. Most who engage this Page are of a fairly conservative persuasion. Consequently the above statement is likely to generate controversy. But that is not the intent of the statement. The intent of the statement is to provide an opportunity to state what it means to be a democratic socialist untarnished by a false portrayal of the term by those with an agenda which runs contrary to the broad mass of the American people.  First let me say to my conservative brothers and sisters I understand many of your positions. I am from a family which are conservative fundamentalists Christian on one side while the other side is best described as liberal establishment. I know both sides to be loving people authentic in their hearts and are well-intended with regards to the future of our Nation. I understand where both sides are coming from.  I consider myself however a part of neither of the above camps although certainly my thoughts are more closely aligned with the liberal establishment. But I reject the liberal establishment as they like the conservative fundamentalists defend an economic system: capitalism which is premised on materialism and competition both of which have led us to devalue human life in favor of soul sapping endless consumption rather than strong national and international communities. Both of the major U.S. political parties support war Wall Street big business and both continue to support a capitalist ideology which creates many of the divisions within our Nation.  For this reason I am a democratic socialist. To many the term socialism is deemed as a threat to one's freedom. But this threat does not exist so let's clear-up this misperception. For most people who are content with their daily lives who work regular jobs who own small businesses democratic socialism is not a threat to your freedom or way of life. I know of no one who wants to take away your small businesses: that would be both inefficient and undemocratic--small businesses are often defined as businesses with 500 or fewer employees.  There comes a point in time however when a business becomes so large that their largeness is no longer a mere reflection of the firm's merit but is a demonstration of an ability by large corporate enterprise to successfully leverage the Nation's assets: assets which they did not build i.e. education transportation networks security apparatuses culture: public assets for which the public should receive an equitable return on investment. Are CEOs on Wall Street at the tech giants the auto firms and elsewhere really worth tens of millions in annual compensation? Perhaps to their specific firm yes; but to the broader national economy? Are not restaurant workers worth more than their measly wage and do not auto and steel plant workers deserve a greater share of the National product? These are the issues which democratic socialist seek to address.  Democratic socialism is a highly nuanced term and there are as many interpretations of the title as there are people who think about it. To date unfortunately the term socialism has misleadingly been defined by those most threatened by the movement: the well-off and the upper management class. They would have us believe that socialism in America would look like that which occurred in the former Soviet Union which was not democratic or in modern day Cuba or Venezuela whose success or non success we will never be able to judge because they were unable to operate free of being undermined by the U.S. other western nations and reactionary forces within their own borders. Any movement towards a socialist system will develop out of the historical forces then present in the given society. In the U.S. this will involve markets and strong civil liberties. The thing that would fundamentally change is a desire to create a system which works for the entire population with a recognition that capitalism's individual survival-of-the-fittest mindset will not get us there.  Socialism seeks greater democracy not less. It seeks to shift power downward towards the middle and poorer classes. To my democratic socialist way of thinking ""the people"" should share control over the J.P. Morgans Citigroups Goldman Sachs . . . Googles and General Motors of the world. This would shift the center of power away from the well-off who due to their wealth exercise a degree of power and control over the Nation which far exceeds the power of their individual votes. This is both undemocratic and unhealthy. The undemocratic concentration of power among the well-off needs to be pushed downward towards the middle and poorer classes and this can only be accomplished if this grouping owns a significant chunk of these large corporations. Equity ownership in these firms with board representation will enable public oversight of these massive firms which daily impact our lives. By default stock ownership with board representation in these large firms will enable greater democratic control over the future of the Nation.  It seems to me that the most efficient way to achieve broader control over these large and powerful economic bodies which have successfully leveraged public assets and average people is through federal ownership stakes in large business enterprises. Perhaps there are better ways to restructure the ownership of these firms but given our current institutional framework federal ownership stakes in large corporations seems to be the quickest path to a more equitable power sharing arrangement. If you have alternative ideas feel free to comment on them. Democratic socialism does not seek to limit your freedoms it seeks to strengthen your freedoms through shifting power from the top tiers of society into the hands of middle and poorer classes through ownership stakes in large powerful private institutions.  Let me state clearly there is no effort here to impugn the character of the rich or wealthy. They like the rest of us are subjects of ideology and circumstances which largely direct our trajectories. I would no more judge a wealthy person than I would judge a crack cocaine dealer on the street. None of us can peer into another's heart. We are talking about systemic issues: foundational ideas which shape the world. As a nation we spend far too much time judging individual members of the opposition rather than in judgement of the broad ideological forces which drive human behavior.  Democratic socialist want strong civil liberties full employment and an assured decent standard of living for all. We do not want to raise tax rates on the middle classes. If this requires redistribution from those who have received a far greater share than what they have individually contributed to the National economy I don't see a problem with this. They after all have been redistributing wealth and income away from the middle and poorer classes for decades. If we are to call ourselves a nation then there must be something we share in common other than national boundaries; we should equitably share power and the National product. We and our ancestors have all contributed to America Inc. this includes the unemployed which have wrongly to date served to keep wage rates down in order to facilitate corporate profits: wage rates which are dictated through monetary policy by the Nation's central bank--the Federal Reserve.  Democratic socialism does not seek to limit your freedoms it seeks to strengthen your freedoms through shifting power from the top tiers of society into the hands of the middle and poorer classes through ownership stakes in large powerful private institutions. It is the democratic thing to do.",political,Facebook

It may come as a surprise to many but 2 million people in the United States lack access to basic plumbing. While innovations in toilets continue to rise to the surface  and continue to be a key point of focus for our design and engineering teams  these toilets ultimately sit atop an infrastructure system that is broken and in great need of repair.  Earlier this year the U.S. Chamber and the Bipartisan Policy Center along with a large group of diverse business policy and labor organizations launched the Build by the Fourth of July campaign urging Congress to enact a fiscally and environmentally responsible infrastructure package by the Fourth of July. LIXIL Americas continues to support the hundreds of other national and local organizations calling on Congress to pass comprehensive infrastructure legislation.

"Class is in session. Stand. Pledge. Sit. Topic: Critical race theory.  I have had quite a few people messaging me to ask questions about what critical race theory (CRT) is. As you know I have been taking a bit of a break but I wanted to go ahead and research the topic so I could report back and actually have the facts.  What is critical race theory?  Critical race theory quite simply is the study of how racism is embedded in American laws and institutions. Specifically its core idea is that racism is a social construct that is not only the product of individuals and their own biases but it is also something that is embedded in legal systems and policies. It includes the study of political power social organization and language.  Where did race theory come from?  Critical race theory was a framework for legal analysis in the ladder part of the 1970s and into the early part of the 1980s created by legal scholars Derrick Bell Kimberle (yes with an e) Crenshaw and Richard Delgado.  In the early 1980s students of color at Harvard Law School organized protests regarding Harvard's lack of racial diversity in the curriculum among students and in the faculty. These students supported Professor Derrick Bell who left Harvard Law in 1980 and then became the dean at University of Oregon School of Law. During his time at Harvard Bell had developed new courses that studied American law through a racial lens. Harvard students of color wanted faculty of color to teach the new courses in his absence. Bell resigned his position at Harvard because of what he viewed as the university's discriminatory practices.  Can you give me an example?  Sure. In the 1930s for instance government officials literally drew lines around certain areas deemed to be poor financial ricks most often specifically for the racial composition of its inhabitants. Banks would often times refuse to offer mortgages to the African Americans in these areas. Today these policies still exist via policies like single family zoning that prevents the building of affordable housing in advantages neighborhoods that majority white.  This academic understanding of critical race theory differs from representation in recent popular books and especially from its portrayal by criticsoften though not exclusively conservative Republicans. Critics charge that the theory leads to negative dynamics such as a focus on group identity over universal shared traits; divides people into oppressed and oppressor groups; and urges intolerance (Sawchuk 2021).  Give me another example.  Absolutely! Take the landmark case Brown v. Board of Education for example in which the Supreme Court ruled in 1954 that separate is not equal and that state laws protecting segregated public schools are unconstitutional. While the ruling gave Black children the right to attend schools that had long prohibited them it also resulted in some white families enrolling their children in private schools moving to the suburbs or redrawing school district boundaries in an effort to resist integration.  What does this have to do with our schools?  Scholars who study CRT in education examine how policies and practices in K-12 education are a contributor to persistent racial inequalities in matters such as education and advocate ways to change them. Topics of study include racially segregated schools underfunding of majority black and latino school districts barriers to gifted programs and selective admission high schools. Many educators support culturally relevant teaching and other strategies to make schools feel safe and supporting for African American students and other underserved populations. However these educators do not necessarily identify these activities as CRT related.  Critical race theory is NOT taught in K-12 schools instead it is taught in law schools.  Can you just lay it on the table for me?  Sure. A recent poll by the advocacy group Parents Defending Education claimed some schools were teaching that white people are inherently privileged while Black and other people of color are inherently oppressed and victimized; that achieving racial justice and equality between racial groups requires discriminating against people based on their whiteness; and that the United States was founded on racism. Thus much of the current debate appears to spring not from the academic texts but from fear among critics that studentsespecially white studentswill be exposed to supposedly damaging or self-demoralizing ideas.  Why Are People Talking About Critical Race Theory and the 1619 Project Right Now?  The term critical race theory began gaining traction in the mainstream two years ago  or notoriety depending on people's outlook  after The New York Times published the 1619 Project a compilation of essays commentaries and poems that brought the idea of critical race theory out of academia for the first time by asking readers to center the consequences of slavery and the contributions of Black Americans in the country's national narrative.  The project's orchestrator Nikole Hannah-Jones won a Pulitzer Prize for the moving personal essay she wrote  the introduction to the package  about her father a veteran and why he flew an American flag in their front yard and was proud to be American when what she saw as a little girl was a country that used and then abandoned him.  While the project was widely hailed it also irked many people who argued that it put ideology before historical accuracy as well as a handful of prominent academic scholars who challenged some of the package's guiding principles including that colonists fought the Revolutionary War in order to preserve slavery and that slavery was a uniquely American enterprise.  Political conservatives in particular found the darker portrayal of America's origins and its shortcomings galling saying that it undercut patriotism and had a divisive effect. Former President Donald Trump found it especially insulting. ""Critical race theory the 1619 Project and the crusade against American history is toxic propaganda ideological poison that if not removed will dissolve the civic bonds that tie us together will destroy our country"" he said about it at the time. Months following the 1619 Project's publication Trump convened the ""1776 Commission"" to counter the narrative and develop a ""patriotic"" curriculum that schools can use to teach U.S. history. The commission published a 41-page report two days before the end of the Trump administration which concluded among other things that progressivism is at odds with American values and recommended that schools teach positive stories about the country's founders (Camera 2021).  I heard this is something called a wedge issue. What is that?  A wedge issue is a political or social issue often of a controversial or divisive nature which splits apart a demographic or population group. Wedge issues can be advertised or publicly aired in an attempt to strengthen the unity of a population with the goal of enticing polarized individuals to give support to an opponent or to withdraw their support entirely out of disillusionment. The use of wedge issues gives rise to wedge politics. Wedge issues are also known as hot button or third rail issues.  Who came up with this?  This issue has been developed primarily by a man named Christopher Rufo. Rufo is an American conservative activist and the director of several documentary films. ... He is known for his activism against CRT which he says ""has pervaded every aspect of the federal government"" poses ""an existential threat to the United States"" and is anti-American.  Why is he making such an issue out of this?  Because it is divisive. Rufo says the goal is to have the public read something crazy in the newspaper and immediately think critical race theory. We have to codify the term and reccodify it to annex the entire range of cultural constructions that are unpopular with America. We will eventually turn it toxic as we put all of the various cultural under that brand category.  That is what this is all about ladies and gentleman.  EXTRA CREDIT  FACT: Stephen Bannon thinks the GOP could gain 50 House seats if they focus on critical race theory.  Class dismissed.",political,Facebook

20 years ago today America woke up after suffering the worst terrorist attack on American soil ever. We were not Democrats or Republicans or hyphenated citizens. We were proud Americans! We overcame our differences and we shared our outrage and pledged to seek justice for the nearly 3000 innocent Americans that lost their lives that terrible day. We bought flags. We joined the Armed Forces. We grieved with the families of those lost. We volunteered like never before. We started scholarship funds for the families of the victims. For many it was the America that we read about in history classes about the World Wars.  Somehow we have lost that.  As we remember those lost on 9-11 and the Service Members and Civilians lost fighting terrorism since then let us endeavor to get back to being the best country we can be and start looking out for our neighbors and friends again. Let us join forces to do what is right for everyone not just ourselves. Let us honor those we lost by remembering their sacrifices as well as those that are sacrificing to help us get through the pandemic.  Lets all become proud Americans again.,political,Facebook
"BEFORE EMBRACING AMERICA-FIRST AGENDA DAVID PERDUE WAS AN OUTSOURCING EXPERT  (Share if you believe that Georgians should know the sad truth about their Senator DA2020)  Mr. Perdue who faces one of two runoff elections in Georgia that will determine control of the Senate built a business record that shifted manufacturing and jobs overseas.  By Stephanie Saul Richard Fausset and Michael LaForgia  Jan. 1 2021 Updated 1:24 p.m. ET  The biographical video from Senator David Perdues first campaign in 2014 celebrated a narrative arc that many fellow Georgians either related to or have aspired to: the story of a humble boy from rural America whose hard work catapulted him into a global business career navigating free markets and faraway lands all the while gathering stores of wisdom and wealth.  The embrace of global commerce has been a hallmark of modern Georgia showcased in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics dissected by the novelist Tom Wolfe and promoted by among others Mr. Perdues Nafta-loving cousin Sonny Perdue governor from 2003 to 2011. Three years later in his maiden run for office David Perdue would boast of his international experience as a consultant and chief executive while speaking to a gathering of Republicans in Bibb County close to his middle Georgia hometown.  Theres only one candidate in this race thats ever lived outside the United States Mr. Perdue said. How can you bring value to a debate about the economy unless you have any understanding about the free-enterprise system and what it takes to compete in the global economy?  Now facing one of a pair of Jan. 5 runoff elections in Georgia that will determine control of the Senate Mr. Perdue has continued to make his global business experience the essence of his brand. But that has highlighted the contradictions that emerge  in his career and in his character but also in his party and his region  as he embraces the populist America-first strains of Trumpism.  The man who has lately voiced support for some of President Trumps signature tariffs built his career as an unapologetic free-trading practitioner of the outsourcing arts. As a top executive at companies including Reebok Sara Lee and Dollar General he was often deeply involved in the shift of manufacturing and jobs to low-wage factories in China and other Asian countries.  A review of that business record shows a man who achieved significant successes making millions managing complex periods of corporate growth and change and creating domestic jobs particularly at Dollar General. But there were also disappointments like the failed trucking business he ran with Sonny Perdue and his fruitless effort to rescue a company called Pillowtex that brought heartbreak to a North Carolina mill town. And while the senator often speaks of having led the Reebok turnaround as president of the companys flagship brand in the early 2000s he moved on from the company after a rival who today questions Mr. Perdues contribution to the turnaround was installed above him.  The man who spent much of his life broadening his horizons took to the stage at a Trump rally in Macon before Election Day and mocked Senator Kamala Harriss first name mispronouncing it with an exaggerated stumble that to critics amounted to crude racism. His campaign has called it an innocent mispronunciation.  The man who dons a faded denim jacket to reinforce his connection to everyday Georgians has a record of aloofness with an aversion to holding town hall meetings and a thin skin for tough questions. Now he has chosen a further withdrawal declining to participate in additional debates after one in which his Democratic opponent Jon Ossoff called him a crook for his prolific stock-trading while in the Senate.  Mr. Perdue did not respond to requests to be interviewed for this article. In response to written questions his campaign issued a statement that said in part Throughout his four decades working in the real world before being elected to the Senate David Perdue led American companies that saved and created tens of thousands of American jobs.  As when he first ran for office six years ago Mr. Perdue who is 71 regularly invokes those decades in business to style himself the ultimate Washington outsider though it was his cousin the former governor who gave him his entree to politics and helped nurture his ascent.  Taking aim at his 33-year-old opponent who runs a London-based documentary film company and has never held public office Mr. Perdues campaign has fixed on a $1000 payment from a Hong Kong media company to charge that Mr. Ossoff had a two-year working relationship with the Chinese Communist Party.  In its statement to The New York Times most of which dwelled on Mr. Ossoff the Perdue campaign called it ridiculous to compare the senators leadership in American companies with Jon Ossoffs foreign-owned company with shady ties to the Chinese government. (Mr. Ossoffs spokeswoman dismissed that claim as one of the most laughable smear campaigns in Georgia history.)  Mr. Perdues campaigns biographical video meanwhile has been refreshed for 2020. Edited out is a section that showed the senator posing with his wife on Chinas Great Wall.  From a Watermelon Patch to the World Mr. Perdue grew up in Warner Robins a small city about 100 miles south of Atlanta home to Robins Air Force Base. Airmen coming and going from foreign deployments connected the city to the wider world.  But life could still move to rural rhythms. Mr. Perdue traces his roots back to nearby Bonaire a farming community where Perdues settled in the early 1800s. Mr. Perdue recalls picking watermelons on a family-owned farm alongside Sonny who would become Mr. Trumps agriculture secretary in 2017.  While farming was a family pursuit Mr. Perdues parents followed a different path  education. David Perdue Sr. eventually became county schools superintendent.  Mr. Perdue would later go on to extol his fathers leadership in desegregating the countys schools but the historical record provides a different picture revealing the school system employed delay tactics until the N.A.A.C.P. sued and a court ordered it to comply.  The future senator graduated from high school in 1968 two years before the schools were fully integrated. Standout student varsity athlete and class president he was awarded a coveted appointment to the Air Force Academy.  David has those personal traits that cause him to be recognized as a person of worth his high school principal Milton Sutherlin wrote in a recommendation letter. His character is that always of a gentleman and he holds high those Christian ideals that speak well of his home training his school and his community.  But while the Air Force would prove a good fit for his cousin Sonny who served three years and was promoted to the rank of captain it was not so for David. He received Bs and Cs in a brief stint at the academy and by early 1969 let it be known that he wanted out.  I have realized that I have made a mistake and I do not want this type of career he wrote in January 1969 to Jack Brinkley the congressman who had sponsored him. His plan was to attend the Georgia Institute of Technology and try to play basketball.  His basketball career never materialized but Mr. Perdue would earn undergraduate and masters degrees at Georgia Tech. And over the next three decades he would position himself on the winning side of a seismic economic shift sweeping the South.  A Global Man of the New South Increasingly and inexorably the regions apparel and textile industry was turning to foreign contractors to manufacture its products. The disruption which meant thousands of layoffs for low-skilled workers in Southern mill towns was Mr. Perdues ticket to the world. He became an expert in outsourcing.  I spent most of my career doing that he would later say in a deposition.  His apprenticeship in outsourcing began while he was still in school. In 1972 he joined Kurt Salmon Associates a consulting company that had earned its reputation sending bright young engineers into Southern clothing factories to solve technical problems and boost efficiency. The company had a large Atlanta office and by the 1970s was aspiring to a more-global footprint.  The city was too. Born as a regional railroad hub Atlanta had begun adding international flights to its growing airport creating yet more opportunities for a metropolis that had already rocketed past its Southern rivals fueled by relentless civic boosterism and a reputation for racial moderation.  William Sand an engineer who worked in the Atlanta office with Mr. Perdue recalled that in the 1970s as Southern factories were beginning to close new ones were opening in Mexico and Asia. Kurt Salmon he said became experts at helping companies source product from overseas.  Mr. Perdue left in 1984 and worked at a few other places before ending up at Sara Lee which was best known for its baked goods but was also an apparel manufacturer. He was hired in 1992 to open a headquarters in Hong Kong where he lived for two years establishing operations throughout Asia from the ground up he would later say.  The ripple effects reached home. In 1994 the company eliminated thousands of jobs including 230 at its Spring City Knitting plant in Cartersville Ga. Most of the workers were women who earned $4.25 an hour sewing garments.  By that time Mr. Perdue was globe-trotting with yet another company Haggar Clothing which had chosen him to lead its international operation with one aim  increasing foreign sourcing. Within three years he had done just that boosting international production from 60 percent to 75 percent. As company plants were closed in the United States workers in Mexico performed the job for $1.50 an hour.  By 1998 Mr. Perdue was headed to Reebok which ultimately promoted him to lead its main division as it forged licensing deals with the National Football League and the National Basketball Association. Major league teams with their star power and marquee players burnished Reeboks cachet leading to its acquisition by Adidas in 2005. The manufacturing of most of the companys products was outsourced primarily to China and elsewhere in Asia.  The 2014 video produced by Mr. Perdues Senate campaign  in which he discusses licensing agreements  portrays him as the architect of Reeboks turnaround. Even in the wake of improvements in the companys business though Reeboks chairman Paul Fireman passed over Mr. Perdue for promotion to the companys No. 2 job.  In December 2001 the company announced that Mr. Perdue who as head of the Reebok brand had reported directly to Mr. Fireman would instead report to Jay Margolis who had formerly headed other brands for the company but was suddenly named chief operating officer.  Paul Fireman decided he wanted one guy to run it all from a C.O.O. point of view said Kenneth Watchmaker Reeboks chief financial officer until 2006. Thats where the two of them competed and Jay got the nod and David left after a period of time.  Mr. Margolis says that he and Mr. Fireman actually pushed out Mr. Perdue who has characterized his departure from Reebok as voluntary. I look back on David. He couldnt make decisions. He was so indecisive he couldnt move the product forward Mr. Margolis said.  As for the licensing deals Mr. Margolis said those were the brainchild of Mr. Fireman.  Mr. Fireman reached by phone said I dont remember firing him. He added: Im not challenging Jays recollection; I just dont remember myself.  Mr. Fireman did not address a question about the extent to which Mr. Perdue was involved in turning around the brands. A long time has passed since then he said. David was a good solid employee for the four or five years he was with me at a high level Mr. Fireman said. And I knew him as a good person.  Within months of Mr. Margoliss promotion Mr. Perdue was in discussions with a headhunter seeking an executive with the know-how and experience to turn around Pillowtex a troubled sheet and towel manufacturer with well-known brands in its portfolio including Cannon Fieldcrest and Royal Velvet.  Leaving behind what he would later describe as $5 million worth of in-the-money unvested Reebok stock options Mr. Perdue agreed in spring 2002 to take the job as chief executive of Pillowtex.  The company was just emerging from bankruptcy and thousands of workers at its home base in Kannapolis N.C. viewed Mr. Perdue as a potential savior according to Scott Shimizu a former executive vice president. Looking back though Mr. Shimizu said he believed Mr. Perdues inaction led to the companys demise.  The company needed to sell off assets quickly and outsource production to survive  with the possibility of retaining part of its United States work force  but Mr. Shimizu says Mr. Perdue took few steps to do either.  He didnt really help us said Mr. Shimizu. We were waiting for him to bring the Ten Commandments to us. They never came.  Mr. Perdue would later say he had been misled about the depth of the companys financial problems including a badly underfunded pension plan. He became embroiled in a dispute with Pillowtex over its failure to live up to the compensation agreement he had negotiated.  The company imploded and about 7650 people lost their jobs most of them in North Carolina. The Charlotte Observer called it the largest mass layoff in state history. The hard feelings toward Mr. Perdue were rife in Kannapolis and in 2014 his Democratic Senate opponent Michelle Nunn would release an ad set there highlighting the bitterness.  Mr. Perdue who had been at Pillowtex less than a year soon found a new opportunity that would also touch large numbers of working-class people: at Dollar General. The company boasts that 25 percent of its products retail for less than $1.  As chief executive Mr. Perdue oversaw the opening of a Hong Kong office in 2004 increasing the global sourcing that helps to provide the low everyday price our customers count on according to a company announcement. Among the global sources were manufacturers in China records show.  Low wages were another way the company controlled costs. Store managers sued the company complaining that they were not paid overtime even though they took on nonmanagerial duties unloading trucks and stocking shelves after hours. Some of their claims as well as legal complaints from female workers who said they were inequitably compensated resulted in payouts.  Dollar General flourished under Mr. Perdues leadership adding more than 2000 stores and expanding the use of coolers to stock more grocery items. Former colleagues who visited Mr. Perdue at the companys Tennessee headquarters said it was apparent he was preparing Dollar General for acquisition. In 2007 Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company announced it would purchase Dollar General for about $7 billion. It was later reported that Mr. Perdue walked away with a $42 million payout.  The Perdue family had lived in Nashvilles tony Belle Meade section but it was time to head back to Georgia where Mr. Perdue would ultimately settle on Sea Island a wealthy sanctuary on the southern coast.  The Outsider In 2010 as Sonny Perdue was finishing his second term as governor he named his cousin David to the board of the Georgia Ports Authority.  About a year later records show the cousins formed a company called Perdue Partners which in December 2012 acquired Benton Express an Atlanta-based trucking company that had operated as a regional family business for nearly 80 years. They renamed it Benton Global and pledged to reinvigorate the business by drawing on overseas connections and especially David Perdues ties to Asia according to press reports and interviews with former employees.  The Perdues installed two loyalists of the former governor in top management positions and oversaw the purchase of new tractor-trailers. But the promised new international business never materialized and the company already suffering from flagging revenues struggled to pay its bills. It closed abruptly in 2015 leaving more than 500 truck drivers clerks and terminal workers unemployed.  As a member of the ports authority board Mr. Perdue voted repeatedly on infrastructure improvements that might have benefited his trucking business The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. A spokesman for Mr. Perdue said at the time that none of the votes posed a conflict of interest or aided Mr. Perdue financially.  In 2013 Georgias senior senator Saxby Chambliss announced that he would not stand for re-election the next year. In David Perdues telling he drove to see his cousin and tried to convince him to run. Well he told me he didnt feel led to do so but then he said I should consider running Mr. Perdue later recalled in an interview.  When Mr. Perdue decided to run he recruited top aides from his cousins campaign staff. Davids team was Sonnys team said Jack Kingston a longtime Republican congressman who also sought the vacant seat. Sonny Perdue he said was very instrumental in his cousins campaign.  For all that David Perdue branded himself the outsider the man with the real-world business savvy needed to effect change. The Republican primary was crowded with well-known and seasoned politicians and Mr. Perdue attacked them for their seasoning portraying them in ads as ineffectual mewling babies.  ""We were hoping that we could find an Achilles heel  hes lazy hes going to say something stupid Mr. Kingston said of the campaign. We found him to be pretty disciplined and hard-working. I have to give him good marks.  After defeating Mr. Kingston in a primary runoff Mr. Perdue went on to face Ms. Nunn an executive at a nonprofit whose father Sam Nunn was a former Democratic senator from Georgia. Though both candidates benefited from famous family names Ms. Nunn thought she might gain the upper hand by focusing on the negative effects of Mr. Perdues embrace of globalism.  A month before the election a transcript surfaced of a nine-year-old deposition in which Mr. Perdue said he had spent most of my career outsourcing. Questioned by reporters Mr. Perdue replied that he was proud of that record. This is a part of American business part of any business he said adding People do that all day.  Ms. Nunn pressed the point in her ads and on the debate stage. But she was the underdog and 2014 proved to be a bad year for Democrats burdened by a lack of enthusiasm for President Barack Obama and his signature legislation the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Perdue blasted Mr. Obamas handling of the Ebola virus crisis and vowed to repeal Obamacare. He practically waltzed to victory.  The outsider arrived on Capitol Hill pushing a term-limit plan and railing against career politicians to the annoyance of his fellow Georgia Republican Senator Johnny Isakson according to two people familiar with the views of Mr. Isakson who had spent many years in politics and was gearing up for a third Senate run.  The record Mr. Perdue built was reliably conservative. He submitted a far-fetched  and critics said regressive  proposal to replace income taxes with sales taxes on goods and services. He proposed limits on the ability of immigrants to sponsor family members instead giving priority to college-educated young people with high-paying jobs.  In the beginning he also spoke and voted as one would expect a free trader to do. In 2015 he voted to give Mr. Obama enhanced powers to negotiate big trade agreements including the Trans-Pacific Partnership the most substantial trade accord since the North American Free Trade Agreement of the 1990s.  But Mr. Perdue was also early to see the potential in Mr. Trump who offered a kind of mirror reflection of Mr. Perdues own political persona as chief executive change agent. The two men reportedly met at Trump Tower during Mr. Perdues 2014 run. And after Mr. Trumps inauguration the senator could be unrestrained in his praise at one point comparing the new president to Winston Churchill. This guy I think is a historic person of destiny at a time and place in America when weve got to make a right-hand turn here Mr. Perdue said.  Mr. Perdue and his fellow Republicans quickly had to grapple with the presidents determination to break the partys mold on global trade. Three days into his tenure Mr. Trump tore up the Trans-Pacific Partnership calling it a rape of our country.  Although Mr. Perdues campaign has said that he consistently supported the presidents America-first trade policies the senator spoke out in 2017 against a Trump-backed plan to impose a border adjustment tax that would have raised taxes on companies that import goods into the United States. A year later he criticized the presidents plan to impose steep tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum calling for a more targeted strategy.  But by late 2019 as Mr. Perdues re-election bid on a ticket with Mr. Trump loomed he seemed more amenable to the presidents approach.  The tariffs are creating the opportunity for people to come to the table he said according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. For the first time in five decades we are standing up to the Chinese and other trading partners around the world and all we want is equal access and a level playing field.  The crosscurrents on trade could be tricky and suddenly Mr. Perdues globalist background made him susceptible to attacks from fellow conservatives. In September 2019 Lou Dobbs the powerful pro-Trump TV personality reported that Mr. Perdue and another senator were visiting Beijing where Mr. Dobbs warned they may well be undercutting U.S. and China trade negotiations and progress made by the president. Mr. Dobbs noted Mr. Perdues outsourcing record.  A day later Mr. Dobbs issued a correction noting that Mr. Trump had approved the trip.  The China Problem In 2016 Mr. Perdue had preached Republican unity as the divisive Mr. Trump began gaining ground in the G.O.P. primary. But the senator helped spark a civil war among Georgia Republicans in 2020 when he and his Georgia runoff-mate Senator Kelly Loeffler demanded the resignation of the states top elections official a Republican calling the election he oversaw an embarrassment.  More recently the senators supported a failed Texas lawsuit that would have blocked the election result in Georgia where President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. beat Mr. Trump by about 12000 votes and in three other states Mr. Trump lost.  The battle over Mr. Perdues Senate seat has been no less fierce. Mr. Ossoffs crook attack in a televised debate in October was based on disclosures that Mr. Perdue the Senates most prolific stock trader made a number of well-timed trades including in companies that could be affected by his committees votes. An investigation of some of Mr. Perdues stock dealings by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission ended without prosecution and Mr. Perdue has used those facts to argue that he has done nothing wrong.  Mr. Ossoff has revived criticism of Mr. Perdues outsourcing record. And the senator has also had to fend off charges of bigotry for both his mockery of Ms. Harriss name and an online campaign ad that showed a photo of Mr. Ossoff who is Jewish with a lengthened nose. Mr. Perdues campaign has called the image in the ad an accident caused by a filter applied by an outside vendor handling the graphic design.  For his part Mr. Perdues closing attack is in keeping with Republicans emerging argument that Democrats like Mr. Ossoff are too weak and in some cases too compromised to stand up to the threat of Chinese global dominance.  Mr. Ossoff Mr. Perdue contends is a radical left-winger with a grave China problem. He cites as proof a $1000 agreement that allowed a large media company in Hong Kong PCCW to rebroadcast a documentary Mr. Ossoffs company produced about the Islamic State.  Previous reports have characterized one of PCCWs investors China Unicom as a state-owned Chinese company a point Mr. Perdue has used in an effort to tie Mr. Ossoff to the Chinese Communist Party.  For two years he worked with the C.C.P. the senator said in a Fox News interview.  Mr. Perdue has said little about his own China ties.  In 1991 the year before he headed to Hong Kong to build Sara Lees Asian outsourcing operation from the ground up the company proudly announced a new foothold in Asia  a deal in Fuzhou China.  The joint venture Fujian Sara Lee Consumer Products manufactured toothpaste shampoo and other personal care products. It was partially owned by the Chinese government according to a report in The Chicago Tribune announcing the venture.  As the Fujian arrangement continued Mr. Perdue busied himself with building Sara Lees first centralized sourcing operation in Asia including in mainland China he said in a deposition in 2005. That involved lining up suppliers and overseeing quality control and human rights practices for the company which manufactured Hanes clothing among other things.  No American firm could have established such an operation in China at that time without dealing extensively with the government or the Communist Party industry experts said.  You dont just wander into China without central government and local party officials wanting to know what youre doing said Michael Posner a professor at New York Universitys Stern School of Business and a top human rights official during the Obama administration. Its a very controlled environment. And anybody there who is dealing with factories would have had to deal with that. (While some of its products remain on the market Sara Lee has since disbanded.)  This week The Times asked Mr. Perdues campaign if he had any other business involving the Chinese government.  The campaign declined to answer.  Kate Kelly and Jannat Batra contributed reporting. Susan Beachy Kitty Bennett and Sheelagh McNeill contributed research.  More on the Georgia Senate Races Democrats Georgia Hopes Rest on Jon Ossoff 33.

THE ANSWER TO OUR NATIONAL DISCORD Rev. Bill Banuchi  Racism anti-Semitism Black Lives Matter Critical Race Theory Socialism Vs. Capitalism it seems like the very fabric of America is being shredded torn apart to cause more division and confusion than I have seen in my lifetime spanning seven decades. Have we reached the zenith of American peace and prosperity? Are we destined to cultural and national decline repeating the history of so many great cultures throughout world history? The old adage is true. Sometimes you cant see the forest for the trees. The answer to almost all of our points of contention was already provided for us in the inspired wisdom of our founders when they gave us our traditional national motto: One Nation Under God.  In reality this is not the first time weve been here as a nation. In fact at our very founding we were thirteen distinct colonies with various religious ethnic and racial identities that presented real barriers to becoming united against the British monarchy and the most powerful military in the world at the time. Had we not been able to overcome our factions and differences there would never have been a United States of America. But there was a man by the name of George Whitefield who went up and down the east coast from Maine to Georgia seven times on horseback preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ and teaching Americans that regardless of the label over our church buildings we are all One in Christ. We are unified in our submission to the God of the Bible as He revealed himself in the life of His Son Jesus Christ. That is our common bond the bond that unites us as one people as Americans. Whitefield taught us that we are in fact One Nation Under God. And again during the Civil War when brother was fighting brother and we were almost torn into two very different cultures and ideas of human dignity and liberty. Yet after more than 700000 American lives were lost we were able to come back together as One Nation Under God.  Since the Pilgrims came here to advance the Christian Religion we continued to be the place where the world came to escape tyranny and deprivation--the normal state of human affairs. America was the exception. Immigrants came here willing to subordinate the culture they were leaving to adopt a new identity as Americans. In fact it was Teddy Roosevelt who told us in the midst of a wave of European migration that here in America there is no room for a hyphenated American for we are all Americans. We are One Nation Under God.  When my father came here from Puerto Rico in 1932 though Puerto Rico was an American territory he came to be in every way an American to learn English and to realize his potential as he could never do in his native land and this during the time of the Great Depression. My Dad never gave up his identity as a proud Puerto Rican but he was always more proud to be an American. He became a merchant marine and whether he worked alongside an Irishman a Jew or a Black man they were all AmericansOne Nation Under God.  My greatest concern for this present generation is that for the first time in our history one side of the cultural divide rejects the acknowledgement of the sovereignty of God. Even during the Civil War as horrendous as it was yet both sides were restrained by their understanding of the will of God imperfect as it was. Both sides recognized that there was a God in Heaven to whom they will be held accountable. They were both answerable to the same higher authority.  In todays national divide the left rejects the sovereignty of God. The Democrat National Convention in 2012 attempted to remove acknowledgment of God from their platform. Todays Democrat Party represents for the first time in American history a worldview that outwardly rejects the God of the Bible and places humanity in that position of the ultimate authority. There is however nothing new under the sun. This is simply the age-old demonic attempt to subvert the authority of God.  We the people of God must do two things to preserve the liberty our parents passed on to us. We must first pray like it all depends on God and secondly we must work like it all depends on us. In this nation of the people by the people and for the people we must raise our voices to communicate one clear message whenever we hear anyone referring to a particular group in order to set them apart for criticism or favor. We must assert the truth in love that we are One Nation Under God.  Yes one nation. Even President Lincoln reminded us of the Biblical truth that a house divided cannot stand. We are under God meaning that we do our best to live up to the creed expressed by the Father of our Country George Washington who told us; it is the duty of all Nations to acknowledge the providence of Almighty God to obey his will to be grateful for his benefits and humbly to implore his protection and favor  Thomas Jefferson echoed these sentiments when he said God who gave us life gave us liberty. And can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are of the Gift of God? That they are not to be violated but with His wrath?  We may debate what it means to be under God or what Gods will is for us; we may debate how His laws should apply to modern life but we dare not debate whether we are in fact under God and subject to His sovereignty unless we are ready to forego His favor. As people of the book we hold the words of life of truth and of freedom. It is up to us to answer every charge that seeks to divide us and to degrade us into tribalism. We must declare in one clear voice that we are One Nation Under God. That must be our battle cry for such a time as this. We must never tire of declaring it until it is once again the dominant view of what it is to be an American.  Just as George Whitefield was an instrument in the hand of God to bring on a Great Awakening by preaching this same message--Gods Word is the same yesterday today and forever--so will we see the Greatest Awakening when we boldly declare this eternal truth to an unbelieving generation and to the principalities of the air  His intent was that now through the church the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realmsEphesians 3:10  So let us vow to never let a charge of division go unanswered. Let us be determined to reject intimidation into silence but rather be prayerfully seeking the wisdom and prompting of the Holy Spirit to speak the truth in love the truth that we are One Nation Under God and nothing less. And I am convinced we will see The Greatest Awakening!,political,Facebook

Trauma is at the genesis of all societies ills my conclusion after reading the morning paper. Once again there is another child sexual assault case!  Domestic violence child sexual assault physical assault psychological/gaslighting abuse financial abuse abuse by the legal system to include courts judges and prisons abuse of religious beliefs and racism all result in trauma. Unleashed trauma destroys individuals by eroding self esteem confidence causes physical disabilities and diminishes personal power rendering individuals helpless. This collective trauma exponentially impacts society at large.  The healing of societies trauma requires a multidisciplinary team of policy makers. The complexity of trauma in all its forms requires a panel represented by the highest level of expertise in each discipline. And even with the existence of such expertise major challenges will remain.  Communication will be a major barrier. Each discipline has a specific construct or concept of understanding words and meanings based on their field of expertise. To bridge the construct gap will require the ultimate conveyor of the truth. Perhaps a philosopher needs to be included to facilitate the development of effective policies. This panel needs to convene immediately to counteract the devastation caused by societal trauma and to facilitate the healing of America.  To heal Americans need a living wage that automatically increases per parameters and provides for comfortable housing adequate food free health care to include mental illness and addictions affordable higher education in addition to well funded public schools.  Trauma must be replaced with healthy safe homes and our communities must provide citizens a way to meet their needs. If they are ill/incapacitated and unable to care for themselves communities must provide the resources necessary for every citizen to live a basic dignified life. For exampleI believe the covid pandemic has identified the importance of having universal health care sufficient medical professionals and educators.  Trauma needs to be eradicated it is at the root of all problems. Kindness caring and love of thy neighbor will go a long way in preventing many of societies atrocities. Especially toward our youngest citizens our children. Lets all become involved in the eradication of trauma.,political,Facebook
February 1st means its the start of Black History Month.  The fact that we still have a separate month to share the historic facts of a segment of Americas people is an indicator of the problem that exists in this country and has since the beginning.  Segregation. Why do we continue to segregate the Black people of our country? By keeping their history separate we do ourselves and everyone in this country a grave disservice. The history of Black America is the history of us all. The enslavement of Black people who would become part of our society the many Black people who led the way through words and actions during historical events the many Black people who stood as soldiers politicians suffragists these are all intricately woven throughout our history. Learning about the eugenics programs that caused the sterilization of Black people throughout the 20th century and inspired Hitler himself may be an ugly part of our history but it is a true part of our history. Eliminating it from the history books is to stop learning from our own past Abe to continue making the same mistakes as we keep living with hate in our society.  As long as we continue to separate the history of a part of our own people we will never truly be one nation and will never understand equality.  Its long past time to integrate Black History into our history altogether and eliminate the month as if needs to be considered separate or as if we are conferring some sort of honor upon the Black people by keeping their history separate. We arent. We are only continuing the horrible tradition of segregation and dishonoring them by forcing them to be kept to one sole month in which to even be remembered. Its time to stop the segregation game. #ISeeYourHearts,political,Facebook

BIDEN THE UNELECTED MAY THE COUNTRY SURVIVE Posted on August 16 2021 by richardboyanton The Afghanistan army the South Vietnam army and the South Korean military (maybe) are trained and supplied with the latest American technology and equipment; they only lack courage. The Italian Army attacked the Ethiopian army with the most advanced weapons of the second world war. Without the Germans the Italians would have been destroyed; it takes an army of courage. We must let these countries stand or fail on their own; having American soldiers do the fighting accomplishes nothing but the killing of young courageous American soldiers. GOD bless America and may we as a country defeat the insurrection of socialism.

#80: Dear White People  Having warrants for your arrest doesn't justify a state execution Arguing with the police doesn't justify a state execution Walking away from the police does not justify a state execution Talking loud does not justify a state execution Resisting arrest does not justify a state execution Running away from the police does not justify a state execution Having a criminal record does not justify a state execution  Nothing about Law and Order or the Rule of Law ya'll whine about so much justifies the execution of a citizen by the state....  - Gabarail Smith August 2020  A simple traffic violation Kids playing in the park Even a suspect WITH a registered firearm Military personnel driving to a lit area for a stop A sleeping couple A man on his couch eating ice-cream A teen leaving a convenience store A woman defending herself from unwanted touch / abuse / intruders A woman in her home shower  None of these scenarios REQUIRES public execution by Law Enforcement.  Uncommon Sense suggests that although some Americans would love to refute these sentiments with resentment and hostility that does NOT remove the stain of racism that exists in America. There is a segment of Americans who will continually and with vigor deny challenge and argue racism in America is a myth. That the actions of certain people deserve the treatment they receive. This was written almost a year ago and is still relevant. THAT is the problem. A problem that was the basis of the 1960s Civil Rights Movement. A problem that has not been fully satisfied or realized. Yet others still wish to keep equality from occurring (for others) as if it threatens their livelihood / properties / liberties / families / investments / education or their PRIVILEGE. Ego needs to be removed. Civil Rights are for all Americans. And if they ARE offered equally perhaps the need for armed police will be reduced as everyone will have a purpose in society in which they are valued. Value Americans. Period.  Consider a man who sells cigarettes on a corner had been given both a full education under the law without the burden of a huge student loan debt. A job that pays MORE than the minimum wage. He has credit to buy a home in a safe suburb. And can do his job with pride and raise his family. Consider a child who is playing in a park is left to play in the park. He can grow up to be a good citizen. Imagine 5 high school boys accused of a crime allowed leniency. Have them home with their families monitored schooled and fed. And when 20 years later they are exonerated are able to have lived within the community that gave them the chance to still have their childhoods in tact.  A system that fails a segment of its population is a failing democracy.,political,Facebook
TIME TO PREACH  First of all I am not a preachernot ordainedand not licensed! I am a follower of Christ and want to share what is on my heart. So lets call this a fifteen-minute sermonmaybe a little longer--dont hang up on me now. Maybe this will helpyou will not have to listen to a choir or praise teamno announcementsand more importantno offering!  You will not hear this type of sermon proclaimed from the pulpits of most churches in Americaonly a few.  Lets get serious and dig in. Folkswhat is going on in the world todayit is scary. What I want to share affects the whole worldbut I want to concentrate on Americathe good ole U.S.A.  To set the tone let me mention a number of news headlines we hear today.  Hot items: critical race theory; cancel culture; defund the police; Southern border crisis; wokism; socialism and Marxism; Green New Deal and climate change; big tech censorship and social media platforms; Wuhan lab leak CCP seeks to control America; and the Great Reset.  And a few recent headlines: Antifa BLM and White supremacists; suicide rate rises; 2020 election fraud; assault on Constitution and Bill of Rights; abortions cryptocurrencies LBGTQ; Biden and Harris Administration; Covid 19 vaccines and mandates; and the U.S. debt approaching $30 trillion.  Why all the liescorruptionlawlessnessself-interestpower struggleschasing the almighty dollarinjustice. Where are we heading as a nation? I am not an alarmistbut a realist. So lets look at Gods Word for an understanding.  May I be bold and bluntwhy this mess? Bottom lineit is Satan.  Lets reviewGod created Lucifera high and mighty angela cherubim. God created Lucifer and millions of angels prior to creating the earth. (Job 38:4-7) (Ezekiel 28:12-19)  Lucifer then sinned by attempting to become God and was filled with pride. (Isa 14:12-14 Ezekiel 28:15-17)  God pushed Lucifer and one-third of the angels from the Heaven of Heavens. (Luke 10:18 Revelation 12:49)  Lucifer became known as Satantempted Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. (Genesis 3:13)  Adam and Eve fell and sinned against Godas a result all mankind is born with a sin nature.  By the waySatan is alive and well today. Did you know that Satan still has restricted access to the heavenly realm? God has given Satan limited powers todayand it is temporary (Romans 16:20). 1 John 5:19 tells us that the whole world is under the control of the evil one the fallen angels and the demons.  Satan is gradually setting up a one world governmenthe has a controlled agenda. And most important to himhe is doing all he can to thwart Gods redemptive plan. And he is working overtime because he knows his time is short and coming to an end.  Lets now look at AmericaI believe we are a post Christian nation. We have thrown God out. Want proofhere is a partial list: remove prayer in public schools in 1962; remove Bible reading in public schools in 1963; abortion legalized in 1973; remove Ten Commandments from classroom in 1980; struck down sodomy law in 2003; ruled DOMA unconstitutional in 2013; and approved same sex marriages in 2015.  Satan has infiltrated the Halls of Congress The White House the Supreme Court schools and universities churches Hollywood the media and yesour homes.  Let me share some highlights of the Ninevah and Jerusalem principle written by Bill Salus in June 2016. This talks about Americas spiritual condition.  First the Ninevah experiencea story of hope found in Jeremiah 18:7-8 If at any time I announce that a nation or kingdom is to be uprooted torn down or destroyed and that nation I warned repents of its evil then I will relent and not inflict on it the disaster I had planned. God sent Jonah to warn the people of its impending destruction. The people of Ninevah turned from evil waysthe resultGod saw their works and relented from bringing disaster upon them (Jonah 3:410).  And the Jerusalem experiencea story of despair found in Jeremiah 18:9-10 And if at another time I announce that a nation or kingdom is to be built up or planted and if it does evil in my sight and does not obey me then I will reconsider the good I had intended to do for it. The nation of Judah reached a point of no return and the Lord determined that its destruction would not be postponed. In fact God told Jeremiah to stop praying for the people of Judah three times. The people of Judah forsook their God JehovahJeremiah 19:4-9 provides the indictment.  The Lord has provided ample warnings to America that the country is headed for destruction. When will God judge America? Is it happening now? What does your heart of hearts tell you?  Does America have a national repentance forthcoming? If yes America must resemble forgiven Ninevah. If no the Lord will no longer bless this nation and Americas greatness will never return. Only God knows Americas final verdict.  Lets turn our attention to mankind now. What about each of us as individualswe are born into sinwe each have a sinful nature within us.  What does the Bible say about mankind? Romans 3:10 says There is none righteous not even one. Romans 3:23 says All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.  Take this to the bankGod wants all mankind to be saved. Romans 10:13 says Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.  God has provided a means for salvationJesus died on the cross to pay for our sins. We must confess our sins and accept Jesus as Lord and Savior. Ephesians 2:8-9 says For it is by grace you have been saved through faithand this is not from yourselves it is the gift of Godnot by works so that no one can boast.  If you accept Jesus God then sends the Holy Spirit to live within your heart. Have you done that? You become a new personyou have the power of the Holy Spirit within you. By the way the Holy Spirit will communicate with your spirit and let you know you are saved. And this is very important to rememberSatan has no authority over those who are in Christ but has domain over unbelievers.  I have made a recent study and believe that less than ten percent of the worlds population including America will go to Heaven. In fact in a recent Barna poll it was found that only six percent of Christians hold to a biblical worldview.  Will there be a revival in America? My answer--I believe not prior to the seven-year Tribulation. During the Tribulation there will be one last huge revival with millions accepting Jesus refer to Revelation 6:9-11 and Revelation 20:4.  As we Christians wait patiently for the Rapture what are we to do today? We must share Christ with others churches must preach the Gospel and we must love one another as John 13:34 states A new command I give you love one another as I have loved you so you must love one another.  Very importantand dont forget--in the end God wins! Satan and all unbelievers will be thrown into the Lake of Fire for eternity.  Lets end by quoting John 3:16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. Is the Holy Spirit speaking to you? Please accept Jesus! Amen.,political,Facebook

President Joe Biden and the Democrats are committed to pushing their multi-trillion dollar boondoggle upon the American people. But this plan doesnt just come with an expensive price tag  it is filled with radical ideas that will weaken our economy and reorder America as we know it.  To be clear this package:  Forces $2.1 trillion in tax increases on American families and job creators  Imposes Green New Deal polices and destroys American Energy Independence  Allows over $10 billion in federal funding to go toward abortions  Weaponizes the IRS by allowing for monitoring and tracking of almost every single bank transaction made  Provides amnesty to millions and millions of illegal immigrants  Leaves rural America behind by failing to allocate any funds for critical programs like broadband the commodity safety net crop insurance and disaster assistance  This radical spending package is nothing more than a Trojan Horse for the Democrats to force their extreme socialist agenda on the American people.  And the American people are already seeing and experiencing the negative consequences of their failed policies  rising prices Open Borders labor shortages.  It is time to bring back the smart commonsense Republican policies that created a prosperous America with economic growth record unemployment and border security.  Americas future is at risk and we must do everything we can to flight these Far-Left Socialist policies that will only set our country back.

I don't do feel good excerpts on MLK Day. It does his legacy no good. Instead I tell the truth. 75% of White America hated him when the government killed him....and yes the government killed him. Why? Because his advocacy was full throated & he put every ounce of himself behind everything he stood for especially in his later years when he realized he was the only one talking peace & got bolder. Not to mention his stances on reparative justice for black people. Peace won't eliminate the wealth gap nor pay us what we're owed.  My message on his day is that we MUST be bold in our advocacy for black liberation & restitution no different than he was.  Advocacy is by its very nature confrontational.  We must confront & speak truth to power.....and know that it won't be easy. If it was we wouldn't be in the place we're in. If everybody who said they're not racist wasn't actually racist we'd have seen repair by now. We know that isn't the case.  Continue to rest in power King.

Dems always boycott and protest and companies give in. Why ? Because conservatives say and do nothing in a similar fashion. We don't make our voices heard to corporate america. This needs to stop . Asking for identification to vote is not jim crow Is not racist and is not a violation of your basic freedom. Believing that an entire group of people are too stupid to be able to get an ID to vote is racist. The irony is rich Especially coming from a party that believes to exercise another constitutional right owning a gun . you not only have to prove who you are but you need an FBI background check to be worthy of it.,political,Facebook
"To all : President Trump was a great American patriot and leader. His presidency was everything but dictatorial. His leadership was compassionate and smart and good for the country despite all the fake propaganda and demonization by the democrats and the fake news media. He governed with love of country and an America First ideology and not of party and partisanship and corruption. He placed the interests of the American people first and foremost. He was smart in dealing with foreign powers friends and foes included and brought respect and dignity to America. He brought back jobs that had been lost forever and created the greatest economy in the history of the country with record employment and growth for all including every minority group. He did this despite the greatest slander misinformation collusion and multiple coup attempts against his Presidency and his character and his administration. He did this despite one of the worst pandemics in modern history and constant barrage of attacks by the democrats and their allies in the fake MSM and despite two hoaxes of an impeachment and Russian collusion hoax.He created a vaccine in record time when everyone of his opponents made fun of him and ridiculed him. operation ""warp speed"" has saved tens of thousands of lives  if not millions in this country and the world. He was falsely called a racist antisemite Hitlerian dictatorial and many other derogatory names all as part of the attempt to cheat him out of a second term which he won by a landslide and millions of more votes than the votes of his first term election.History is not subject to the manipulations and machinations of the corrupt few and time will be the ultimate rightful judge of this man and his love for his country and people. The swamp and the deep state won but the majority of The American people know the truth and will not allow it to continue to rule for long. Many have been fooled and misled but the awakening is here and The People will take over their country from the greedy and the corrupt and powerful. God has always watched over America and its people because despite all its flaws and all its shortcomings it is the most democratic country in the history of mankind and a force for good and benevolence. It is no wonder everyone is trying to come here from all over the globe and whether they come legally or unlawfully they never want to leave.

This is an attack on your personal liberties and for the past 18 months you have seen them under attack by the Gov punishing those that disagree with her radical agenda.

"A day Early:  My 9/11 view -  I am an American - a Patriotic Flag Loving Gun Owning Law Abiding stand-up and fight your ass kind of citizen.  In the morning I am likely to cry. I'll probably shed that tear while driving in a truck this Saturday morning just as I did 20 years ago and every year since.  The heroes are the ""First Responders"" that all too often go under appreciated or unnoticed in the daily lives of many Americans. These are the firefighters EMTs and Law Enforcement Officers that run AT the trouble. Those that run into harms way when others are running away. Those that stand-up rise-up bow-up and hold-up under the most immense amounts of pressure - when it matters the most.  Without our First Responders the World would be pure chaos and thats on a good day. Im proud to be somehow lucky enough to be associated with the fine humans in law enforcement.  We certainly lost thousands of Americans in the attacks of 9/11/01. We lost many more in the battles that have been fought in distant lands...each hero paying the price of freedom with a life - a life that was special to each of their loved ones in ways most of us will never understand.

PROTECTING AMERICA AND ITS WORKERS  [With] the recent discoveries of physicians and neurologists engineers and economists the public can formulate minimum occupational standards below which demonstrably work can be prosecuted only at a human deficit. [We] hold that all industrial conditions which fall below such standards should come within the scope of governmental action and controlled in the same way that subnormal sanitary conditions are subject to public regulation and for the same reason - because they threaten the general welfare.  Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Nomination Acceptance Speech at Progressive Party Convention August 6 1912  Hospitals at crisis care levels. Children increasingly infected and hospitalized by the new Delta COVID-19 variant. States forcing businesses to assume the risk of employee and customer infections due to masking prohibitions.  President Bidens vaccination plan attempts to address these new threats from the coronavirus pandemic. Americans are understandably weary of all of the restrictions and frustrated by the failure of our federal and state governments to develop a clear path out of them. The way to examine the necessity of the plan is to ask three questions:  1. Is it a good idea? 2. Is it legal? 3. Is there a better way to do it?  Is it a good idea?  As I said in my post Wasting Americas Moment the vaccination program is an effective and uniquely American response to the pandemic. Vaccinations significantly reduce the likelihood of hospitalization and eliminate the risk of death not only for recipients but also potentially for the unvaccinated. They are also our best way to achieve a return to normality in life by allowing business and government to reopen by lessening their liability for workers compensation and customer liability. The toll on our children should also concern us and supports a masking mandate in at least elementary schools.  Is it legal?  The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1974 grants the Federal government the power to regulate workplace safety to reduce workplace hazards including illnesses. This law has existed for over three decades and its legality has repeatedly been upheld. In particular section 6 (c)(1) gives the President through the Department of Labor Occupational Safety the right to issue Emergency Temporary Standards (ETS) when employees are exposed to grave danger from exposure to substances or agents determined to be toxic or physically harmful or from new hazards and (B) that such emergency standard is necessary to protect employees from such danger. 29 U.S.C.  655(c)(1). This cannot be done by mere executive order. The proposed ETS must be reviewed by an advisory committee drafted and then published in the Federal Register. While it becomes immediately effective at upon publication it expires after six months if not renewed through the usual notice and comment procedure under the federal Administrative Procedure Act. See this description of the process on OSHAs website  Thus it will be at least a week before any rule or mandate is adopted. Based on the statement from the White House the rule will allow employees to escape the vaccination requirements through weekly negative COVID-19 testing. Many other issues will need to be addressed and the President has met with business and labor leaders to begin to resolve them. They will also be hashed out by the advisory committee.  Is there a better way do it?  The new emergency standard is unique since it will apply not just to certain industries but to to almost every type of workplace in the nation. Imposing a mandate of this breadth should be the province of the Congress not an administrative agency. Acting through legislation instead of an OSHA rulemakings would have allowed the administration to include measures that are outside of the agencys power such as providing federal financial support for the small number of employees who may suffer adverse reactions to the vaccine. Even more importantly it would have forced Republicans and Democrats in Congress to confront the issues both specious and valid about our pandemic response. Such a debate would have exposed the weaknesses in both the anti-vaxxer and permanent lockdown camps which may be why both sides want to avoid it. However The eventual result would not fully satisfy the Dr. Anthony Faucis or Rep. Marjorie Greens of the world but it might satisfy the average American trying to run his or her life in a responsible and caring manner.  Nevertheless we appear to be stuck with the OSHA emergency standard as the only likely method of spurring vaccinations and stopping the surge in the current Delta variant of COVID-19. If opponents want to be helpful they will start demanding that the Biden Administration set a clear metric for when vaccination and masking mandates will end. What number they pick - whether it is cases hospitalization rates or death rates - matters less than the simple courageous act of making a decision and setting a goal for the American people to rally around. Only then will we move beyond irresponsible political rhetoric and see the light at the end of this dark tunnel.  Please visit the website version of this post to see the referenced links.

South Carolina Federation of Republican Men Stance on PROTECTION of ELECTION INTEGRITY in the UNITED STATES of AMERICA.  The U.S. election system is highly decentralized. Public agencies and administrators have critical roles to play in ensuring fair and safe elections. In most cases the nations counties are responsible for actually running our elections. Decentralization and lack of standardization create a number of challenges but this structure can be a strength from a security perspective. The right to vote in a free and fair election is the most basic civil right one on which many of the other rights the citizens of the United States of America demand.  Petition to the United States Congress: Secure elections are the cornerstone of a thriving republic. To ensure the protection of the election process in national state and local elections. A key priority of every state Attorney General is to investigate and prosecute the increasing allegations of voter fraud to ensure election integrity within the United States.  Require voter ID: A voter should be required to validate his or her identity with government-issued photo ID to vote in person or by absentee ballot (as states such as Alabama and Kansas require). Government-issued IDs should be free for those who cannot afford one.  Verify citizenship of voters: Only lawful citizens can vote in federal elections. States should therefore require proof of citizenship to register to vote as well as verify the citizenship of registered voters with the records of the Department of Homeland Security including access to the E-Verify system.  States should not permit same-day registration automatic voter registration and private funding of election officials and government agencies: Registration should be required before Election Day to give election officials sufficient time to verify the accuracy of the registration information contained on a registration form and to confirm the eligibility of the potential voter. . . All individuals should be asked at the time of the state agency transaction such as the application for a drivers license whether they want to register to vote.  Provide state legislatures with legal standing: State legislatures must ensure that they have legal standingeither through a specific state law or through a constitutional amendment if that is requiredto sue other state officials such as governors or secretaries of state who make or attempt to make unauthorized changes in state election laws.  For example if a secretary of state extends the deadline set by state law for the receipt of absentee ballots legislatures should have legal standing to contest that unilateral change that overrides state law. They should be classified as a necessary party in any lawsuit. And voters should be provided by state law with the ability to file a writ of mandamus against any state or local official who fails to abide by or enforce a state election-law requirement. To avoid premature release of election results the counting of ballots including absentee and early votes should not begin until the polls close on Election Day. However if a state insists on beginning the count before Election Day it should ban the release of results until the evening of Election Day subject to criminal penalties.  Provide voting assistance: Any individuals providing assistance to a voter in a voting booth because the voter is illiterate disabled or otherwise requires assistance should be required to complete a form to be filed with poll election officials providing their name address contact information and the reason they are providing assistance. They should also be required to provide a photo ID.  Allow election observers complete access to the election process: Political parties candidates and third-party organizations should all be allowed to have observers in every aspect of the election process because transparency is essential to a fair and secure system. The only limitation on such observers is that they cannot interfere with the voting and counting process. However a representative of the election office should be present to answer the questions of the observers. They should be legally allowed to be in a positionexactly like election officials to observe everything going on other than the actual voting by individuals. Election officials should be prohibited from stationing observers so far away that they cannot observe the process including such procedures as the opening of absentee ballots and the verification process.  Prevent vote trafficking: Vote trafficking (also called vote harvesting) by third parties should be banned. That would ensure that candidates campaign staffers party activists and political consultants are prohibited from picking up and potentially mishandling or changing absentee ballots and pressuring or coercing vulnerable voters in their homes. In other words a political group cant offer to pick up ballots and then bring them to the polling place and/or mail them with no third party supervising that groups behavior in the interim.  Limit absentee ballots: Absentee ballots should be reserved for those individuals who are too disabled to vote in person or who will be out of town on Election Day and on all early-voting days.  Verify the accuracy of voter registration lists: Computerized statewide voter-registration lists should be designed to be interoperable so that they can communicate seamlessly with other state record databases to allow frequent exchanges and comparisons of information.,political,Facebook

Bitcoin and Gold promote freedom  Promoting Freedom  Stated this is the sole opinion of this author that individuals should consider investing in Bitcoin Gold and Silver as a road to self sovereignty and freedom. The world has changed a great deal in the past 14 months. Money printing by governments to fund projects and keep corporations solvent is a worldwide phenomenon that shows no sign of stopping. This means that the value of fiat currency i.e. the U.S. Dollar the Euro the Japanese Yen and the Chinese Renminbi face the possibility of heavy devaluations. If governments and central banks were smart they should invest more heavily in Gold and allocate funds for Bitcoin as hard money assets. Sure Bitcoin is a speculative asset but it is fast becoming the digital age version of gold that will exist simultaneously alongside Central Bank Digital Currencies in the coming years just as fiat currency now exists alongside gold. Precious metals will always be a store of value and in the opinion of the newly established Party of the United States Gold and Silver can never be replaced by Bitcoin or any other currency. They are all compliments one to the other. Freedom has always been the emblem of America. We must struggle to keep this priceless value both in terms of individual rights and what our government must stand for and uphold. Self sovereignty should be the goal of the individual and the value expressed and lived by our government. Excess spending and living beyond our means as an individual a family and our government must cease. It is the only way we will be able to move forward into a brighter and more secure future. Savings can create investments and sound investments can create businesses greater entrepreneurialism and productive manufacturing. The old motto of spending less than you make saving and investing what you can is and always will be the soundest advice.  Gaining knowledge about Bitcoin #MaxKeiser and Gold #Alasdairmacleod and the current state of banking #SimonDixon are to many people essential elements in today's unpredictable world.,political,Facebook
Its been too long since Ive posted to my page but God has really put something on my heart that I feel I must share with as many people as I can. I want to share my views on the App Snap Chat for parents. Its a very dangerous app that exposes our children to filth. Filthy speech filthy images human trafficking fornicstion drugs & every facet of sin. It amazes me that our society has become so morally corrupt that it does not recognize the pure destruction of allowing under age children access & the promotion of such platforms that are destroying the very fabrics of families not only in the United States of America but all across the world. There should be age limits set for access to these dangerous Apps that promote the exploration of young girls & boys across the globe. Giving human traffickers access to locations & information to groom their next victims. I have to be honest & transparent in my writings. Since starting this page Be Gods light my life in several different areas has been under attack. I have been affected in health in my family & children. The devil knows his time is short here on earth & what I have recently lost sight of is that a great victory is near when the devil attacks you the most. My dream & my hope is to help people around the world to touch lives with my stories or writings which I always base off my own experiences. I recently had a member of my family affected by Snap Chat & have spoken to members of my community whos daughters were groomed then trafficked. The news media does not cover this subject enough. It is the duty of the Christians the people of God to stand up & protect our children. The Bible clearly states in his word that it would be better for a person to tie a stone around his neck & be cast into the ocean than to cause one of his little ones his children to stumble. We are in a battle for our families our marriages & especially our children. The devil starts with the head the father the man he is like a wrecking ball. In my home Im the stronger spiritual leader not by choice but by faith. I continue to pray & be joined in prayer that this will not always be the case. The more I speak out against these platforms the more I notice members of my own household attacked or affected by an invisible enemy. Satan is the father of lies & deceit he is the great accuser. In this day & age people can stand on platforms or be just like Satan and accuse people of wickedness because of their own wickedness & great sin or falling away. I got great advice recently from a great man of god who told me that I must love people where they are. Is this not hard for all of us when we feel we are under attack? It is truly a battle. I want the parental figures of the world to not be blind not be complacent or nieve like I recently was to the great lengths our young people go to to fit in or follow the status quo because something sinful has captivated millions even the multitudes of adults that might be reading my posts. Thats not really the point though is it. The point is we are living in the days of Noah except at an accelerated rate fueled by technology which has only helped fuel the industries like the porn industry which often times uses sex trafficking victims sometimes very young pre pubescent teens dressing them up at adult women for grown men to solicit and fornicate to. We should all be outraged that this is going on but instead we are conforming to ideals in government or in pure immorality that are only fanning the fires of sin. Those of us that stand firm in our protection of children & in the lives of children the Christians who stand for scripture & not new age non sense teaching but those of us who cling to scripture the way Jesus cling to the cross. I saw a post earlier that I shared & it had a profound affect on me. It said we are all basically going to hell but are we going to choose to get on the life boat because the ship is sinking & Jesus already paid for your sin do get on the boat read your Bible protect your children & dont buy into the fact like I did that your children are entitled to have cell phones entitled to participate in Apps etc without educating yourself or caring enough to know exactly who your childrens friends are! These social media platforms they allow children to communicate in secret code like cockroaches & kids are smart enough to have one very visible page for the viewing of parents while completely concealing a separate account from their parents or legal guardian. I pray that my post is shared & shared so that the people of faith can start a movement to disarm the platforms that are ruining the lives of our children the most precious things in the heart of our father in Heaven & his son king Jesus. Stay in scripture and remember if the enemy is wrecking havoc on your family or even your children because your own personal faith has become so great you are now a triple threat to the enemys plan & the only way he can get you is through those around you then stay in the word day & night. Memorize scripture fast & pray. Pray over your children but be watchful that the enemy is coming to kill & destroy our Christian homes & the best way to fight the battle is with his word. Please watch your children do not be trusting of their young minds being able to discern evil from good. Keep them close & guard them with your lives. God Bless all of you.,political,Facebook
Russian SVR Espionage / Nasdaq Stock - Net Element NETE Securities & Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler Chairman 100 F Street NE Washington DC 20549  Federal Bureau of Investigation Christopher Wray 935 Pennsylvania Ave NW Washington DC 20535  There is a current ongoing Russian threat to American national security that has burrowed into the very heart of our economic system. Americans need to know that the Russian foreign intelligence service SVR (the spy agency and successor to the KBG) is penetrating and jeopardizing our economic system through a Nasdaq shell company called Net Element.  Tactical Rabbit a Pennsylvania-based private intelligence agency uncovered this through our network of former CIA FBI Secret Service and military intelligence specialists who operate worldwide. Tactical Rabbit has launched HUMINT (interpersonal human intelligence) operations against specific SVR-related targets. Our findings revealed that Vladimir Putin is directly involved in Net Element. CEO Oleg Firer an ambassador to Grenada was directly given his diplomatic cover by Putin himself. Net Element was launched with the mission to spy on Americans and to penetrate the U.S. economic system.  Putin believed it was critical for a diplomat to head Net Element to provide a high level of cover and immunity from U.S. Law Enforcement agencies. Firer also has direct connections to at least three groups of Russian organized crime as well as the Russian SVR. Russian intelligence controls him and he is their asset.  I Everett Stern founder of Tactical Rabbit filed a SEC whistleblower claim against Net Element and the SEC has responded in kind. I am drafting this public letter to ensure the SEC follows through on eliminating a deadly threat from our economic system.  It is our hope that the FBI raids the Miami headquarters of Net Element and takes any Russian operatives into custody. I provided a full intelligence report conducted by Tactical Rabbit to the FBI CIA SEC and the Treasury Department.  Both the Russian GRU and SVR intelligence services plan to use Firer and Net Element as agents of influence within the U.S. -- covertly influencing U.S. public opinion and U.S. policymakers -- and to acquire restricted U.S. technology. They can also provide legitimate commercial cover to Russian intelligence officers operating inside the U.S. to help spot and assess potential U.S. citizens of operational interest and to covertly move and transfer large amounts of money in and out of the U.S. to fund Russian intelligence operations.  Through their association with a high-profile and wealthy Russian businessman Firer and Net Element have developed business ties and associations which have possibly allowed them to clandestinely acquire restricted dual-use (civilian and military) U.S. technology in the battery and electric vehicle sectors for passage to Russia.  All the money Net Element makes keeps going back to Moscow. But whats important is the technology. Its also taking American citizens information and sending it back to Moscow.  Everett A.

"May 19 2021  I just filled out yet another FBI tip my 27th about the discrimination going on in my neighborhood profiling of my police department and violations of my Civil and Constitutional Rights. All because of a security camera?! YOU BET! When people don't listen they miss the most important part of a conversation because they don't look at something with an open mind. They miss the most important parts. The police's unwillingness to move away from their projection means I have to live as a second class citizen. That is not legal and it is not right.  My Fraternity brothers last Fall came into the picture to help with things going on in the neighborhood and my life. For whatever reason that support has turned to silence and unwillingness to do the one simple thing I requested: help with getting neighbors to stop their discrimination. I don't even need them to do the work but instead just establish contact with the FBI and have them finally contact me about things that have been going on. It appears that all of them have abandoned me too all because of an assumption that everything going on is related to using drugs. So my Brothers the police my friends my family and the FBI won't help in resolving real conflicts because the police and Sherriff's department has discriminated against me because of lies nd false narratives of mental evaluation forms and CREATED something that wasn't there to begin with.  I feel so alone in the world with people misinterpreting things and not coming to my assistance. I've never experienced such isolation in my entire life. It's horrible too to know that if I ever really needed the police's help that I would already be profiled before the officers arrived and they would not listen but instead ask ""Are you on your medication?"" Being taped and recorded 24/7 every day is a huge crime and that is something everyone is ignoring. It's gross illegal and violates numerous Constitutional Rights at the same time. I have no idea how long it's going to take for SOMEONE to come to my rescue but while I wait each day thast passes is another day that my rights are being violated and I live as a 2nd class citizen in a country where all citizens are guaranteed certain rights. I have a new pledge instead of the one I was taught in school:  I pledge allegiance To a man of invisibility In a state of America For which he stands.  One nation Under God invisible With liberty and justice But not for me.  This new pledge is the reality of my life and it sucks.

Dedication to America  America today we celebrate your 245th birthday; we celebrate your beauty and your significance. From the beaches of Rhode Island to the plains of Texas you radiate beauty. A beauty that can be found in your lands and that can be found in your idea. An idea founded based on liberty and the prospect that all men are created equally. An idea that ignites the soul of its people and that serves as a guiding example for the rest of the world. A vision of a place in which citizens can fulfill dreams. An idea that imagines a place where all these things reign supreme. Two hundred forty-five years ago this idea became a reality brought to life by the courage of those who were willing to fight for it ready and yearning to leave a better future for future generations. Their efforts were not in vain and we are here today celebrating the start of this idea and the actions these brave patriots made to make it a reality. Since then America has served as a guiding beacon of freedom and liberty to the world. Through its values and prospects America is a place that attracts people from all areas even from the most remote regions of the world. It is a place where even the poorest and most disadvantaged people can see their dreams become a reality. Through these 245 years we have seen people's dreams become a reality and as they became real the vision of America only became more real. So today love this place and this idea. Love them as they have loved us continue to believe in this vision and believe in the future of America as it is the only way the American idea will continue to live on.

They both want to be able to put a roof over the heads of their families clothes on their backs food in their bellies and for their children to get an education so that they would grow up and become adults who have life a little easier than how they currently have it. The Wild and Wonderful Whites of West Virginia is a documentary that is featured on Amazon Prime. I recommend viewing of it for those who seek understanding. These folks seem to be descendants of Scott Irish and they racially identify as whites but their lives are far from privileged. They have more in common with Lalees Kin - another documentary on YouTube about a family who identifies as Black in Alabama. This documentary highlights the legacy of cotton on the family.  When a poor white family who is trying to survive on public assistance somewhere in Appalachia or upstate New York hears other people talk about White Privilege they become irate. For them life is a living hell. They hardly can make ends meet. Their children are on opiates attempting to medicate the hardships of their experiences and yet some people have the audacity to say that they have white privilege. What makes it more infuriating for them is when they turn on their only television set and see a parade of Black faces on CNN who are doing far better than them. So in their world Affirmative Action is putting Blacks ahead of them while they are stuck in the Appalachian dirt poor white and unprivileged.  This is the poor Appalachian white individuals reality. How can you convince him that he or she is wrong? You certainly cant win the argument that the Black faces paraded on CNN arent doing better than he or she is and you certainly cannot argue that whiteness has given him or her an advantage in his or her current state. So as a result of his or her reality and the narrative that is pushed he or she becomes angry at the Blacks whom he or she deems are given an unfair advantage.  This poor White Appalachian angry mans or womans eyes are not focused at the top - on the rulers of the country. He or she isnt measuring the booty of the one percent. He or she is only focusing on the scarce resources that is distributed between the 99 percent that are also experiencing pressure from the rulers on top. Its like two employees who apply for a position at work. One employee was given the job. The employee who didnt get the job is angry with the employee who got the job rather than the bosses who gave the job to the other employee. The employee who didnt get the job cant afford to be angry with the bosses because he risks losing the current job he has so he takes his anger out on his competition. This is a dynamic in distribution of scarce resources.  Robert Kennedy Jr. seemed to have understood the dynamics of scarce resources and those of poverty. He was working to unite poor people in Appalachia with poor people from the cotton fields in Alabama but he was deemed a threat by those who dont want to increase the amount of resources to be distributed to the 99 percent. Donald Trump also seems to understand these dynamics and he too was working to increase the resources of the poor Appalachian and the poor Alabaman but race became his Achilles Heel. The people who want to keep the poor people divided since 1676 when the Bacon Rebellion highlighted the threat to them when slaves and indentured servants come together used race once more as they did in 1676 to permanently bridge the gap between the haves and the have nots.  Donald Trump is a better human being than Bill Clinton Barack Obama George W. Bush Joe Biden and the lot of these Presidents put together. His administration treated the opiate afflicted as humans in funding treatment for their rehabilitation. Bill Clinton George W. Bush and the Black Messiah Barack Obama failed in doing the same for those afflicted with the crack cocaine epidemic. On the contrary Joe Biden Bill Clinton and Kamala Harris all sent these crack afflicted individuals to jail and Biden and Clinton rendered them homeless as they were barred from public housing.  Barack Obama pretended to consume water from Flint Michigan that was lead infected as a way of convincing the Black people in Flint that this poisonous water was safe for them to drink. Donald Trump might not be cultured or might not be blessed with Miss Manners social graces but he regarded the poor and the drug afflicted as humans rather than trash. But the poor Black people couldnt see that Donald Trump was working to lift them out of poverty. They became blinded by the rhetoric from race theory. Unfortunately race theory in America has become so ingrained that some poor people will choose starvation rather than give up their racial identities.,political,Facebook
The essence of America that which really unites us is not ethnicity or nationality or religion. It is an idea and what an idea it is  that you can come from humble circumstances and do great things.   Condoleezza Rice  #America ,political,Facebook
"From the Pastor:  Should We Be Critical of Critical Race Theory?  Critical Race Theory (CRT) is a philosophy that says that America is a fundamentally flawed and racist country and that all of her institutions such as law business and education are geared towards oppressing non-white people. CRT is not a Christian theory. It has no roots in the Bible but it is heavily rooted in Marxism and if it ever succeeds it will need to weaken and redefine the family the church schools and just about everything else. CRT is built around division and division is what the devil wants today. For years in America we have had many problems between different colors of people and that is just as wrong today as it ever was but if we were all one color the devil would cause division because of height and weight or body type or maybe eye color. Division is wrong. God wants people to have unity as much as possible. Guilt or innocence according to CRT is dependent upon skin color and not necessarily upon your actions. We all need to take responsibility for our actions and for our successes and for our failures.  When CRT is taught in schools we often see young children being taught to feel responsible for slavery when they had nothing to do with slavery. I am in my 50's and I had nothing to do with it. I look back in my family and I see poor people as well as share croppers there. I remember having only one heater in the house when I was a boy and none of that heat got into my room where I slept on those cold winter nights. I used to watch the chickens walking under the house through the cracks in the floor on Front St. in Warsaw. No one I know could claim a privileged status unless you were talking about having a family that loved you and stayed together.  What we really have here from CRT proponents is a desire to see America as she is torn down and rebuilt into something entirely different. We do NOT need to tear down America. America is the greatest country ever. There has never been a nation better than right here. America did not invent the institution of slavery and contrary to popular opinion America never was a world leader in the African slave trade. America was the first nation to end association with the African Slave Trade and the fourth to end slavery. Most slaves that left Africa went to Brazil and Portugal. Today in 2021 there are over 40 million slaves worldwide. There are more enslaved people today than there were during the almost 400 years of the African Slave Trade. There are slaves in America today. We should really be doing our best to fight against human trafficking in the here and now. By the way America is a world leader in the fight against modern day slavery. We cannot change our history but we can change our future and do great things to eliminate the slavery that is happening now.  CRT classifies people as either oppressed or as oppressors. CRT is divisive and is an unbiblical ideology. We can do so much better than CRT. We can please God by loving and respecting one another. I received a blood transfusion about six years ago and I do not wonder who donated the blood that was given to me. I just appreciate that blood and their kindness. Acts 17:26 says ""[God] hath made of one blood all nations of men..."" The problem with prejudice and racism is not skin but sin. We need unity and not the division the CRT brings. CRT is divisive with no unity at all. We are all from One Blood. There is only one race and that is the human race. Yes we should be very critical of Critical Race Theory!",political,Facebook

Excerpt - Screwed Blued Tattooed and Sold Down the River (available at Amazon):  Please Pass the Hacksaw  Americas trek from self-governance to governmental servitude has been relatively nonviolent. Here in America we have trusted our elected officials to represent our best interests trusted our textbooks and teachers to educate us and trusted our so-called free press to alert usbut hey they attended the same schools we did and then some. More and more Americans are overcoming their education via the increased ease of communicationwith a computer we now have each other and the world just a click away.  Bill Hicks (19611994) American stand-up comedian social critic satirist and musician quoted in Wake Up Call (YouTube: ):  It may seem like the odds are stacked against us but this is mere illusion. Great efforts have been made to suppress us and to stifle our true power and potential in order to control us. Weve been conditioned into a state of potential apathy distraction fear and ignorance. Weve been dumbed down brainwashed and misled. There has been an ongoing assault on our perception of reality on our boundaries of possibility and on our collective sense of self. Most importantly though we have been divided. The opposition of the many by the few has only been possible because weve been manipulated into fighting amongst each other over trivial differences such as race gender age and religion to divert us from the fact that were all in the same boata boat which is rapidly sinking and will continue to at an ever increasing rate until we abandon our petty differences and perceptions of each other realize that we all have the same enemy and start working together to take back responsibility and control of our own lives.  Realize that the climate of paranoia and fear perpetuated by the mainstream media which turns us against each other paints every single person a potential criminal pedophile or terrorist and makes us too scared to leave our own houses is illusionary and serves only one purposeto terrify us into docility and division. A nation of terrified and divided citizens is a manipulators wet dream. Stop giving your mind away to the mainstream media. Stop giving away your responsibility away to the government. Unfortunately the highest levels of government as well as most other institutions such as banking and mainstream educationare overrun by corruption and deception and are a large part of the reason were in this mess in the first place.  Fortunately millions are now beginning to wake up. We need to start coming together and doing everything in our power as a collective to raise awareness on these issues. The methods and structure of manipulation can only be effective when the majority of people are kept in ignorance of them. Change that and the entire system of deception and control will collapse.  We can all do somethingmake leaflets websites and YouTube videos write articles form or join activist organizations arrange public documentary viewings give lectures or even just go out of your way to talk about these issues to friends family and complete strangers. At first many will not want to listen but as things get worse and the methods of control become increasingly more blatant and desperate it will prove harder to ignore what is happening and denial would cease to be an option.  This system that seeks to enslave us is held together by the cooperation of ordinary people. As soon as we refuse to cooperate with our own enslavementin a large scale nonviolent way it will collapse like a house of cards. It is essential that we come together as one and stop allowing the few to dictate the lives of the many. Individually we can be picked off one by one but en-masse we are extremely powerful and our manipulators know that.,political,Facebook

There is no time quite like election season in America. For a short period everyone becomes an expert on something in local government. And like a fast-moving summer storm campaign signs suddenly pop up all over town in the most desirable of spaces. Our mailboxes burst with glossy mailers from political hopefuls covered in the best bullet points Grammarly can manage.  We post reams of comments online about issues and expect our friends and neighbors to catch the passion.  We chew over our differences online and in the grocery stores.  We silently wonder how reasonably intelligent people can be so dumb by supporting this candidate or the other.  We publicly endorse our candidates as the smartest people who are dumb enough to run for office.  We open our wallets and donate money to help these people get out the most important messages of all time.  We make new friends and sit in cottage meetings in homes across our town.  We end up talking freely for hours about the things that really matter to us.  We have about all we can stand by election day and vote!  And just as suddenly as it came on the season ends.  The town puts aside most of its differences and the passion for the issues that nearly drove us all insane fades away into a happy forgetfulness.  The signs find their final resetting place somewhat fittingly as the target backstops at the local gun ranges. And the brochures all hit the recycling bin. All done and dusted for another two years.  In the end names on the city hall dais change but the slow and steady work of a democratically elected government continues on as it has for two hundred and forty-three years.

"I read this letter every now and then. It reminds how much we owe to those that fight and protect us- It's a bit long but an excellent read.  This letter was written by Charles Grennel and his comrades who are veterans of the Global War on Terror. Grennel is an Army Reservist who spent two years in Iraq and was a principal in putting together the first Iraqi elections January of 2005. It was written to (left students name out on purpose) who is one of the students at the University of Washington who did not want to honor Medal of Honor winner USMC Colonel Greg Boyington because she does not think those who serve in the U.S. Armed services are good role models.  To: Addressee (student UW)  Subject: Sheep Wolves and Sheepdogs  Dear Miss xxxxxxxx  I read of your student activity regarding the proposed memorial to Col Greg Boyington USMC a Medal of Honor winner. I suspect you will receive a bellyful of angry e-mails from conservative folks like me. You may be too young to appreciate fully the sacrifices of generations of servicemen and servicewomen on whose shoulders you and your fellow students stand. I forgive you for the untutored ways of youth and your naivet. It may be that you are simply a sheep. There's no dishonor in being a sheep--as long as you know and accept what you are.  William J. Bennett in a lecture to the United States Naval Academy November 24 1997 said ""Most of the people in our society are sheep. They are kind gentle productive creatures who can only hurt one another by accident.""  We may well be in the most violent times in history but violence is still remarkably rare. This is because most citizens are kind decent people who are not capable of hurting each other except by accident or under extreme provocation. They are sheep. Then there are the wolves and the wolves feed on the sheep without mercy. Do you believe there are wolves out there that will feed on the flock without mercy? You better believe it. There are evil men in this world and they are capable of evil deeds. The moment you forget that or pretend it is not so you become a sheep. There is no safety in denial.  Then there are sheepdogs and I'm a sheepdog. I live to protect the flock and confront the wolf. If you have no capacity for violence then you are a healthy productive citizen--a sheep. If you have a capacity for violence and no empathy for your fellow citizens then you have defined an aggressive sociopath--a wolf. But what if you have a capacity for violence and a deep love for your fellow citizens? What do you have then? A sheepdog a warrior someone who is walking the uncharted path. Someone who can walk into the heart of darkness into the universal human phobia and walk out unscathed.  We know that the sheep live in denial--that is what makes them sheep. They do not want to believe that there is evil in the world. They can accept the fact that fires can happen which is why they want fire extinguishers fire sprinklers fire alarms and fire exits throughout their kids' schools. But many of them are outraged at the idea of putting an armed police officer in their kids school. Our children are thousands of times more likely to be killed or seriously injured by school violence than fire but the sheep's only response to the possibility of violence is denial. The idea of someone coming to kill or harm their child is just too hard and so they choose the path of denial.  The sheep generally do not like the sheepdog. He looks a lot like the wolf. He has fangs and the capacity for violence. The difference though is that the sheepdog must not cannot and will not ever harm the sheep. Any sheep dog that intentionally harms the lowliest little lamb will be punished and removed. The world cannot work any other way at least not in a representative democracy or a republic such as ours. Still the sheepdog disturbs the sheep. He is a constant reminder that there are wolves in the land. They would prefer that he didn't tell them where to go or give them traffic tickets or stand at the ready in our airports in camouflage fatigues holding an M-16. The sheep would much rather have the sheepdog cash in his fangs spray paint himself white and go ""baa""--until the wolf shows up. Then the entire flock tries desperately to hide behind one lonely sheepdog.  The students the victims at Columbine High School were big tough high school students and under ordinary circumstances they would not have had the time of day for a police officer. They were not bad kids; they just had nothing to say to a cop. When the school was under attack however and SWAT teams were clearing the rooms and hallways the officers had to physically peel those clinging sobbing kids off of them. This is how the little lambs feel about their sheepdog when the wolf is at the door.  Look at what happened after September 11 2001 when the wolf pounded hard on the door. Remember how America more than ever before felt differently about their law enforcement officers and military personnel? Understand that there is nothing morally superior about being a sheepdog; it is just what you choose to be. Also understand that a sheepdog is a funny critter: He is always sniffing around out on the perimeter checking the breeze barking at things that go bump in the night and yearning for a righteous battle. That is the young sheepdogs yearn for a righteous battle. The old sheepdogs are a little older and wiser but they move to the sound of the guns when needed right along with the young ones.  Here is how the sheep and the sheepdog think differently. The sheep pretend the wolf will never come but the sheepdog lives for that day. After the attacks on September 11 2001 most of the sheep that is most citizens in America said ""Thank God I wasn't on one of those planes."" The sheepdogs the warriors said ""Dear God I wish I could have been on one of those planes. Maybe I could have made a difference."" You want to be able to make a difference. There is nothing morally superior about the sheepdog the warrior but he does have one real advantage. Only one. And that is that he is able to survive and thrive in an environment that destroys 98 percent of the population.  There was research conducted a few years ago with individuals convicted of violent crimes. These cons were in prison for serious predatory crimes of violence: assaults murders and killing law enforcement officers. The vast majority said that they specifically targeted victims by body language: Slumped walk passive behavior and lack of awareness. They chose their victims like big cats do in Africa when they select one out of the herd that is least able to protect itself. Some people may be destined to be sheep and others might be genetically primed to be wolves or sheepdogs. But I believe that most people can choose which one they want to be and I'm proud to say that more and more Americans are choosing to become sheepdogs.  Seven months after the attack on September 11 2001 Todd Beamer was honored in his hometown of Cranbury New Jersey. Todd as you recall was the man on Flight 93 over Pennsylvania who called on his cell phone to alert an operator from United Airlines about the hijacking. When they learned of the other three passenger planes that had been used as weapons Todd and the other passengers confronted the terrorist hijackers. In one hour a transformation occurred among the passengers--athletes business people and parents--from sheep to sheepdogs and together they fought the wolves ultimately saving an unknown number of lives on the ground.  ""There is no safety for honest men except by believing all possible evil of evil men."" - Edmund Burke.  Here is the point I would like to emphasize especially to the thousands of police officers and soldiers I speak to each year. In nature the sheep real sheep are born as sheep. Sheepdogs are born that way and so are wolves. They didn't have a choice. But you are not a critter. As a human being you can be whatever you want to be. It is a conscious moral decision. If you want to be a sheep then you can be a sheep and that is okay but you must understand the price you pay. When the wolf comes you and your loved ones are going to die if there is not a sheepdog there to protect you. If you want to be a wolf you can be one but the sheepdogs are going to hunt you down and you will never have rest safety trust or love. But if you want to be a sheepdog and walk the warrior's path then you must make a conscious and moral decision every day to dedicate equip and prepare yourself to thrive in that toxic corrosive moment when the wolf comes knocking at the door.  This business of being a sheep or a sheep dog is not a yes-no dichotomy. It is not an all-or-nothing either-or choice. It is a matter of degrees a continuum. On one end is an abject head-in-the-sand-sheep and on the other end is the ultimate warrior. Few people exist completely on one end or the other. Most of us live somewhere in between. Immediately after 9-11 almost everyone in America took a step up that continuum away from denial. The sheep took a few steps toward accepting and appreciating their warriors and the warriors started taking their job more seriously. Now the sheep have again begun to despise the sheepdogs as those who represent unending violence and deny the real dangers of the wolves.  Its OK to be a sheep but do not kick the sheep dog. Indeed the sheep dog may just run a little harder strive to protect a little better and be fully prepared to pay an ultimate price in battle and spirit with the sheep moving from ""Baa"" to ""thanks"". We do not call for gifts or freedoms beyond our lot. We just need a small pat on the head a smile and a thank you to fill the emotional tank that is drained protecting the sheep. And when our number is called by ""The Almighty"" and day retreats into night a small prayer before the heavens just may be in order to say thanks for letting you continue to be a sheep. And be grateful for the thousandsmillions--of American sheepdogs who permit you the freedom to express even bad ideas.  Sincerely Charles Grennel --",political,Facebook

I was appalled to see the catastrophe in Texas during the snow storm that claimed the lives of many Texans. I grew up in the North West Texas Panhandle an area that is able to absorb this type of weather and even folks in my hometown felt the impact of this storm. Let me get down to the nitty gritty.  We were told that:  - Global warming has no impact on climate change and that it is all just a hoax - Texas is capable of seceding from the Union even with our inability to have a structured power grid - COVID-19 was going to mysteriously disappear and that the practice of social distancing wasnt enough to contain a virus of pandemic proportions - That immigration has no place in America - Police reform isnt necessary and racial injustice does not exist in America today - Income inequality is not an issue in corporate America  The truth of the matter is that WE WERE TOLD LIES and Texans have suffered enough for it economically through their finances physically with their health and now morally in their belief that this is it for us. Texas deserves better. That is why I have decided to run for the US Senate to represent Texas. I will be frank with you. I wont have billionaires donating to my campaign and I will tell you why. There will be no tit for tat in this campaign meaning that there will be no favors involved for someone who gives me a large portion of money. This is why I am depending on grass roots donations from people like me and you. People who were left out in the cold to fend for ourselves while our leaders took trips to Cancun and/or were protected by their own greed and lust for power wherever it is that they were hiding out. I will tell you where they werent. They werent in Texas providing us guidance or resources to help our people out. Join me in the fight to restore decency in Texas. And we together will take that fight to Washington and restore decency in America. I will not lie to you the challenge will be great but I as a proud Texan do not believe that our lively hood has been entrusted into the hands of the right people. And so with that I do it for you for me for us for the senior citizens of our state who could not have withstood a chance in these recent events. All of us for Texas Todos por Tejas. Vamos!  I have teamed up with Act Blue to handle my campaign contributions as I am running on the Democratic Platform.

"The American Dream. It is different for every person I know but I wish for everyone the opportunity at their slice of the American Dream.  In today's world I think there is confusion on what the American Dream is. It is not waiting for the government to provide the opportunity the money or the special lane so a citizen can move ahead of another in their reach for their dream. It is not gotten by waiting but by working harder than you think is possible every day until you achieve it.  I mention this today as a result of purchasing a UTV yesterday. I drove to Ardmore on Friday to look at a Yamaha Rhino and was truly impressed by the gentleman that was selling the machine Sonny. Of course I am often impressed by those that work hard and truly get at least a slice of their American Dream.  To my surprise Sonny agreed to make some major changes to the vehicle and have it delivered to me in Norman yesterday before he received a penny from me. He trusted me. And I trusted him to follow thru. In addition he gave me the opportunity for a full refund until this coming Sunday. I trust if not satisfied on this 15 year old used UTV he would follow thru on his promise. (just FYI he had no idea I was a Senator)  Sonny is a first generation Asian American from Vietnam. Yesterday he shared some of his story with me. It is not an unusual story for those that keep their eye on the prize the American Dream. Sonny said without hesitation that America is the greatest nation on earth and the opportunities here are unlike anywhere on earth. He came here 36 years ago with no money and unable to speak a word of English. He struggled to get out of high school for several years he was a ""seat warmer"" as they called him. He then failed to finish college as the language barrier was just too great. Undeterred he joined the Navy with plans of going to officer training. Finally with six months left to go he was offered a chance to go to officer training school. Surprising to me he turned this down as he was beginning to see the opportunities of achieving his dreams in the private sector.  Today Sonny has three children in college at least a couple homes as he buys some for his children attending college and is a small business owner. Has he ever been discriminated against? ""yes probably"". But his focus was always on achieving here what he can never achieve anywhere else. Liberty and freedom and hard work is what brought him the American Dream. Naturally he is very concerned for the next generation as they sometimes are preoccupied on perceived road blocks and are being trapped by politicians that claim they are trying to help when clearly they are just trying to use.  I would encourage all Americans to follow Sonny's lead. I think very few had/have the obstacles he had but if all had the attitude he had and has and the willingness to work hard there is no question that all would get at least a decent slice of their American Dream. God Bless and reach for your dream.",political,Facebook
AFGHANISTAN WHAT EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD KNOW  Today was a tough day. A sad day. A day that should have and could have been prevented. Today was the greatest single loss of life our American military has suffered in ten years. In fact this whole fiasco or my better stated this catastrophe could have been prevented. To provide you a better understanding of the current situation and how/why we are where we are please allow me to provide some background and much needed truth and even better truth in context.  Over the last few days I have directly and personally spoken with and heard from former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo former DNI John Ratcliffe and the current Secretaries of Defense State Homeland Security Director of National Intelligence and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. The following is the best and most honest account and assessment I can provide to my constituents and the American People without divulging any specific classified information.  PRESIDENT TRUMPS PLAN FOR WITHDRAWAL  On Feb 29 2020 Pres Trump announced he had reached an agreement to withdraw American forces from Afghanistan by May 2021. This deal was a conditions based withdrawal and if certain conditions werent being met the US reserved the right to delay or tear up the deal. These conditions?  The Taliban would agree to  cut all ties with Al-Queda enter into a peaceful power sharing agreement with the Afghani Govt led by Pres Ghani Honor all checkpoints manned by Afghan troops Not to attack or destabilize provincial capitals protect the rights of women & minorities not attack US Troops  Now as you may have guessed the Taliban didnt always live up to their side of the bargain. They probed. They violated. On numerous occasions. And somewhat of a cycle would play out.  1. Taliban violates agreement 2. US hits back hard with Afghan ground forces with strong US air cover. 3. Taliban retreats 4. Americans reach out via back channels 5. Taliban properly disciplined agrees not to repeat  And these (mostly) minor violations would continue with the same result. You see they were probing and testing our resolve. They wanted to see what they could get away with. If they were met with strength? Theyd back off. But If they were met with weakness then you can guess how they would have responded. Well you dont have to guess because in 2021 they met with mush and as we witnessed they grew increasingly emboldened and aggressive.  At this point we need to be fair and absolutely clear. Had President Trump served another term none of us know exactly how this withdrawal would have played out. We dont. And we never will. For sure anyway. But there are some pretty strong clues that point to a very different outcome.  First Pres Trump listened intently to his advisors on this issue and adjusted his own perception and plans accordingly. He was deeply committed to getting all Americans out and if necessary our proven Afghan allies. He was also just as committed to ensuring that the Taliban if they came to power would get nothing nada zilch not one piece of American equipment. I was told repeatedly by folks that were in the room with the President that he wanted and I quote Not even a styrofoam cooler with an American flag on it left behind. He also said more than once Not a single bullet not one. Not a single American bullet is gonna be left.  So how did we get from that to where we are today?  Many in the Biden Administration and some of their media allies are trying to push out the myth that the unraveling of the Afghan Govt and military caught even the intelligence community by surprise. This is an utter and provable lie. When Pres Trump would meet with his intel team he would ask every time if conditions are not met and honored how long do you all think the Afghanis will last? EVERY voice shared the same assessment. Most likely a few weeks. At best a month or two. The President himself often would share that he didnt think theyd last two days. Without agreed upon conditions being a reality a clear disaster awaited.  And theres some strong evidence that points to the fact that this would almost assuredly played out differently under a Trump Administration. From the day the agreement was reached over the next year and a half not one American was lost to anger in Afghanistan. We drew down from 15000 to 2500 troops and there was enviable stability. Today we have twice as many boots on the ground and we have chaos.  For years in Afghanistan we would root out and kill bad guys and now we are begging for mercy from some of these very same thugs. Now the Taliban have more Blackhawk helicopters than the nation of Australia. Toss a $50 M67 grenade into a $20 million Blackhawk and viola no more high tech weaponry in the hands of the Taliban or Iran or China. The obvious best case scenario for the $85 billion worth of equipment left behind would have been for us to take the valuable stuff out with us. But failing that its inexcusable and quite frankly unforgivable that it wasnt destroyed before falling into enemy hands. There are reports that Blackhawks and other highly sensitive and advanced weaponry is already being couriered to Iran and China. And if true which it almost certainly is wed have to expect that China is going to do everything within their power to reverse engineer our cutting edge technology.  Please allow me to be crystal clear. What we have witnessed in the last two months is not a failure of intelligence in any way it is a failure to accept/acknowledge the intelligence and take appropriate action. The Afghanistan catastrophe and the subsequent loss of life equipment and prestige is a failure of leadership.  Joe Biden moved the original May 1st deadline to August 31st. While I agreed then and still do now that the original deadline needed to be moved Aug 31st was not the right time. It was obvious by the Spring the Taliban were acting in bad faith. Other than laying off our troops they werent honoring the terms of the agreement. They were making moves to simply wait us out and then strike against the Afghan government the moment we left. Under just such a scenario we were really left with two choices. Ramp back up and stay put or leave but leave at the beginning of winter evac all but a skeleton crew of American civilians AND have executable plans in place to withdraw any and all Americans that remained and proven Afghan allies and then destroy all sensitive equipment that couldnt be removed. Unfortunately and tragically no such plans were ever drawn up and the deadline wasnt moved.  In Afghanistan fighting is seasonal. Always has been. The climate is unmerciful and the Afghan winter doesnt lend itself to being all that conducive to combat operations. The fighting season begins in the spring and ends in the late fall. In the winter months over the past several decades many Taliban fighters would head over to Pakistan to rest and recoup. If Biden knew the Feb 2020 agreed upon conditions werent being honored (they werent) and if he was still hellbent on leaving (he was) the very least he should have done was set a Dec departure. This way the fledging Ghani Govt and military could have had 4-5 months to get their footing and build confidence in themselves and one another. This would simply have given them the best chance for success. Again no guarantees they would have survived but not giving them this opportunity was criminally negligent.  So where are we now and where do we go from here?  On July 8th Joe Biden said in no uncertain terms he didnt trust the Taliban. I believe If Im not mistaken he reiterated that same sentiment again today. So that begs the question. If thats true Sir why are you reportedly sharing sensitive contact information and the whereabouts of American citizens with THE TALIBAN? If this is proven to be true Id say it rises to the level of an impeachable offense. Further Mr Biden said today that he would retaliate against those who murdered our Marines. How exactly is that going to be accomplished when hes still ordering our military to runaway and leave by this arbitrary Aug 31st deadline?! Our departure would render the closest base from which to launch a strike about 8 flying hours away!  The Aug 31st deadline is arbitrary. Please make no mistake about that. And now Biden has allowed it to become a Taliban red line?! Since when were these thugs allowed to decide American foreign policy?! Sticking to the 31st is akin to an unconditional surrender. We have 13 new gold star families in the homeland somewhere between 1000-4000 Americans still in theater and thousands more proven Afghan allies in harms way $85 billion in equipment left behind and Biden and his double down woke crew is still insisting on leaving in a few days.  Every military and intelligence advisor and expert agrees we CANNOT evacuate all of the Americans that want to leave by Aug 31st. Same with our allies. Cant do it.  A QUICK SIDE BAR ON BAGRAM AIR BASE  25 miles north of Kabul Airport where are troops are now and where the suicide attack today took place is Bagram Air Base. It was the largest base the US operated in Afghanistan. And we gave it up. Why? Because Joe Biden wouldnt allow for enough US forces present to keep it. So on July 1st 2021 without telling our Afghan allies the last remaining American forces slipped away under cover of night. 7 weeks later the Bagram fell to the Taliban.  History is watching. 20 years of trust has evaporated in 2 months. There are geopolitical implications as well and they reach far beyond Afghanistan. This debacle and Joe Bidens lack of leadership is playing directly into the narrative of the Chinese Communists in Beijing and in Putins Kremlin. They assert that America is a nation in decline and our power is waning. They tell anyone who will listen that the Americans show only weakness to their enemies and are treacherous to their friends. The last two months certainly hasnt assuaged our allies fears in this regard. What do you think our friends in Eastern Europe are thinking right now? Do you think many are sleeping easy tonight in Kiev? Or Lithuania? Or Poland? How about Kuwait? Would we have their backs now?! And there are most definitely millions on the island nation of Taiwan tossing and turning this very night.  Joe Biden proclaimed last month that this wouldnt be another Saigon. Well he was right. Its worse. 13 Americans are dead more wounded scores of the innocent slaughtered and chaos reigns. What should we do to gain some semblance of order sanity honor and standing?  Push the timeline back and declare we will leave when our mission is complete. That mission will be complete after we  1. Take back Bagram 2. Fly in Armor and a sufficient force to hold Bagram evacuate ALL remaining Americans & proven allies 3. Expand and then secure permitted around Kabul Airport 3. Smash ISIS-K and kill every last son of a bitch who planned/ordered/carried out murderous attack on our brave Marines 4. Retrieve sensitive equipment & weaponry and destroy any that cant be securely evacd out 5. If the Taliban resistance persists take back Kabul (by most accounts there are only 6000 Taliban holding the city) and expose them for the bullying thugs that they are.  Once our mission has been accomplished then and only then leave.  I call Nancy Pelosi to immediately bring the House back into session. We are a co-equal branch of government and we must demand answers from this administration. All members of Congress should be briefed on the current situation and all questions from members should be answered in a secure classified setting if necessary in full. Committees of jurisdiction namely Armed Services (of which Im a member) Intel Foreign Affairs and Homeland Security should immediately begin oversight hearings. We must get top Administration officials in front of Congress and hear their sworn testimony. We have to get answers so we can ensure that this never happens again. Ever.  Please join me in keeping our brave warriors in your thoughts hearts and prayers. They gave everything and we owe it to them to give our all to complete the mission. Rest In Peace Heroes.

PRISON FOOD for the MIND  2020 THE Directors Cut  It would only be fitting that ''THE YEAR 2020'' be the opening synopsis of discussion it goes without saying that 2020 in one form or another has left a undeniable imprint on humanity. Mind body heart and spirit has been touched and scarred and in many case's wounds mentally emotionally and physically will never heal. 2020 was a year unlike any mankind has ever witnessed even as I state the obvious the strange thing is it still feels like a understatement. What made 2020 so unforgettable goes without saying but I'll say it anyway the Big Bad and Ugly Corona Virus better know as Covid19. Covid did the unthinkable your race religion and economic status was of no consequence to this juggernaut of a virus saint's and sinners world wide on seven continent's were not immune to the possibility of ones own mortality. For the first time in my life I witnessed a situation that Everyone the emphasis is on Everyone has had to adjust to this new world order. Rich poor good bad beautiful ugly tall short incarcerated not incarcerated educated uneducated liberal conservative Democrat Republican independent blackbrownyellowredwhite and old and young alike and everyone in between are in the cross hair's of a common enemy.  This destroyer of men women and children has extinguished thousands of life's in epic proportions never before seen in modern day history. This notorious ''villain'' Covid19 has bullied the entire world into a matrix of uncertainty. Never before in mankind's illustrious history dating back to the start of civilization has every country's government and all it citizens world wide in all seven continent's shared a level playing field regarding a singular or numerous circumstance be it wealth power oil democracy or healthcare. The list goes on and on nonstop etcetera etceteraetcetera illustrating massive inequities of resources between the wealthiest countries and the poorest countries. Covid19 ''knocked out'' all that history and accomplished what ''fairness'' never succeeded in. What might that be you may ponder........ What might that be you may ask? The answer is simple their were no ''favorites'' or ''underdogs'' when dealing with this plague every country started at ground zero. Meaning superpower countries third world countries and all countries stretched across seven continent's were in the same starting position with equal opportunity to live or die.The best analogy to follow this train of thought is to imagine that every country in the entire world has a automobile that will be entered into a worldwide race envision NASCAR style racing at the Daytona 500 with a caveat of provisions to make interesting.  In a vast majority of the populations worldly mind based off logic and perception one would assume the richest country on earth would win this '''race''. One might expect the United States to enter the race with the fastest technically advanced racing machine the world has ever witnessed. In betting circles the U.S would be a 2 to 1 favorite to win the race. And on the other hand many people would assume a poor county like Wuhan would stand little to no chance of winning this race and would be a long shot and 40 to 1 underdog. The thing about overwhelming favorites is they rarely live up to the hype and the thing about underdog's is they are usually underestimated which motivates them to ascend to greater heights and become victorious. Covid19 is real it's not a game it's not a sport in any literal stretch of the imagination. Metaphorically speaking I used NASCAR as a analogy because in many way's when the citizens of the world were notified that a alien infection known as Cornoavirus entered the atmosphere and was extremely contagious the nations of the world started a ''race'' with life or death implications. As I aforementioned in the chapter every nation in the world and it's citizens started in the same starting position and wealth and power would not cloak countries and it's citizens in immunity against death and destruction anymore then it would poverty stricken and powerless countries.  As of January the first 2021 a new year is upon us. And a entire year has passed since the race against Covid-19 and it's deadly aftermath. The United States of America the richest and most powerful country in the world has seen more deaths of it citizens then any country in the world. More then 350000 plus people in the U.S.A. have become victims of this virus and lost their life's. How did we get to this point ? How has the richest and most powerful country allowed this to happen ? How has United States of America become the pandemic epicenter of the world ? When did America become some American's worst Nightmare realized ? To answer these questions first we must dissect our brains from the very beginning. Close your eye's and let your mind drift back to any given day in January 2020. Can you remember the first time you wore a mask and tried to apply 6 feet social distance to your daily life ? How did you feel about having to wear a mask and having to practice social distancing in public places ? I know many Americans were skeptical and believed that mask and social distancing was a over reaction by state and government official's due to the pandemic that was occurring in China at the time. Many Americans decided to disregard mask and social distancing guidelines and ordinances altogether. Are you one of those American people ? Be honest we're you one of millions of people that deified science and logic and continued a reckless and blatant disregard of human life ?  For some the self reflection questionnaire may come across in a harsh judgemental and accusatory tone but this not my intention. My intention is not to point finger's and lay blame. My intention is not to transport those who answered yes to the question's down a road trip of guilt trip. My questions are valid and important exercise if we are to understand how America became the Biggest ''Loser''. I'm sure my terminology of the word loser attached to America will entice my fair share of detractors who will argue toothed and nail that America is ''winning'' this war against Covid; The population of people in America who fall in this category of thinking share at least one common thread of unity ninety nine percent of these people are Donald Trump supporters and loyalists. In this moment you may be asking yourself where is he going with this and why is it is relevant to know if someone is a Trump supporter in regards to Covid-19. If we are to fully grasps and understand how the richest and most powerful country in the world has 350000 plus casualties we must devour and digest all the ingredients and factor's of humanity that has the nation on brink of no return !  One plus One equals Two Two plus Two equals Four Donald Trump plus Donald Trump equals Division. These mathematics are examples of universal truth. None will dispute my first two examples of truth but about 74000000 people give or take will dispute vehemently how I derived at my third example of truth. To these Trumpeter's I would say numbers don't lie. To these Trumpeter's I would say your mind and conscious are deaf and blind if you can not and will not acknowledge truth. I'm sure Trumpeter's at this very moment are shaking their head's still not convinced. For the sake of argument I will very graciously patiently and meticulously ''show my work'' like a high school math test.....Donald Trump is a demigod to his supporter's and voter's. Donald Trump is divisive and decisive in his agenda to divide the nation into Three section's White America Black America and Hispanic America. Donald Trump succeeded in dividing the country socially with blatant racial rhetoric inspired speeches tweets and propaganda. Donald Trump's toolbox of tool's helped him accomplish division in this country are the same exact tool's that founded this ''Great'' country 500 years ago. Racism Hate Lie's Fear and minimizing the life and liberty of people of color. ''Make America Great Again'' a slogan designed to promote hate and Racism. Donald Trump plus Donald Trump equals division.  Wow is what I'm thinking at this very moment......... Life imitates art is a expression I've heard before in passing but never thought twice about but now I understand the sentiment. Dear Reader's let me explain these surreal emotions I am experiencing.The previous page I wrote about how Donald Trump plus Donald Trump equals division from there I unleashed a logical spiel about why I believed this to be a unquestioned truth. Coincidentally I began writing the previous page at literally 6:13 a.m. on January 6 2021 the same day the Senate in Washington D.C. convened to vote yay or nay to certificate the electoral college vote regarding the presidential election. Who knew that January 6 2021 would be a historical infamous shameful and none to surprising day in the illustrious ''Great'' American history. For four years Donald Trump has used every trick up his sleeve to corrupt the hearts minds and the will of the American people. It is said that every action has a reaction; It is said that what you put in a relationship is what you get out a relationship; Hate racism stereotypes and intolerance is what he ''fed'' the American people and seems as if sixty percent of white American gobbled up the propaganda with a ravenous appetite and craved and begged unapologetically for seconds................and as it stands currently their hunger is insatiable and will never be satisfied............Donald Trump action's fractured the Spirit of America and divided the Soul's.  by American X,political,Facebook

An open letter to Lovettsville Mayor Fontaine and the Lovettsville Town Council  Happy pride month! This is a month for celebrating our LGBTQ+ neighbors right to be accepted happy and free. As you already know equal rights for others does not mean fewer rights for you. Its not pie as they say.  I am heartsick to learn the news of the hate crimes committed against Lovettsville Rainbow House (check post comments for links & context). I am even further dismayed by the mayor and town councils lack of a Pride Month proclamation. I am of the mindset that anything other than repeated public official statements in support of our LGBTQ+ neighbors is an endorsement of crimes committed against these same neighbors.  The elite have been pitting poor white and black people against each other since the first days of our nation. This same manipulation manifests itself time and time again. This sickness is allowed to spread when leaders do not speak and act against it.  As elected leader in the era where this divisiveness has become magnified through technology it is our duty to push back against all manifestations of this hateful manipulative dynamic. It requires us to think critically through the lens of compassion. It requires us to listen deeply to the fears and concerns of people who are in some ways very different from us.  One of Americas greatest accomplishments was defeating a fascist racist Nazi sickness that had taken hold in Europe. This great moment in history required unprecedented collaboration unified sustained effort and immeasurable courage. I summon these ideals here today to challenge you to join me in honoring themin honoring Americaby standing up to those who are judged taunted abused and murdered because of their differences.  Do you have the courage to challenge your own misperceptions and the misperceptions of your peer groups to truly embody the American ideal that we all deserve to be safe and free?  I stand before you as a fellow elected leader as your neighbor across the water. I stand in defense of the Lovettsville Rainbow House.I stand for what is right and good. I will not sleepwe will not sleep and we will not relent until we are all truly free. Please join us.  Regards - Christopher Vigliotti - Brunswick Maryland City Council Member,political,Facebook
"WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE A CHRISTIAN TODAY?  We live in a very divided environment. Each day we see stories about abortion while at the same time seeing stories about people being tried in the courts for abusing an animal. We see stories about sky rocketing incidents or murder with guns. The guns are generally vilified while the people using the guns are given a pass. We see stories about tax free status for Christians being denied because Christians are generally Republicans. We see stories about all members of the white race being condemned as racists while on the other hand black lives matter. We see stories portraying our nation the United States of America as an outgrowth of slavery rather than as a continuing search for liberty and freedom. Our nation is described as a flawed and terrible place rather than an imperfect ideal searching for greater and greater perfection. Christians are under greater siege now than at any time in the past 100 years.  As these things continue to occur I feel that those who follow Jesus Christ thus who believe that he is the Son of God and the gate on the path to eternal life are being treated as members of a cult where each member believes in an invisible fantasy in a comic book story in a fictional concoction with no real meaning. I also believe there are real reasons Christians are portrayed in this manner.  First many many churches contribute to this fantasy. With their beautiful buildings and symbols with their order and structure with their entertaining music and continuous social activities; with the Sunday School classes and fellowship meetings with the meals and the yard sales with the choruses and bands with the internal networking churches provide a structure that makes both members and guests feel wanted feel cared for feel like they are joining something important. Sometimes this is true. Sometimes it is a facade; a lie.  Christians believers in Jesus Christ are not club members who can be a little bit in or half-way in. Christians are all the way in. They believe in Jesus Christ. They develop their lives around faith in Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ dictates their actions and their thoughts. This is not to say believers are perfect or even nearly perfect. As hard as they try to live as Christ lived they fall short. All members of mankind are sinners; we all fall short. During these trying times it isn't just individual Christians who fall short: it is the Church as an institution that is falling short.  In the United States of America two parts; the establishment clause and the free exercise clause of the First Amendment of the Constitution guarantee that the government will not and can not interfere with the free exercise of religion. However over the past eighteen months churches in mass have kowtowed to the government shuttered their doors locked out their congregations and failed to carry out even the most oft quoted command of our God ""Fear Not."" They have willingly given up their freedom under the Constitution and failed to obey God. This surrender of autonomy this abdication of authority has totally undermined the importance of organized religion in our country. Instead of acting independently to go forward in their collective trust in the sanctity and authority of Jesus Christ they have surrendered to fear. Instead of moving forward with their activities while at the same time presenting alternatives to those who did fear the churches closed their doors and became social media platforms; just another source of information. Organized churches stripped off the armor of God and bared themselves to the assaults of heathens.  At the same time they were giving away their power and authority the churches failed to take firm stands against sins clearly enunciated in the Bible. They failed to take a stand within the constraints of the Word of God. Thousands of churches condone and accept abortion of children. Thousands of additional churches accept the leadership of those bragging about and consistently seeking deviant life styles; lives as homosexuals or lesbians; lives as bisexuals; lives during which they surgically change the characteristics of their biological gender or lifestyles during which they claim to be of a different gender or of no gender. They celebrate their ""pride"" in their deviance. Though the church is entrusted to accept these behaviors; after all they are simply different sins from stealing lying cheating worshipping idols etc.; the church should always accept these behaviors with the grace and tolerance of knowing that those who believe will seek to minimize to eliminate the frequency of their sinning; that they will strive to achieve a more sin free life. Many many churches are failing to accomplish even that. Additional churches are accepting of these behaviors to the point of putting those who practice this behavior into leadership positions. Satan leading the flock. How appropriate in this evil society in which we live.  Of even greater import to those who attend traditional churches should be the lack of outreach the failure to carry out the instructions of Jesus Christ to love our neighbors to treat our neighbors as ourselves to help others. Many churches have little or not outreach few or no ministries designed to help those around them. Tens of thousands of churches do little more than maintain the building in which they meet and pay those tasked with instructing them in the ways of Jesus Christ. If it were not so sad it would be almost humorous that three average guys have met every week face to face in the homes of one another each Sunday fixed a breakfast each week engaged in fellowship conducted a sermon or class every seven days periodically offered Communion developed a website and a local presence and conduct many many ministries within our community. Not only do we build the occasional ramp for the handicapped provide food boxes to elderly Jews support Angel Tree programs for many children assist with the care of the homeless send the children of incarcerated men and women to summer camps but are also active in assisting other ministries to obtain and build busses for use during emergencies support Kairos to visit and minister to those incarcerated participate in the multi-denominational men's group in Northeaster North Carolina but also support Emmaus to provide more intensive support to practicing Christians. To be blunt we are not scared have not been scared and have blatantly disobeyed the governments attempts to control us. Furthermore as a group we have been chastised by other Christians for our beliefs and our actions.  Jesus Christ did not have an easy life. Being a man is not easy. Following Jesus Christ is not easy and it was never intended to be so. If you are going to proclaim yourself to be a Christian it is time to open your hearts attempt to discern what God is telling you to do put on your big-boy pants and start doing your jobs. Though Jesus Christ never coined ""The Great Commission"" he did tell us to make disciples of all nations and to baptize them. Go out and do it. Do not allow others to tell you that you are wrong and can not do it. GO OUT AND DO! Being a Christian is being in action.",political,Facebook

This statement resulted in a massive and unified democratic outcry in calling Scott an Uncle Tom and the like. That is easy to understand because one of the only remaining reasons the democratic party wins anymore is their deception about horrible racism in America.

Lets try to have an adult conversation about gun control if that is possible. First lets be honest mass killings are just a part actually a small part of the problem of gun violence. Many more people die every year by guns then just by mass shootings. I do think we need to stop all the rhetoric scare tactics and extremism on both sides. (Before I start I am not a gun expert so if my terminology is off I apologize now) First off lets be honest with our selves America will never ban all guns. There is no will among politicians or the people for a complete ban and their are already too many legal and illegal guns out there to ever completely ban. SO lets all admit a complete ban is off the table. I believe the vast majority of Americans have no issue with legal handguns hunting rifles and shotguns. Do we agree? On the other hand I think most reasonable people agree everyday people should not be allowed to own fully automatic machine guns bazookas rocket propelled grenades any grenade bombs missiles tanks fighter jets aircraft carriers etc etc. You get my point. So basically that means the only argument comes down to semi automatic long guns (Assault rifles etc.). Personally I believe these types of weapons should be banned for a couple of reasons. First I thin these weapons are good for one thing only  and that is killing human beings. Second by taking them off the streets it makes our police safer. Lastly they are the weapon of choice of mass shooters. That being said I dont think the right will ever go for a ban. Therefore I would suggest for these types of weapons a special license should be required that would require a exam psych evaluation enhanced background check and weapon registration. Any valid gun owner should have no issue with this. If you do you probably want your guns for another nefarious reason. That being said to me there are other things we should do to cut down on gun violence and on the lethality of guns. 1) There should be a limit on the amount of ammo you can buy 2) So called cop killer bullets should be outlawed 3) Extended magazines should be outlawed 4) Gun manufacturers should be required to have finger print unlock on all weapons 5) The selling of conversion kits should be illegal 6) Greatly increase the amount of money for the ATF to track down illegal weapons. I would suggest by cutting down on how much we spend to prosecute and imprison minor drug crimes 7) Create gun buy back programs Here in Orlando there has been a very successful program started by a local radio program that over the past 15 years has got thousands of guns turned in including one year a TOW missile launcher. 8) Increase red flag programs. Research has shown they work. 9) Close the background check loop hole 10) Make parents responsible for crimes committed by children using their gun. 11) Develop a national database for background checks. Police Departments health care professionals and Justice systems should be held criminally responsible if not updated timely Lastly and a big one. To assure the 2nd Amendment people. Work towards a Constitutional Amendment that clarifies the 2nd Amendment to state that you have the right to own guns for self protection of yourself your loved ones and your property That's what I got folks. I know as they say the devil is in the details however this my basis to start. I think everything here is the basis to begin to put together comprehensive gun control plan to make Americans safer without infringing on the their rights.,political,Facebook

Ive studied the signs of the times and believe were approaching a global cataclysmone predicted in our Scriptures and unfolding before our eyes.  All this came to me in a sort of rush months ago as my wife Donna and I were watching the morning newsevery story more distressing than the one before. We sat there viewing the burning cities backbiting politicians runaway infections heated elections social upheaval racial tensions skyrocketing crime shouting pundits deafening lies eroding sands and cracking foundations.  I said to her: You and I are watching the dismantling of America. My new book Where Do We Go From Here? was born in that moment.  I began to look at these crises and controversies in a new way. I realized they are not isolated movements philosophies or events. They are as interconnected as a spiders web....  Emerging globalism. Our worldwide economy hanging by a strand. The degradation of our culture. An eagerness to cancel anyone who disagrees. Unprecedented spiritual famine. Professed Christians abandoning the faith. The rising tide of Marxism. Jerusalem turning into the powder keg of historyagain! Plus a pandemic.  Ive told you all that to say this: I refuse to be discouraged and so should you!  Ive preached and written about the last days from the beginning of my ministry...But Ive never written a prophecy book like this one. -Dr. David Jeremiah Where Do We Go From Here?

"Greetings Family! We are planning to celebrate the ancestor Dr. King on (MLK Day). We hope to get as many of you involved in his remembrance as possible. While also looking to what he stood and died for as guidance in our action steps towards spiritual and physical health/wealth in this year 2021.  - A few weeks before Martin Luther King's assassination. High-lighting America's racial inequities during a speech on his ""Poor People's Campaign"". He ended one of his powerful quotes like this: ""we are coming to get our check!""  - Another not so fun fact: It is said that doctor(s) said that ""if the bullet hadn't killed him"" ""a heart attack would have""! This quote was supposedly in reference to the unhealthy state of Dr. King's internal organs at the time of his murder.  So what we do know is that Dr. King liked his southern ""soul food"" (i.e. fried chicken smothered steak mac and cheese pecan pie etc.) and cigarettes. These facts are also key to this post. Because health is wealth family!!!  Therefore I'm asking y'all to attach a video photo story poem action steps etc. in our comment section. That expresses celebration of MLK and/or representations of health and wealth for you your family and our communities.  For example: At Town and City Permaculture we are going to upload a video of our preparation of a healthy plant-based meal in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.  Please do the same or add other creative comments!",political,Facebook
"       I am an 18-year resident of Belle Mead that attended Thursdays Township Committee Meeting (October 21st) via its Zoom protocol. My singular purpose for attending was simply to learn when meetings will return to in-person meetings.  My Zoom session began just before the official meeting start and the first thing I hear is          -         . In tyrannical countries this is true however Mr. Schuldiner's attitude is not in sync with America in that we live in a free country with a second amendment right to bear arms that protects Americas freedom from tyranny. When I was recognized to speak I lectured Mr. Schuldiner that no elected official should ever quote communist leaders in public. The second bizarre occurrence was during the Pledge of Allegiance. Only Township Administrator Donato Neiman could be heard saying the pledge; no one stood and no one held their right hand over their hearts. So I had to ask why no one could hear anybody but Mr. Nieman reciting their Pledge of Allegiance to our country. The next odd moment came when Committee Woman Neena Singh was given the floor to brief us all on the meaning of Diwali as its celebration is November 4th. In many other circumstances this would be interesting information except that one would think that only official business would be conducted during these meetings. So I asked that the Township Committee consider equal time for a similar briefing on the meaning of Christmas as we approach December 25th. Finally I asked the question that I had Zoomed in for - the timing of the return of in-person meetings. I was informed by Mr. Schuldliner that this would be decided in 2022 when the new Township Committee was in place. Suddenly I found myself staring at a blank screen and received a message that I had been blocked after numerous attempts to log back into the meeting. These people had censored me. My point had been proven: Zoom meetings make it simple to censor citizens that our elected officials do not respect. Hence the importance of holding our elected officials accountable through in-person meetings. The sooner our Township Committee returns to in-person meetings the sooner this bunch can begin to demonstrate accountability and begin to earn back our trust.  Meanwhile in-person meetings better return in January 2022.""  Jeffrey Grant Belle Mead",political,Facebook
"Why is Joe Biden at war with The American People ? He is almost always holding millions of American people in contempt and reprimanding them. In this day and age of audio and video how can you change what you say and your position in a matter of days. Even Jen Psaki his press secreatary seems to lie about what she previously says almost all the time. It is a daily occurrence with this administration. Idiots it is recorded by audio and video in your own words. You look more stupid false and fraudulent. One minute they say that they will not mandate a vaccine shot the next minute they say they will mandate vaccinations. They are such liars and hypocrites almost on every subject they talk about. They left Americans behind in Afghanistan when they in their own words said that they would not leave any Americans behind. Biden is now accusing the people for the problems he and his administation have created. For every failure it is someone else who is at fault according to him. You would think that after almost 50 years in public service you would have learnt some basic lessons of governing and leadership but not Joe Biden. He has always been wrong and now he is a catastrophe on domestic and foreign policy. The country is in such unease and in so much distress and fear. The Afghanistan debacle high inflation high food and gas prices record drug addiction and homelessnessenergy dependence in a matter of months monumental spending and debt and a Covid disaster. Add to this high unemployment but a shortage of workers since the government pays people not to work. The border disaster and our loss of respect worldwide from friends and foes.Biden and the democrats are truly enemies of the country and the people. With the help of the media and extremist groups they smear and demonize more than half the population with false narratives and fake crises and divide the country by ideology and race and ethnicity and religion and skin color. They do all this because they are completely void of new ideas and cannot ever rule a united people. They need to rule ""The unUnited States of America"".",political,Facebook
Copied and shared...  Dear FDA Thank you for allowing Scott Gottlieb to be the commissioner of FDA and then allowing him to profit from Pfizer the drug company.

Of course dead food in a box coated in sugar would be healthier than enzymes and fiber rich nutrient-dense delicious fruit. What was I thinking!? Thank you for the blessing of artificial sweeteners!

Man if we would have simply stuck to all natural God-given sweeteners  the pharmaceutical companies would have gone out of business. Cant have that!

Thank you for Red Dye #40 and Yellow #5 linked to cancer and proven to cause hyperactivity in kids... we mom's especially thank you. Big hugs on that one.

Dear Senator Joe Manchin III   I recently had a heart-breaking conversation with my father that has caused me to reach out to you. Hes been practicing as an emergency medical physician for more than forty years an impressive feat for a Black man raised in the era of Jim Crow. The recent renewed efforts to silence Black Americans caused him to reach this conclusion:  Son it looks like Jim Crow is coming back and well have to find a way to live with it.  The resignation in his voice revealed a deep sense of dismay for his country and fear for his grandchildrens future. The last time I heard him speak with such unbearable sadness was at my mothers funeral in 1998. He is a moderate democrat much like yourself and while his experience of America differs greatly from your own he would agree with your words below:  The right to vote is fundamental to our American democracy and protecting that right should not be about party or politics.  In this regard you and I have a common understanding: every American has a constitutional right to participate in this democracy. However determining the necessary actions of protecting these rights is where we differ. While one might feel that a bipartisan compromise is the only way to preserve our nation one cannot bargain with politicians who actively work to suppress the historically disenfranchised to protect the Republican influence of their respective states.  In late May you said that you needed ten good people (Republicans) for you to vote in favor of the For the People Voting Rights Act. Though you were not specific one could assume that you were referring to those who voted for President Trumps impeachment.  Rep. Peter Meijer R-Mich.; Rep. David Valadao R-Calif.; Rep. Dan Newhouse R-Wash.; Rep. John Katko R-N.Y.; Rep. Adam Kinzinger R-Ill.; Rep. Jamie Herrera Beutler R-Wash.;Rep. Tom Rice R-S.C.; Fred Upton R-Mich.; Rep. Anthony Gonzalez R-Ohio; Liz Cheney R-Wyo.  While it certainly took courage to vote against their party leader I cannot share in your optimism. Throughout the United States most notably in the southern states voter suppression laws are being passed and considered by Republican legislature determined to silence non-white and impoverished voices. In particular Michigan Wyoming and Ohio - the resident states of three aforementioned good people - are all considering further ways to restrict access to registration and polling places. Even the recently censured Representative Liz Cheney has demonstrated support for some of these restrictive practices.  Whats further troubling is the lacking specificity in your critique of the For the People Voting Rights Act. Although you oppose the partisan appearance of the act you do not cite anything that is wrong with the bill itself. After reviewing your website and media appearances I could not find a critique of the elements in the bill.  The For the People Voting Rights Act would modernize voter registration increase secure access to the ballot box ensure flexibility for those who must vote early or absentee and increase the participation of Americans in our democracy. However rather than point out flaws or debate the nature of these elements your main point of contention is that not enough Republicans agree. I am left to assume that you know the bill is the right thing for the country but will only support it if there is bipartisan support.  I point to your vote in favor of the January 6th Commission. Despite not having ten brave Republicans you voted in favor of the commission and made the following statement:  Choosing to put politics and political elections above the health of our Democracy is unconscionable. And the betrayal of the oath we each take is something they will have to live with.  These should be the words of a man who does what is right even when he does not have the support from his peers.  Senator Manchin America cannot wait for ten good Republicans. Since 2020 legislatures in 47 states have been presented with 361 bills with restrictive voter provisions. Many of the good Republicans youre waiting on have supported these restrictive bills fought the 2020 census or questioned the integrity of the previous election.  Refusing to support this voting rights bill will force many Americans to choose between work and exercising their vote; limit the number of available polling places; deny funding to upgrade electoral commissions and systems; and further the silence of poor and minority Americans  These actions to target and silence non-white Americans are not unfamiliar nor are the legislative tools used. While you believe the filibuster is integral for compromise it has long been wielded as a whip to silence Black representation. John C. Calhoun used the filibuster so effectively to protect slavery that his bigoted predecessors did not hesitate to use it against the Dyer Anti-lynching BIll (1922); the Civil Rights Act of 1957; and again in 1964.  To put it concisely Senator one cannot compromise with a party that believes in the lie of a stolen election. One should not compromise for the sake of appearing bipartisan for that would be sacrificing the voting rights of Americans to placate a false concern of election integrity. That is not compromise that is appeasement for the only beneficiaries in this illusion of compromise are Republicans seeking the favor of a shadow president and not the American people.

The United States in many ways needs to go 'back to the future.'  In 1915 we became the world's largest creditor nation meaning we lent more money to other nations than borrowing it by having the strongest manufacturing industries production capacities and real money reserves (gold) than any other country. In 2021 the United States has become the world's largest debtor nation meaning we owe more money to the rest of the world than the rest of the world owes to us and we no longer rely on investment profits to raise money but instead finance more and more of public spending through debt monetization (printing money) instead of selling bonds to the private sector or through taxes). In decades past the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944 established a payment system based on the dollar as the world's new reserve currency. The dollar was tied to gold until 1971 when President Nixon took the world off of the gold standard. The world has changed a lot since 1971 however. Many nations no longer want to be tied to the dollar as the world's reserve currency. Russia and China in particular have been buying tons of gold in the past few years and are beginning to disinvest themselves from U.S. treasury bonds. Also as more companies and millions of people are investing in alternative currencies like Bitcoin America has to adapt and stay ahead of the economic waves of change coming. Currencies backed by nothing except trust and tradition have to realize that payment systems and transactions of goods like oil (once solely transacted in petro dollars) are beginning to move into and accept other terms. So what does all of this mean for the United States? It means that our reliance on a never ending dominance of the dollar as the world's reserve currency is changing and we have to be ingenious enough to once again find creative ways (without force or intimidation) to be a world leader in all the things we used to be. We have to deal with reality and realize that printing money in the trillions with no consequences is a fool's errand. We have to return to a sound money system before other nations like China and Russia pull the rug out from under our eyes and back their own currencies with a sound money standard that will attract nations away from the dollar because it will be backed by gold. We can't rely on past glories going into the future. We must rebuild our manufacturing base in many industries step by step and rid ourselves of overly complacent ways.,political,Facebook

From Ken Ham  America is in a mess spiritually morally and politically. How should we understand what is happening? Should our emphasis be one of trying to save America? First how does God view America or any nation? Behold the nations are like a drop from a bucket and are accounted as the dust on the scales. (Isaiah 40:15) Should we look to man to solve the problems in this nation? It is better to take refuge in the LORD than to trust in man (Psalm 118:8). Stop regarding man in whose nostrils is breath for of what account is he? (Isaiah 2:22) Oh grant us help against the foe for vain is the salvation of man! With God we shall do valiantly; it is he who will tread down our foes. (Psalm 60:1112) Thus says the LORD: Cursed is the man who trusts in man and makes flesh his strength whose heart turns away from the LORD. He is like a shrub in the desert and shall not see any good come. He shall dwell in the parched places of the wilderness in an uninhabited salt land. Blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD whose trust is the LORD. (Jeremiah 17:57) Should we look to politicians to solve the problems? Put not your trust in princes in a son of man in whom there is no salvation. When his breath departs he returns to the earth; on that very day his plans perish. (Psalm 146:34) Should we look to an army to solve the problems? The king is not saved by his great army; a warrior is not delivered by his great strength. The war horse is a false hope for salvation and by its great might it cannot rescue. Behold the eye of the LORD is on those who fear him on those who hope in his steadfast love that he may deliver their soul from death and keep them alive in famine. Our soul waits for the LORD; he is our help and our shield. (Psalm 33:1620) What is wrong with the nation? To quote my good friend Ray Comfort this nation could be summed up this way: The nation forgot the Lord their God who had blessed them abundantly and had instead given itself to lawlessness and slaughtering their own offspring in the womb. Therefore the judgment of God fell upon them. In many ways this fits with what God was saying to the people at the time of Hosea. The LORD has a controversy with the inhabitants of the land. There is no faithfulness or steadfast love and no knowledge of God in the land. (Hosea 4:1) How then should we deal with these problems? America or any nation is not going to last forever but the souls of people will live forever. Surely our emphasis should be on seeing souls saved for eternity through salvation in Christ. This Jesus. . . . And there is salvation in no one else for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved. (Acts 4:1112) The same God who spoke to Solomon about the people of Israel is the same God who is watching over everything today: If my people who are called by my name humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and heal their land. (2 Chronicles 7:14) Yes so many people in this nation including many rulers (politicians judges etc.) have turned their backs on God. They have rejected God and his Word in the education systems. They have sacrificed millions of children to the god of self. They have rejected God in many ways through rejecting prayer rejecting nativity scenes and crosses and replacing the truth of God as Creator for the lie of evolution. (Even many church leaders and Christian academics have compromised Gods Word with evolutionary ideas.) For although they knew God they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him but they became futile in their thinking and their foolish hearts were darkened. Claiming to be wise they became fools and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things. (Romans 1:2123) How does God view the plans of rulers who reject him? Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain? The kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers take counsel together against the LORD and against his Anointed saying Let us burst their bonds apart and cast away their cords from us. He who sits in the heavens laughs; the Lord holds them in derision. Then he will speak to them in his wrath and terrify them in his fury saying As for me I have set my King on Zion my holy hill. (Psalm 2:16) Is America under judgment? This description in Romans chapter 1 certainly fits with what we are experiencing. And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done. They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness evil covetousness malice. They are full of envy murder strife deceit maliciousness. They are gossips slanderers haters of God insolent haughty boastful inventors of evil disobedient to parents foolish faithless heartless ruthless. Though they know Gods righteous decree that those who practice such things deserve to die they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them. (Romans 1:2832) What can we do? We need to tell the nations about the one true God and about the message of salvation that only he provides: Oh sing to the LORD a new song; sing to the LORD all the earth! Sing to the LORD bless his name; tell of his salvation from day to day. Declare his glory among the nations his marvelous works among all the peoples! For great is the LORD and greatly to be praised; he is to be feared above all gods. For all the gods of the peoples are worthless idols but the LORD made the heavens. Splendor and majesty are before him; strength and beauty are in his sanctuary. (Psalm 96:16) And we should pray without ceasing (1 Thessalonians 5:17) for the souls of those who have rejected him. And remember  theres a raging spiritual war but: For the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh but have divine power to destroy strongholds 2 Corinthians 10:4.,political,Facebook

The horrific attack in Kabul that killed 13 U.S. service members devastated every patriotic American. My prayers go out to families and loved ones of these American Heroes.  This is a heartbreaking time for our country. As Commander-In-Chief The Presidents responsibility is to safely evacuate every American citizen from Afghanistan and keep our troops away from unnecessary risk.  My casework staff is working around-the-clock to help during this crisis. We are working with many families to process requests from families seeking assistance with evacuation. If you or someone you know is trying to get out of Afghanistan please contact my office. We will provide all assistance possible and keep you apprised of the most up-to-date information during this rapidly changing situation.  s self-imposed deadline of August 31st to withdraw from Afghanistan should be amended until all U.S. citizens are evacuated. Tragically it is clear that the President has no concrete answers or plan to rescue the American people or allies who are still stranded in Afghanistan.  This botched withdrawal from Afghanistan is the most colossal military and foreign policy failure since President Carters mishandling of Iran.  President Biden is responsible for the incompetent decision-making that has needlessly killed U.S. troops placed American citizens in harms way gifted $87 billion of sophisticated U.S. military equipment to the Taliban and destroyed U.S. prestige.
