"Why Overstating Mass Shootings May Make Matters Worse by Matt Carden  Earlier this week I wrote an article about politicians and the media saying there had been over 250 Mass Shootings so far this year alone. I argued and continue to argue that his number is deceptive. I was questioned by one reader who implied I was being callus and the victims did not matter to me. The reader asked how many were too many for me.  One murder a year is too many for me. One mass shooting is too many for me. Anyone who knows me (and this reader does know me) should know I believe this passionately.  I am also concerned with the dialogue that is filling the airwaves. When an individual or the media use the term ""mass shooting"" casually they are doing a disservice to victims and complicating or preventing the search for real solutions to the problem.  The 253 mass shootings that are listed in the (supposed) Gun Violence database represent a multitude of problems with vastly different solutions. Some of the events that are casually lumped together under the heading ""mass shootings"" include gang related drive by shootings. Other events include ""family annihilators"" and still others are simple drug related homicides.  The over 250 number is one used by certain politicians and political groups to advance their agenda. They search for a way to make the number as high as possible to create public outrage hoping to force the changes they desire. But by doing this we run the risk of creating a ""solution"" that does not fit the problem. This is a disservice to the public and disrespectful to the victims.  Take the ""family annihilators""- these are people who kill their spouse and children or if they do not have a spouse just the children and often themselves. If an annihilator has four victims the event goes in the mass shooting database. But a solution of ""gun control"" will not stop this type event. A family annihilator is ""driven"" to wipe out the family. The weapon they use is irrelevant. Sometimes the weapon used is carbon monoxide. The annihilator packs the family in the car in the garage with the door closed and starts the engine. Sometimes it is drowning- they drive the car with the family off a bridge. Or the weapon could be a knife. With these type events having a gun does not matter. The annihilator becomes convinced they must destroy the family so they use anything they can to kill everyone in the family. We will never see a decrease in this type event from gun control. However we may see a decrease if we improve the mental health system and mental health care access.  Likewise banning guns will not stop drug related homicides- the murders will happen with knives. For this situation the solutions would seem to need to be treatment for the underlying drug addictions. Addressing the socio-economic issues in areas with high gang activity could be a solution for gang related violence that is lumped in as ""mass shootings.""  Terrorism related mass murders will also not be stopped by any type of gun control measure unfortunately. These killers want to create terror. They will use trucks; they will use aircraft; they will use fertilizer and diesel fuel. They will use any weapon that kills as many as possible and creates a huge impact. Terrorists do not quietly kill with poison- unless they are trying to kill thousands at once nor will they try to kill in a way that no one will detect. They WANT people to see the murders. They WANT people talking about the murders and mostly they WANT the mass terror. Really the murder itself is irrelevant to them- the terror the fear the distrust that comes from the event is what they really want.  By looking at the problems as smaller subsets with different solutions the ""Political"" picture changes. By pushing the ""over 250 Mass Shootings This Year Alone"" mantra certain people and groups try to force the dialogue to a direction they want. So the question must be asked is the goal of those politicians who are out there saying ""We have had over 250 Mass Shootings this Year- the time to ban assault weapons is NOW REALLY to save lives or is their goal to ban guns? Looking at the numbers it does not seem to be that they want to save lives.  Do we need to stop these mass shootings  ABSOLUTELY! So instead of scaring people into a ""solution"" that will not work lets break the numbers down. Lets talk about Mental Health care reform and increasing access to mental health care in areas where that could make a difference. Lets talk about improving the socio-economic situation in gang infested areas- if the gangs go away- evaporate- so will the gang violence. Likewise banning guns will not stop drug related homicides- the murders will happen with knives. For this the solutions would seem to need to be treatment for the underlying drug addictions.  ""We have had over 250 Mass Shootings this Year- the time to ban assault weapons is NOW"" - we have heard this sound bite all week. But not once have we heard that Rifles - ALL TYPES of Rifles- only account for an average less than 320 homicides a year over the period 2013-2017 (inclusive) according to the FBI Expanded Homicide Data (table 8- weapons used in homicides). Less than 320 for ALL TYPES of RIFLES- ""assault rifles"" account for less than the 320. So the ""SOLUTION"" of banning ""Assault Rifles"" would never solve the problem of ""Mass Shootings.""  Let's START talking about REAL solutions. Lets START talking about solving the root causes of violence- rather than grouping all these murders together in an effort to win a political battle and watching the same number of mass shootings occur next year and letting more people die.  #GoodGuyWithGun #MassKilling #Terrorism",political,Facebook

The Wedge  Im proudly a child of the 80s. The music was great fashion not so great and the Cold War was still present but a far cry from the Cuban Missile Crisis of the 1960s. We as a nation by and large recognized ourselves as part of an American family so to speak and the world as it were seemed safe. Whether you loved him or hated him The Reagan principle of Peace through Strength kept the world on as even of a keel as one could ask for. I played after school incessantly with my friends and we had a favorite game called War. The rules were simple as one might imagine each kid brought his biggest and best toy guns and we played for hours a breed of hide n seek only with weapons. To my knowledge none of my former playmates to this day have ever been involved in a mass shooting. Looking through the prism of history it was a glorious time where for once the old divisions did not seem to matter anymore. Minorities and women had ascended to some of the highest levels of leadership and industry and as a rule the term race and racism seemed to be remnants of a bygone era. Today there exist a wedge that has been driven like a wooden stake straight through the heart of this country. It has pitted us against each other in a way that I personally never thought we could develop into. It is though we have been separated and resegregated based on characteristics that run antithetical to everything the Civil Rights Movement stood for. What is the wedge exactly and more importantly how did we get here? To have an honest discussion about this topic we must all concede that leaders no matter what their stripes have the ability to be polarizing. I categorize two types of polarizing figures. There are those that are polarizing for the right reasons and those that divide for every reason that is wrong. For example Ben Shapiro in my opinion a polarizing figure for the right reasons. He makes honest fair assessments of situations in a time where for some reason this is looked upon as divisive hate speech even white supremacy which is remarkably interesting when you take into account that Ben Shapiro is an Orthodox Jew. Then you have the Linda Sarsars of the world whose rhetoric and speech are not only hateful but backed up in no way by fact or reason. As we all know Ben Shapiro should not be a polarizing figure but is because the time of real true free speech is over. Stereotypes as well have made a huge return only now the focus seems to be on mainly white America. If we are to have a true discussion we must be honest. Is there any other ethnicity in America today that is subjected to the level of sensitivity training and whatever else they can think of to somehow make white people feel bad about themselves? If that kind of action were perpetrated on any other ethnic group in this country it would be a return to slave days I guess Im not sure where you really go once youve played the Jim Crow Card. The leadership in Washington though divided by obvious ideological differences are all capable of injecting themselves into situations where it is not needed or make a bone headed statement that only serves to fan the flames of whatever the divide may be. In the years since the 80s and leading into the modern times the division has come at the hands of neo-progressives who seek to silence any opinion that might challenge their deeply held beliefs. Notice I did not say the left because quite frankly I grew up side by side with the left and the right but this new breed of ultra-left thinkers have somehow managed to find a way to completely dominate the narrative in this nation. Perhaps even worse though the ugly specter of racism has returned but it is a form of racism that is by and large imagined and always rooted in suppositions that just do not make any sense. The United States in many ways is comparable to a High School. Where there is an endless number of cliques each convinced of their superior thought and superior ideas. What has come to pass as a superior idea in contemporary society can be as simple as a completely reality detached statement made by someone paid millions of dollars to play a game. Nothing on its face seems to make much sense anymore. Its as though every positive statement about America has a but. We are a compassionate and generous nation but we are systemically racist internally. Millions of people from all over the world dream of making it to our shores but we are an extremely oppressive society especially with those that are different from us. Of course you receive the same chorus of statements that get more to the point. America is driven by white supremacy. America is and always has been about inequality. With the presence of such inane and blanket statements where does anyone find any common ground? When one makes a blanket statement about an entire race of people how do you approach that person and try to have a dialogue to try and better understand why it is they feel this way. With the actions of the past year getting a man on the street opinion might get you beat up. It is like we are all out to get each other but for what. Does Black America really believe that myself and millions just like me hate them and think that somehow they are less than in my eyes. It is a proposition that sounds absolutely ludicrous and yet I guarantee you could find quite a few people who believe that. How did people in America come to think such things politics plain and simple. In the days before the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the accompanying Civil Rights Movement black Americans especially those in the south found themselves not much better off than the days that they were in bondage. Back breaking work share cropping and making barely enough to keep your family fed. This time in American history is where we witnessed a mass migration to the cities of America in search of not only jobs but a hope to escape the segregation and subhuman treatment of the deep south. In the cities there were jobs to be had and money to be made for those that possessed the entrepreneurial spirit. It seemed like a perfect formula. The only problem was is that though black America thought that the north was this place where racism somehow did not exist or at least not as bad as what they had experienced outside the city. However they would find like in all big cities people are by and large neo-phobic. As a result they saw that even though they had made the move to the city the racism and discrimination still existed. The wages were there but were usually barely enough to keep a roof over your head and food on the table. Slowly but surely the inner cities of the US became harder and harder places to live as violence and crime began to run rampant. The poverty and despair that existed back then that still to this day causes so many to think that the only way out is to turn to fast money. Pity that fast money and crime are almost synonymous with each other. In the 1960s post JFK the POTUS was a rather vile racist Im not proud to say is from my home State of Texas. Lyndon Baines Johnson was one of those Presidents whose legacy is bathed in young Americans blood and rife with racist policies that have helped more than anything to mold society into what it is today. At the time minorities in the inner cities were certainly victims and at that time I think the idea of welfare as a means to get you on your feet was not such a bad policy. Almost from the start though folks were gaming and using the system so that they could stay home all day and do whatever they wanted so long as the check kept coming every month. My paternal Grandfather of whom I am proudly his namesake passed away in 1966 leaving my Grandma to take care of herself and four kids. Though no one in the world could think of a more deserving family in need of help my Grandma refused to go on welfare. She elected instead to take a job as a Secretary and worked for almost 50 years in that field. An old friend of my Grandpa built houses and let my Grandma finance through his company and though it was hard my Dad and his three siblings never wanted for anything. My Dad told me that sometimes it annoyed him that the people on welfare made more money than his family and never lifted a finger. Welfare was meant to be a temporary fix but as LBJ knew full well it was an elaborate ruse to turn the minorities of this nation into a dependent class of citizens. Is it any wonder that crime remained even metastasized in some cases and slowly but surely the fatherless rate began to increase? The biggest cause of father absence in my humble opinion is that through welfare women did not need a man if she did not want one. Her check would still come whether her babies Daddy hung around or not. This factor plus men shirking their responsibilities and the worst scourge of all abortion have all been the perfect mixture to make folks in inner cities not only dependent but reliable in that the politicians know so long as they keep dolling the people will keep voting. The Great Society veiled in all its promise to rid the country of poverty and make racial equality the forefront of LBJs agenda. In truth he once told a staffer that if he could get his legislation passed he would Have those ni##ers voting democrat for 200 years. It was all by design to keep minorities where he and many of his fellow Democrats exactly wanted them poor and dependent in the cities. Not empowerment to be able to have access to better jobs and a chance at the American dream but in essence to completely re-enslave the inner-city minorities of this nation. One need look no further than the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina to see still how dependent people are on the government. This is the systemic racism that people speak of. Though the media has done its part to fan the flames the politicians have constantly used incidents of crime to weaponize racism against their political foes. The unholy alliance between the media and the left has served to do nothing but bring this nation to a point that I am actually afraid. Post George Floyd which was an amazing opportunity for us to unite but was immediately politicized and the anarchy that followed may never be repaired. Every time I think that we have common ground someone or some group comes in and makes it about racism though the reasons get more and more insane by the day. So much so that AOC recently lectured all of us to remind us that even Climate change is to blame for racism. I keep waiting for Rod Serling to jump out and tell me what I am seeing is not real. So far to date I am still waiting. So what is the solution? I will not cop out and say your guess is as good as mine but in reality its pretty much the truth. I can remember the Black Power movement of my generation with Public Enemy and everyone having their Sista Soljah moment. After the election of a two-term black President I had thought that maybe we were back to a time where race was not the end all be all of human existence. I keep trying to think about legislation that has already been proposed yet every time I turn around our current President is reminding me that I am inherently racist. It is utterly amazing; he knows things about me that I dont even know myself. There must be common ground though. Somewhere out there something must exist that we can all as Americans be proud of and rally behind. I have seen so many great activists try to do that very thing and have had success doing it. People like Starr Parker and the great Candace Owens come to mind. I admire their ability to look critically at the real problems in America today no matter how vile the backlash may be. I do not want to sit at the table with ANTIFA or BLM for that matter. All they do is divide us at every possible turn. I genuinely believe that with grassroots organizing most especially with faith leaders is our only chance to affect a positive change on the Wedge that constantly is hammered to drive us all further and further apart. It pains me to go through social media these days and hear almost a hope for a civil war. I know I do not want that and I believe in my heart that most Americans do not either. I have always tried to teach my children to be color blind. My wife and I must be doing something right because almost without exception my kids best friends are minorities. I truly hope and pray that maybe one day we will again be the American family where everyones opinion is protected. Where we can come together to find solutions to the problems that we have because they are hard and require us all. Our leaders are supposed to be the ones that work to unite us the most. Politics is not a service done out of responsibility so much as opportunity. So long as that is what motivates the majority of legislators nothing will change. Let us not give up though. Just like I believe that we do not need the government intruding into our lives I do not want them intruding in our differences either. The best charity and the best help has always come from citizens acting on their own. We must share this land whether we like it or not is it truly too much to hope that we can share what brings us together. It can happen. We all can affect change in our own lives. We all make the world the way it is and as has been said through history a house divided cannot stand.  The Pamphleteer,political,Facebook

I CANT BREATHE youve already got me in shackles with your knee on my neck and I am begging you to please just let me breathe. When you first approached me with guns drawn I SAID HANDS UP DONT SHOOT I am unarmed and out numbered 4 to 1 but yet you persist in saying I am resisting when its clear I have no fight in me because I CANT BREATHE ! And as I lay on the concrete with three officers holding me down I am already shackled. I ask over and over again please officer I CANT then I suddenly realize I havent enough breath left except to call out MOMMA! I see my mother in spirit form calling for me . Im starting to leave this earthly realm.My heart beat is slowing down and I feel the weight of this world fade away. But wait have I forgotten all those that love me and will be in emotional agony once Ive passed over from this earthly realm? Do I have any unfinished business to take care of? My family and loved ones will they be okay? And as my spirit rises I think I no longer have these options or worries because you became my judge jury and executioner that day. And All because you never saw me as a man you never saw me as a human being you had no care for how many lives you ruined that day. And so I have ascended to a higher plane no more cares of this world. Joy Joy Heavenly Joy .And as I hear my last heart beat I can faintly hear my brothers and sisters pain and outrage and they are saying NO JUSTICE! NO PEACE! POLICE THE POLICE!

Woke  People of color are so vulnerable to violence against us out here in these universal streets. Since weve supposedly come so far you shouldnt expect it to be at the hands of those in squad cars ridin the beat. They come as though with us they already have beef but then wonder why we have no trust when they see that we see their mirror-like transparency.  When the 911 call is dispatched and the description of a black male is heard the cops as robbers respond with hearts of contempt and deceit. See theyve already decided that the black male is a suspect and imminent threat so shoot to kill is the aim and they dont give a damn about trying to hide or be discreet. The fact that he could be a victim never crosses their mind so he doesnt stand a chance against those who think theyre the elite.  Young peoples lives fall unnecessarily and incomplete simply because a cop wants to defeat what was never a challenge for him to even cowardly cheat. Sons end up with bullet holes even when theyre cooperative and silent in the backseat.  White parents dont give it a second thought when their teenage son is stopped by the impartial police. Him getting a ticket is itself the relief or perhaps not being properly belted in the safety of his seat. They have nothing to worry about when their sons and the friendly police meet.  When our sons encounter the heat its an entirely different non-impartial greet. Uniforms roll up in the form of a fleet with guns drawn and their presence is bittersweet because its unknown what theyre intentions may be. Will they steal the life of a future pro athlete; or that of a young brother whose desire is to study pharmacology like they stole the life of E. F. Bradford Jr. a brave young man who served this country as a member of the U.S. Army? Will they shoot because all black males to them are worthless deadbeats? For too many of them it seems to lay down a black man is a satisfying and personal treat.  Those that have sworn to protect can be as hateful as those with the cut out eyes in the flat pale sheet. The way theyve been walking away without any justice it seems the ultimate feat is to make our black men cease to exist  just obsolete. Theyve been able to rely on a crooked system to back their mission with hopes of making it complete. Its all laid out with archives of affidavits of fiction and lies recorded down on memo paper nice and neat.  All the young black lives that mattered were violently and maliciously stolen gunned down or choked to death out on the hardened concrete. They kill us and dont even bother to radio for help. Sometimes a family member arrives just in time to see the last breath from their loved ones fading heartbeat. Too many parents have suffered this unspeakable grief and it is a harsh and painful reality. It can bring us to our knees and make us feel helpless and weak. But maybe someday.......  Maybe someday we will no longer be profiled and targeted by L-E. Maybe someday equality wont be just a fantasy. Maybe someday we too can enjoy that privileged life of entitlement that was likewise our God given right to be free.  Judy Leggett,political,Facebook

"Christmas is fast approaching and we would like to ensure a safe and happy holiday for all.  A number of parents will be purchasing play guns or the iconic Red Ryder B-B-gun that so many kids want or B-B or pellet or paint guns. Some will purchase hunting rifles for those old enough for their first hunt. Whatever it is you choose for your family is exactly that-your choice. We would just like to put forward a few reminders to keep everyone safe.  A toy pistol with or without an identifying red end on the barrel is very difficult to see. Also most kids will remove the end at first chance. A law enforcement officer has to make several split second decisions when encountering anyone with any type of gun. A B-B- gun that resembles a 9mm a B_B_rifle that resembles a AK is extremely difficult to differentiate from toy or weapon from near or far. Todays ""toys"" are very realistic.  It is important to teach your child the basic rules for handling any weapon real or toy. Also teaching your child to obey any command given by a law enforcement officer under any circumstance is vitally important. Our law enforcement officers do not have the luxury of knowing what your child received for Christmas much less if what they are carrying is deadly or a toy.  Please be responsible and safe.",political,Facebook

Why sacrifice public safety to political expediency?  On Tuesday night my opponent as a member of the Hopkins School Board voted to defund their high schools School Resource Officer. Whatever the boards justification at the time or since there is no doubt that their actions have made the students in Hopkins and Minnetonka less safe and added uncertainty at a time when families of school-children are dealing with too much already.  School Resource Officers are an integral part of providing a safe learning environment. They are an important link between the community and our first responders and play a role in letting teachers and administrators focus on their jobs and not outside distractions. But most importantly  and unfortunately  its the job that we hope they never have to do that makes them so important.  Talking about how gun violence is a very real public health threat was a centerpiece of my state legislative campaigns. Nearly alone among my colleagues I spoke out about the need to pass responsible gun control legislation. I want to see fewer guns on the streets and I think there should be more strict background checks in place. But even if all of that were to come to pass tomorrow it wont change the reality that resource officers are necessary to the safety of children in school.  Perhaps as short-sighted as defunding the resource officer position at Hopkins High School has been the rationale repeatedly put forward to justify the decision. Decrying tough budget choices  creating conflict where there neednt be any  and presenting the decision as an either/or proposition between school safety and mental health programs is simply pandering to appease special interests.  For more than 20 years I have worked with mental health advocacy organizations. I have first-hand experience with how mental health issues can affect a family. My campaign has been endorsed by some of our states leading mental health advocates. And during my time in the legislature I authored and testified for bills to increase funding for mental health programs  specifically to reduce teen suicide. Using mental health as the excuse for defunding the school resource officer program reduces the work of mental health advocates to a political slogan and insults the valuable contributions that resource officers make every day in communities across the state.,political,Facebook

Written by Patrick Wilson Des Moines.  I have known Brent and Becky for over 35 years. I went to Drake Law School with Brent and I practiced law and handled countless cases in Tama County.  I have butted heads with Brent many times. Brent doesn't talk loud he doesn't have to. Brent knows the law. I can't tell how many times I argued matters with Brent only to have Brent grab a volume of the Code of Iowa from the bench and point out to me that I was wrong.  Years ago Brent had me appointed as a special prosecutor in a case involving allegations against a local peace officer. At no time ever did Brent suggest to me what the outcome should be. He asked me to do my job and I did. I know that the outcome of my investigation did not make everybody happy but that's the way things go.  When I was fresh out of law school I asked one of the partners in the office where I started my career why we didn't take more cases to trial (we handled criminal defense cases). His response was that we can't keep running to the courthouse and getting beat. You have to pick your cases. Yes Brent cuts deals but so do defense lawyers. You can't win every case. You can't try every case. I have negotiated deals with Brent. When he has been a stickler it's usually because someone was hurt. He sticks to his guns. Yes at times I got pi$$ed at him but at the end of the day you knew where Brent stood. Brent always puts victims first.  You know you have reached the top of the heap when you have earned the respect of your colleagues. Brent Heeren has earned the respect of his colleagues. Brent has my support. 100%. Patrick L.

"Timely Intervention  the Important of Reporting Suspicious Activity and the Need for Red Flag Laws in NC  Today as a result of timely intervention Paul Steber a 19-year-old student attending High Point University in North Carolina was arrested as a result of his plotting and planning to conduct a mass shooting on the universitys campus. Apparently this student had already begun purchasing guns that he planned to use if he was not successful in gaining admission to an on-campus fraternity. He allegedly planned to kill himself and his roommate if his roommate got into the fraternity and he did not. He had bought his weapons within the last week. According to Assistant District Attorney Lori Wickline in Guilford County NC he went as far as studying videos from previous mass shootings so that he could learn what to do and what not to do. Fortunately his suspicious activities were reported to law enforcement.  In a separate and unrelated incident Shayn Striegel a student at the College of Southern Nevada was arrested by campus police on Wednesday after they found a rifle and 2000 rounds of ammunition in his vehicle thanks to a report from someone who allegedly observed ammunition in his vehicle. After Striegels arrest Federico Zaragoza the colleges president released a statement saying ""It is an important reminder of the effectiveness of the 'see something say something' public safety campaign. If you see something suspicious report it to the police immediately."" There could not be more accurate words spoken.  Fortunately in these two cases murders and casualties were avoided thanks to timely intervention. This further supports my belief that we should pass Senate Bill 565 Extreme Risk Protective Orders which is a red flag law that I filed this year in the NC Senate. My primary cosponsors were Senators Jay Chaudhuri and Harper Peterson. We are planning to hold an unofficial public hearing on this bill on September 19 2019 to heighten public awareness relating to the need for timely intervention to remove deadly weapons from those who are planning to use them to harm themselves or others.",political,Facebook
I see today in the media that Americans are increasingly aware that the destruction the virus has wrought in the United States could have been mostly avoided so I am reposting this (updated) in the hopes that even more people will become aware of this fact. Please share this widely. Thank you.  After months of paperwork to get the Lone Liberal Republican Facebook page eligible to promote posts again we are back. I currently live in Thailand and Facebook shut us down last Spring since our page is about American politics originating from a non-U.S. source. I assure you that I bear no resemblance to Vladimir Putin in any way whatsoever...but in any case it's good to be back.  Thailand is a middle income country of around seventy million people. There have been fifty-eight deaths here from the virus and only one local case in the last four months. Life has mostly returned to normal though almost everyone wears a mask temperatures are taken entering malls restaurants parks and stores and hand sanitizer is everywhere.  The resistance in the United States to masks and other steps routinely taken in countries in Asia and Europe to defeat the virus is regarded as insane and shameful to folks here...and in most of the world. And the fact that the resistance is framed in terms of Americans' constitutional rights--rights people in much of the rest of the world wish they had--is a horribly inaccurate framing of our rights.  Who thinks that in times of war drafting Americans to fight is an infringement of our Constitutional rights rather than an obligation of our citizenship? I doubt many of the Americans who refuse to wear masks today would be sympathetic to anyone making such an argument about serving in World War II or Vietnam. And in World War II Americans were drafted to do things like storm beaches with machine guns being fired at them as they did so. Being required to wear a piece of cloth around your mouth and nose is an infringement of your Constitutional rights? (Doing so is not an indication of weakness. It is a show of moral and ethical strength.) Lucky our soldiers in World Wars I and II Korea Vietnam Iraq and Afghanistan (though no American soldiers were drafted in the Afghanistan or Iraq conflicts) were more public minded. And lucky our elected officials didn't turn the other cheek when those few who refused their duty did so. Because the other thing here in Thailand and elsewhere around the world where the virus has been beaten back is the rules are enforced.  We are at war with the virus. The human casualties and devastation to our economy and social fabric are warlike devastation. As of the writing of this post the virus has killed more than 214500 Americans in less than nine months. By contrast 58209 Americans were killed in the Vietnam War between 1961 and 1975. 405399 Americans were killed in World War II in the five years between 1941 and 1945. And any American with a pulse has seen the economic devastation and tearing of our already torn social fabric the virus has wrought.  So it's a war but one that countries from Asia to Europe have shown can be won in a few months of sacrifice. But sacrifice means rules that are uniformly applied and enforced. To date America has been like patients who take half of the antibiotic prescribed and then stop or only remember to take it every other day then complain that they aren't better.  Our political leadership needs to look around the world and get with the program. Thailand's death rate from the virus would have translated to about three hundred deaths given the U.S. population of three hundred and thirty million. What the countries that have defeated the virus have done is not rocket science...certainly the country that put men on the moon more than half a century ago can do this.  Be well thanks for reading and check out the website please. I hope you will find some good ideas there for fixing our broken politics.,political,Facebook
"A CONSPIRACY THEORY D This is part of a series I have been writing on the subject there is much more I am still writing and will post some links in the comments Democrat or Republican we all need to open our our eyes.  Let's try this again. I am afraid to say what is in mind  not really afraid to say it but I fear where we are and where we are going and the future unless we stop and come to our senses quick looks scary.  We have an old tradition in this countrywhen we want to bring freedom and democracy to a foreign land we do one of two things we invade the country topple the regime and find some sellouts to replace the local government or we send arms to some disgruntled faction or two or three to start a civil war let their people destroy the country and we help whoever is the biggest traitor that will sell out the country to us.  The fact is that in a civil war there are no winning sides whoever comes up on top ( a civil war can last generations even) has to make a deal with an outsider or some super rich entity (ies) to maintain power and to establish controls. The super rich are not affected by the war itself in most inst6they may just go outside the war area ( even overseas) and come back later to assume power or control rebuilding effort and thus profit. In modern times the foriegn investment is stopped jobs and industries are lost poverty and misery spreads in all directions and for all sides.  If an entity or a power wanted to destroy the United States of course starting a civil war here would be the best way to destroy the nation its power and economy also. Let us assume that their is a ""cabal"" that is bent on destroying the country and taking control to destroy democracy and and set up autocratic regime todaybwould a good day since we are ready and willing to do it to ourselves. And how convenient if that power was to control parts of the government and the political apparatus already.  The two sides in the country today left and the right are willing to do it the right apparently thinks they have more guns so they will have the upper hand as most of the police and much of the military has already been brainwashed by their side and will be willing to kill for their purpose. They have been convinced that they are on the right side of history and they are sure to win the power. Of course the powers that be  the ones that are aiming to destroy democracy and and ruin the country have already a leader in place to do their bidding to call his followers to arms and to do the dirty work of encouraging civil strife.  More to follow  M. N. R.  12 OCTOBER 2020  CRISIS  An incident or an occasion that causes and brings about a lasting change in a person or even a society. That change once again depends upon the knowledge and the reasoning ability of the person or the society as a whole. The reasoning ability here depends upon education and also upon upbringing nature and nurture as they say. The same instant that will cause one to get motivated and work hard and get an education or such to get ahead could cause another to rob a store join a gang become a hooker or even join a church.  M. N. R.  12 OCTOBER 2020  VICTIMS  Once one has reached majority and claims maturity all choices are deliberate and all consequences always predicted.  If a baby is molested or a child is abused they have no control over the situation but when a person of age abuses alcohol or drugs drives drunk robs or kills drops out of school and has babies they can't afford they are not victims they know what they are doing and should be held responsible.  M. N. R.  That the democracy and the country itself is facing ruin regardless of who wins on the 3rd of November while both sides bicker about the supreme court nomination or the COVID-19 crisis we have bigger issues that need immediate attention. But we have been deliberately mislead. The plan is being worked by both sides to keep the population occupied with trash. I had warned about the militia plans and the infiltration of police and the military. I have written about the BLM and their misguided focus on the police brutality only. If there is a conspiracy it is about keeping the population confused and at each other's throat instead of solving problems. I wrote back in February how COVID-19 will impact everything we know about life from work to education and food  no one is talking about the new realities not in a major way and the public still has no idea what the new world will look like in a couple of years.  While a low level civil war or at least unrest is a real possibility regardless of who wins #republican side is not even trying to promote calm and peace. We will all pay for it. If Trump wins and igive him an 80% chance his followers may go to ""weapons free"" anyway.  Is it the conspiracy of the elite to start a civil war and destroy the democracy and install an autocratic regime. If I were betting I'd say that this the plan. A conspiracy right in your face and you are a willing participant. Only you lose is by winning. I am by no means done here do come back there is a lot more to this  M. N. R. 13 OCTOBER 2020",political,Facebook
"Mark Rutkowski came into his workplace in Pasadena Maryland on August 29th 2019. He was drunk and when told to go home he said he would ""shoot the whole place up"". After the company reported this to police an Extreme Risk Protection Order (ERPO) was issued and when the police served it they found 146 firearms.  Here is how an ERPO works: You become aware that there is someone with guns who is behaving in an obviously dangerous or threatening manner to themselves or others and you call the police to investigate. In an ERPO state the police wont have to wait until a crime has been committed. With probable cause they can seek an expedited civil court order from a judge allowing them to search for and remove the risky persons firearms. Later after the guns are secured a court hearing is held  typically within 14 days  to determine whether it is safe to return the individuals firearms or if not to order that the guns be retained for a limited time. Due process is baked into ERPOs from the beginning and no criminal record is produced at the end. No court has struck down ERPOs (red flag laws) as unconstitutional.  ERPOs are often used by relatives of people who express suicidal thoughts often veterans. If you stand at the top of a building threatening to jump then the fire department tries to save you. If you suffer from suicidal thoughts and plan to kill yourself then society should likewise step in and help you.  Erin Tobin doesn't want common sense gun regulations. I bet if Mark Rutkowski had threatened to shoot up Erin Tobin's workplace then Erin would feel differently.  Erin Tobin is more interested in getting elected than in doing what is best for South Dakota and America. Is that the kind of person you want to represent you in Pierre?",political,Facebook
And In This Corner - Charlie's Soapbox 8/2/19  Politics in the nations capital these days is like a dirty prize fight.  In this corner the Democrats in this corner the Republicans hitting below the belt eye-gouging rabbit punches biting scratching and hitting after the bell will all be allowed there is no round limit and the result- nobody wins.  I watched the last Democrat debate and learned four things:  1. They all despise President Trump. 2. Socialism is alive and well in the Democratic Party. 3. They all think the way to the White House is big government and out-promising the other candidates. 4. Theyve all got their claws out and dont mind destroying anybody who stands in their way fellow Democrats be damned.  If members of the same party are going to declare a no holds barred civil war in the primaries what will the general election be like.  We all know how combative Trump is it seems as if he relishes a good fight and it would appear that this contest will be muddy and bloody with insult hyperbole innuendo and downright animus flying in all directions.  Whoever survives the primaries and faces Trump mano a mano best be prepared to hold their temper and have a lot more arrows in their quiver than just their rabid hatred of a president who if things continue the way they are going will have the best economy and the lowest unemployment numbers in decades to offer up.  Whatever Democrat makes the cut and mounts the debate stage will have to defend the last democratic presidents remarks that manufacturing jobs were gone forever and that America may as well get used to a reduced lifestyle as the new norm.  They have to explain why pointing out the abject failures in Elijah Cummings congressional district is racist.  When black and Hispanic unemployment are at an all-time low its hard to prove that the president in power is a racist.  The hardest part of the Democratic pipe dreams to defend will be the Green New Deal and if Trump does his fiscal homework as Im sure he will and points out the cost and impossibly of this Alice in Wonderland monstrosity it could be a sticky wicket indeed.  Now Im not saying that the Democratic candidate wont come out swinging and as we all know the selection of the people asking the questions has a lot to do with a level playing field but be that as it will its going to be a long and exhausting night for somebody.  Cookie Ocasio-Cortez and the Odd Squad are the darlings of the American Media and bane of semi-sensible Democrats everywhere have done a lot to raise the temperature of politics in both parties and one has to wonder how long Nancy Pelosi can keep the pressure cap screwed down tight enough to prevent the impeachment crowd from storming the gates and seizing control of if not the gavel at least the agenda of the House of Representatives.  From what I gathered last night there are as many health care plans as there are candidates and they are all about as transparent as the Swamp water (pun intended).  There is a clandestine civil war going on in the Democratic Party as the unabashed socialists and radical young guns although few in number loom large on all the major network and cable news outlets and no radio talk show can make it through a broadcast cycle without reporting on their antics which the Democratic leadership seems at a loss to deal with.  The Republican Party also has its share of rifts and rants and even a few Never Trumpers who had rather see their party fold than be led by a non-pedigreed renegade who refuses to join the old boys club and do things the way theyve always been done in Washington.  Its a volatile and combative seventeen months we are getting ready to go through between now and election time.  October surprises will be coming at us months early and in record numbers and with a biased media we will be forced to separate the grain from the chaff.  We will hear ridiculous accusations raging and unreasonable anger and enough rumors to cause Lake Pontchartrain to overflow.  We will question the neutrality of some of our government agencies doubt the honesty of our media the sincerity - and perhaps even the sanity - of some of our candidates and when its over regardless of how it goes there will be those who will say it was rigged by loyalists or interfered with by foreign powers.  Whichever side youre on tighten your cinch strap make sure both feet are in the stirrups pull up the keep on your stampede string and get ready for the ride of your life.  What do you think?

A Q&A from a town's paper in my district... some of the questions are a bit leftist. But no worries... I read right through them. lol Check it out...     UNITED STATES CONGRESS: HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: DISTRICT 13  Candidate name: Monique Worthy Party Affiliation: Republican  Have you been elected to any office in the past? NO  Do you have a military background? NO  Why do you want to work in Congress? To actually FIGHT for what we as Republicans believe in. To stand up and actually FIGHT against democrats. To cut spending cut taxes stop abortions get rid of some agencies and departments stand with my president. And to show our district what they have been missing in their Republican politicians. That being a REAL Republican fighter.  Do you support the foreign assistance budget? NO. (with certain exceptionsNONE of which includes nations that chant death to America or nations that dont hold our best interest)  What do you see as the U.S. role in combating human trafficking? If folks are trafficking here lock em up and throw away the keys. We cant control what goes on in other countries.  What are your thoughts on fixing our nation's healthcare system? Sending healthcare to the states. 50 different options will undoubtedly make things a hell of a lot better.  What would you do to support education at the federal level? I wouldnt. I believe the federal government has no place in education. That is for state and local governments as well as parents to decide.  What will you do to support a vibrant economy for this district's rural areas? Fight to keep what we have and fight to court more businesses. Making Rural America Great Again by helping to keep taxes low and no burdensome Government intrusion.  How will you increase job opportunities for your constituents? Fighting to keep policies that the President is enacting and pushing to help enact those that need congressional approval. And just remember The government doesnt create or increase job opportunities. They can make the economic climate less burdensome and let the markets increase job opportunities. The less government you have the more opportunities for jobs you have.  What if any steps should be taken to reform immigration policies? 1 Electing REAL Conservative Republicans with clear majorities in both houses. 2 Elect Donald J Trump again. 3 Begin the Reform process.  In light of escalating threats from North Korea Iran and elsewhere what measures do you support to address our national security? Continue to beef up our military. Strong defenses deter aggression. Weak defenses attract aggression. In the event that you have a strong defense And they still come for you Well you turn them to dust. Problem solved. That will let the rest of the world know that we dont seek confrontation but If forced into any we will emerge victorious. Completely.  What should the federal government do to secure elections and voting in our country? Make it ILLEGAL for ILLEGAL aliens to vote in ANY U.S. election whether federal state or locally. Enact voter I.D. laws. Use paper ballots and computer ballots. Not one or the other. BUT BOTH.  Please explain why you do or do not think it is important to reduce the role of money in American elections: It is NOT important. For those who cant work for someones campaign volunteer for their campaign or vote for the candidate People should be able to express their support however they want to. Money is a form of that expression of speech. Youre infringing on someones free Speech when you limit what they can/cant donate in any election. (most people dont understand that most Republicans WORK so unlike the democrats We dont have the time to volunteer phone bank etc for campaigns we support so we choose to support with money instead)  If elected will you support your party's leader whether it be President Trump or House Minority Leader Pelosi? Why would I not? I agree with President Trump on just about everything.  Do you think the Second Amendment should be repealed? (I had to read this a couple of times just to make sure I read it correctly) Let me guess this is a democrat area? Who in their right mind would want the 2nd amendment repealed? And leave guns with only criminals And the government? I think NOT.  What should Congress do to ensure Social Security's long-term future? Stop raiding it to pay for other programs Leave it alone. Leave it for what it was intended to do. Social Security is drawn from folks checks for when they are unable to work After working for so long and paying into it. The government has morphed it into EVERYTHING it was NOT intended to be. Take it back to its origin.  Is there a way to reduce the impact entitlements have on the federal budget? Yes Send the so-called entitlements to the states where they belong. Let them figure it out.  Do you support term limits? Yes.  What additional information do you want voters to know about you? Im not your typical Republican. Im an ACTUAL Republican. I actually know how to keep the Republic a Republic. That is why I AM a Republican.,political,Facebook

It's time to treat guns like the public threat that they are:  In Virginia I pay personal property tax to my local government on my cars. When I had a trailer I paid taxes on that too. Law abiding gun owners like me are tired of watching gun laws abused and innocent people slaughtered.  Let's start with all firearms that can hold more than five rounds of ammunition. This won't impact hunters (at least not the good ones. If you need more than five rounds to harvest an animal then maybe you should just stick to video games.)  With all 140 seats up for grabs this year in Virginia it's time for Richmond to force localities to tax firearms as personal property and Richmond must set a minimum rate that local governments must charge.  The money raised can go directly Virginia veterans who are suffering from PTSD and other service related medical issues.

More Than 60% of Voters in the State of Washington Approve New Firearm Regulations  So often there is little political will among politicians to approve measures to regulate firearms however recently when this decision was left to the voters of the State of Washington more than 60% approved new gun regulations. The new law approved by voters would do the following:  - It would raise the age from 18-21 for a person buying a semi-automatic rifle. In addition a person wanting to buy a firearm would have to pass an enhanced background check show proof that they had taken a firearms training course and the buyer would have to wait 10 days before he or she could take possession.  - The law also creates new gross misdemeanor and felony classes of a crime known as community endangerment. The law does not require firearm owners to lock away their guns however an owner could be charged under one of the new community endangerment crimes if someone not allowed to have access to a firearm such as a child or a felon were to get a hold of it display it publicly cause it to discharge or if it is used in a crime. Gun owners who keep their guns secure by using trigger locks gun safes or lock boxes would not be subject to these crimes if somehow a person was able to obtain and misuse their weapons.  This law will go into effect January 1st 2019 and it is the third in a series of ballot measures sponsored by the Alliance for Gun Responsibility in response to the mass shootings that have occurred nationwide. In light of all of the controversy that has accompanied proposed firearms regulations I thought that the approach taken and approved by more than 60% of the voters in the State of Washington provided interesting food for thought.,political,Facebook
The biggest problem in this nation right now is division. We have to stop dividing every important issue into two sides. We are an unhappy nation. We are a gridlocked nation. The gridlock endangers us ALL. It means we don't fix health care or feed hungry children take care of our veterans fix roads and bridges or stop the opioid crisis. There are really tough issues that divide us like abortion guns immigration and even the President (not just the current President). As tough as these issues are we have to stop taking sides against one another. This nation needs us ALL OF US more than anything to come together. We must find a way to break the gridlock...before it is too late. We must find ways to approach even the toughest of issues...in ways that BOTH uphold our values AND enable us to work together and move forward. It begins when we treat one another with respect and common decency and when we commit to the highest ethical standards. TOGETHER WE STAND.,political,Facebook
Campaign Platform of Tony Martinez (Antonio C. Martinez II) Democratic Primary Candidate for State Senator 38th District  Version 4.0  The context of my campaign is called #ReconnectNY. The 38th District is a regional bridge in the Hudson valley between Upstate New York and New York City. There are four core contexts that form the basis of the policies that I will fight for in the New York State Senate Competition Literacy Value and Gratitude. I want government to work for all the people.  Taking on Hate in New York. In view of the horrific events of December 2019 in Monsey and the ongoing problem of Anti-Semitism Racism White Nationalism that is plaguing our state and nation we have to tackle this problem with a 360-degree approach.  We must forcefully punish hate crimes and call it what it is Domestic Terrorism. The goal of those who hate is to terrorize their victims and destroy them. We need to train law enforcement and coordinate local state and federal law enforcement to take action against individuals and groups that promote hatred. The State Senate and Assembly should conduct joint public hearings across the states to shed light on this problem so that it can legislate more effective legislation to combat hate crimes.  We must educate our youth and the public in memory of the victims of hate and make never again be our rallying cry. This means looking at our school curriculums and making sure our kids know the history of hatred and racism and learn how it is fought and how we can fight it in our communities.  There must be adequate funding for security at houses of worship and coordination with local law enforcement for regular patrolling and community interaction.  We must publicly honor those who fight against hatred and celebrate their courage to empower others to do the same. The fight against hatred begins at home at our houses of worship and all public places.  1. Competition  I will support economic policies that promote fair competition. This is the best way to promote creativity and innovation and lower costs for consumers. I am opposed to monopolies and oligopolies because they are anti-competitive and are bad for markets workers competitors consumers. This means policies that are open to new market entrants that favor equal opportunity but not equal outcomes. Regulations must serve society not erect barriers to entry. I support labor being granted shares of business so that labor can be owners of capital. I want to discourage stock share buybacks. Competitive markets help reduce unjust inequality and promote entrepreneurial activity.  2. Taxes  I am not inclined to support tax increases. There must be an honest value-oriented conversation with the people to have them understand what they are getting for their tax dollars and gain their consent before any tax increase. In the alternative when services must be cut a similar conversation must be had with the people. We must always be in an accountable conversation where we can answer what is the value that we are getting for our tax dollars.  3. Literacy  I believe policies and reforms in the following areas that will promote and empower our citizens with the tools to be critical thinkers and mindful to make better decisions for themselves in every aspect of their daily life:  A. Financial Literacy  I want to promote financial intelligence in High School by teaching Home Economics again; Credit and Money Management; Insurance. We want to encourage savings and investment.  B. Civic Literacy  I want to empower immigrants in our state to learn English and American Civics through low-cost courses through the SUNY/CUNY and Community College System We all benefit by being multilingual and cognizant how our government works. Similarly I will support the re-establishment of the requirement for our high school kids to learn and be proficient in a foreign language upon graduation.  C. Health/Nutrition/Food Literacy  I support reforming Medical School Education and Licensure requirements to make Physicians learn clinical therapeutic and metabolic nutrition in their practices. Similarly we want programs to teach our kids about the food we eat and where it comes from. We should be teaching cooking and food preparation again in school. I support expanding farmers markets to the supermarket by requiring supermarkets to dedicate space where consumers can purchase locally grown produce dairy and meats from New York or locally sourced within a 300-mile radius of the store. This will strengthen and help our family farms in New York.  4. Diabetes  I will work to bring down the costs of this terrible disease through nutrition and exercise. As a survivor of a heart attack and Type 2 Diabetes in remission now for 5.5 years and savings of over $24K in prescription drug costs I do not need anymore this can be replicated creating millions in savings in Medicaid and for Health Insurers in our state. Our district is blessed to have doctors and facilities that can be demonstration projects.  5. Heart disease  I will support insurance coverage of Coronary Arterial Calcification scans so that people can actually find out if where and how much plaque they have in their arteries. This is a far superior test that averages $100 in cost yet is not currently covered by insurance.  6. Health Insurance  while I support the concept of universal coverage for all New Yorkers it is critical that whatever reforms are made that competitive and accountable mechanisms are built into the system otherwise healthcare will be stale and abused. I will introduce into the debate a discussion where we create a single risk pool and require insurance companies to  compete for access to that pool by offering plans and coverage people need and put the bargaining power back in the hands of the consumer side of health care. It is time to allow health and wellness to compete against sickness. Mental health must be added to the core complement of services offered under any insurance plan.  7. Physical Health Credits I support a tax incentive to use gyms. The sales of mattresses should be tax-free as sleep like food is essential to everyones health.  8. Pet Adoption Credit I support a tax incentive for citizens to adopt shelter dogs and cats from NY county shelters or accredited pet shelters in the states.  9. Environment - New York State must be a leader in environmental conservation. I will always prioritize ensuring our water is safe to drink our air is clean and we are aggressively combating climate change before it is too late. We should promote environmental literacy in schools and incentivize citizens to make the transition to environmentally smart products.  10. Criminal Justice  I will monitor the newly implemented bail reform law to prevent abuse and work with our police and courts to prevent abuse of this system. I do not believe in private prisons. True criminal justice must have four components in most cases. They are Retribution Rehabilitation Reconciliation and Redemption. I will be looking at the Penal code and Criminal Procedure Law to make reforms to create improvements.  11. Reducing Drinking and Driving DWIs  We have too many DWIs in our region. I will propose a new requirement for all first time Drivers licensees to attend a mandatory Mothers Against Drunk Driving class or attend an actual DWI arraignment and judicial proceeding in the courts to help educate and deter DWI. I will also propose that the penalties and warnings for DWIs be conspicuously posted at bars and where alcoholic beverages are served and taxi services be presented.  12. Estate Reform  I will propose legislation to bar Court-appointed guardians who are not related to their wards from being beneficiaries of their wills.  13. Gun Safety  I support the right of our law-abiding citizens to protect themselves with a firearm. I support gun safety education for all gun owners. I also support all efforts to prevent mentally ill or criminal convicts from being able to get guns.  14. Marijuana  I support the full legalization and regulation of Marijuana. All vices should be controlled and regulated by the government instead of organized crime. Revenues should be used for healthcare addiction treatment and research on addiction.  15. Ethics and Term Limits  We spend too much time and money on politics instead of governance. We need to have a robust discussion and dialogue about this issue. I propose amending the State Constitution to change the terms of office of the State Senate and State Assembly from Two Years to Four Years provided that no one may serve more than three Four Year terms in each House for a maximum of Twelve Years in each House. I also propose  amending the State Constitution to impose a term limit of 3 Four Year terms in the Office of Governor.  16. Public Financing of Elections  In principle I support this idea and we should examine how we can make it easier for citizens to participate and run for office. Competition will lead to better ideas and proposals and level the playing field for candidates who are not independently wealthy.,political,Facebook
"Brilliantly written by Lori Gallagher Witt. (This pretty much describes what most Liberals think and practice....)  Please read this especially if your first inclination is not to read it. I really appreciate it.  I'm a liberal but that doesn't mean what a lot of you apparently think it does. Let's break it down shall we? Because quite frankly I'm getting a little tired of being told what I believe and what I stand for. Spoiler alert: not every liberal is the same though the majority of liberals I know think along roughly these same lines:  1. I believe a country should take care of its weakest members. A country cannot call itself civilized when its children disabled sick and elderly are neglected. PERIOD.  2. I believe healthcare is a right not a privilege. Somehow that's interpreted as ""I believe Obamacare is the end-all be-all."" This is not the case. I'm fully aware that the ACA has problems that a national healthcare system would require everyone to chip in and that it's impossible to create one that is devoid of flaws but I have yet to hear an argument against it that makes ""let people die because they can't afford healthcare"" a better alternative. I believe healthcare should be far cheaper than it is and that everyone should have access to it. And no I'm not opposed to paying higher taxes in the name of making that happen.  3. I believe education should be affordable. It doesn't necessarily have to be free (though it works in other countries so I'm mystified as to why it can't work in the US) but at the end of the day there is no excuse for students graduating college saddled with five- or six-figure debt.  4. I don't believe your money should be taken from you and given to people who don't want to work. I have literally never encountered anyone who believes this. Ever. I just have a massive moral problem with a society where a handful of people can possess the majority of the wealth while there are people literally starving to death freezing to death or dying because they can't afford to go to the doctor. Fair wages lower housing costs universal healthcare affordable education and the wealthy actually paying their share would go a long way toward alleviating this. Somehow believing that makes me a communist.  5. I don't throw around ""I'm willing to pay higher taxes"" lightly. If I'm suggesting something that involves paying more well it's because I'm fine with paying my share as long as it's actually going to something besides lining corporate pockets or bombing other countries while Americans die without healthcare.  6. I believe companies should be required to pay their employees a decent livable wage. Somehow this is always interpreted as me wanting burger flippers to be able to afford a penthouse apartment and a Mercedes. What it actually means is that no one should have to work three full-time jobs just to keep their head above water. Restaurant servers should not have to rely on tips multibillion-dollar companies should not have employees on food stamps workers shouldn't have to work themselves into the ground just to barely make ends meet and minimum wage should be enough for someone to work 40 hours and live.  7. I am not anti-Christian. I have no desire to stop Christians from being Christians to close churches to ban the Bible to forbid prayer in school etc. (BTW prayer in school is NOT illegal; *compulsory* prayer in school is - and should be - illegal). All I ask is that Christians recognize *my* right to live according to *my* beliefs. When I get pissed off that a politician is trying to legislate Scripture into law I'm not ""offended by Christianity"" -- I'm offended that you're trying to force me to live by your religion's rules. You know how you get really upset at the thought of Muslims imposing Sharia law on you? That's how I feel about Christians trying to impose biblical law on me. Be a Christian. Do your thing. Just don't force it on me or mine.  8. I don't believe LGBT people should have more rights than you. I just believe they should have the *same* rights as you.  9. I don't believe illegal immigrants should come to America and have the world at their feet especially since THIS ISN'T WHAT THEY DO (spoiler: undocumented immigrants are ineligible for all those programs they're supposed to be abusing and if they're ""stealing"" your job it's because your employer is hiring illegally). I believe there are far more humane ways to handle undocumented immigration than our current practices (i.e. detaining children splitting up families ending DACA etc).  10. I don't believe the government should regulate everything but since greed is such a driving force in our country we NEED regulations to prevent cut corners environmental destruction tainted food/water unsafe materials in consumable goods or medical equipment etc. It's not that I want the government's hands in everything -- I just don't trust people trying to make money to ensure that their products/practices/etc. are actually SAFE. Is the government devoid of shadiness? Of course not. But with those regulations in place consumers have recourse if they're harmed and companies are liable for medical bills environmental cleanup etc. Just kind of seems like common sense when the alternative to government regulation is letting companies bring their bottom line into the equation.  11. I believe our current administration is fascist. Not because I dislike them or because I cant get over an election but because I've spent too many years reading and learning about the Third Reich to miss the similarities. Not because any administration I dislike must be Nazis but because things are actually mirroring authoritarian and fascist regimes of the past.  12. I believe the systemic racism and misogyny in our society is much worse than many people think and desperately needs to be addressed. Which means those with privilege -- white straight male economic etc. -- need to start listening even if you don't like what you're hearing so we can start dismantling everything that's causing people to be marginalized.  13. I am not interested in coming after your blessed guns nor is anyone serving in government. What I am interested in is the enforcement of present laws and enacting new common sense gun regulations. Got another opinion? Put it on your page not mine.  14. I believe in so-called political correctness. I prefer to think its social politeness. If I call you Chuck and you say you prefer to be called Charles Ill call you Charles. Its the polite thing to do. Not because everyone is a delicate snowflake but because as Maya Angelou put it when we know better we do better. When someone tells you that a term or phrase is more accurate/less hurtful than the one you're using you now know better. So why not do better? How does it hurt you to NOT hurt another person?  15. I believe in funding sustainable energy including offering education to people currently working in coal or oil so they can change jobs. There are too many sustainable options available for us to continue with coal and oil. Sorry billionaires. Maybe try investing in something else.  16. I believe that women should not be treated as a separate class of human. They should be paid the same as men who do the same work should have the same rights as men and should be free from abuse. Why on earth shouldnt they be?  I think that about covers it. Bottom line is that I'm a liberal because I think we should take care of each other. That doesn't mean you should work 80 hours a week so your lazy neighbor can get all your money. It just means I don't believe there is any scenario in which preventable suffering is an acceptable outcome as long as money is saved.  Copy & paste if you want.",political,Facebook
"I condemn terrorism of any kind! It doesn't matter the race or the religion of the terrorist. Unfortunately the Wolverine Watchman group of terrorists set up their training camp on the same dirt road as my grandma's house in the Luther area. It is hard to consider a group of men with the goal of kidnapping our governor and overthrowing our state government with groups of giggling cousins exploring the vast woods behind Grandma's house.  We would climb the rolling hills explore the woods and pick the wild flowers along the way (it was a long time ago we were kids). If we were doing the same thing in the months leading up to these despicable men's arrest would we have heard the guns as they relentlessly fired into the peace and tranquility of the only place on earth that could bring the same comfort as the words ""Grandma's House""?  Even more incomprehensible than the terrorists themselves is the idea that there are politicians including Donald Trump that aren't calling out these men for what they are. Referring to them as a militia gives a bad name to the militias. It saddens me that as I type this there are those who will see this as a negative in my efforts to win my election.

In case you missed my first position paper: OPIOID EPIDEMIC  Today I am releasing the first of many position papers I will be issuing during the course of my campaign for the 3rd Congressional seat in New Mexico. It is my firm belief that voters not only need to know where their elected officials stand on the important issues of the day but also their underlying reasons.  The opioid epidemic is one of the most compelling issues facing our country today yet it is an issue that has received little attention and even less action on the part of our public officials.  When I first ran for First Judicial District Attorney of Santa Fe I made the opioid crisis in our community the central focus of my campaign. I pledgedand continue to pledgeto work tirelessly to treat non-violent drug offenders with a treatment-oriented approach to our deeply entrenched drug problem. As a progressive prosecutor I promoted the Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion Program that was already in place which focuses on treatment and diversion and was part of the community collective that helped expand the program to Rio Arriba County. The problems we face with drug intervention is so massive the only way we can solve it is by developing a partnership with the federal government and local care givers. It is one of the reasons why I have decided to run for Congressto become a fierce advocate in Washington D.C. for Northern New Mexico.  Fact: the opioid epidemic is the deadliest drug-overdoes crisis in US history. Since the crisis began in the late 1990's more than 700000 people have died from drug overdoses which is about as many people who live in the 3rd Congressional district. The opioid epidemic has killed more Americans than guns or car accidents and is doing so at a pace faster than the H.I.V. epidemic did at its peak. At a rate of 175 deaths a day the total number of opioid deaths now exceeds the number of Americans killed during the Vietnam war.  It saddens me that over the last decade our state has been either No.1 or No. 2 in the nation for drug overdose death rates. In 2017 there were 332 overdose deaths involving opioids in New Mexicoa rate of 16.7 deaths per 100000 persons compared to the average national rate of 14.6 deaths per 100000 persons. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse prescription opioids were involved in most deaths in 2017 with 171 followed by heroin with 144 and synthetic opioids other than methadone with 75 deaths. Roughly half of our state's counties have an overdose death rate higher than the national average of 21.7.  In the latest ranking New Mexico ranks 17th in the nation for drug overdose deaths with a rate of 24.6 deaths per 100000 people in 2017. Rio Arriba County leads the state in such deaths with a rate nearly four times the state and national averages.  Lastly in 2017 the New Mexico Department of Health reported that NOWS (neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome) has increased 324% from 3.3 cases per 1000 live births to 14.0 cases per 1000 live births. While Hispanics accounted for the highest proportion of cases (48%) the highest increase occurred among American Indians/Alaska Natives with 698%.  Not only are we losing our family and friends to this epidemic we are losing funds that could go to education and infrastructure. It is estimated that the opioid epidemic is costing the nation billions of dollars in economic burden. President Trumps White House Council of Economic Advisors estimated that the opioid epidemic has cost the country over $500 billion in 2015 alone. It is one of the principle reasons why we have the largest prison population on the face of the planet.  In October 2017 the Trump administration declared a public health emergency over the opioid epidemic. The Trump administration focus was on building a wall to stop the flow of illicit opioids like heroin and fentanyl. This did little since most illegal drugs come from ports of entry. In addition the Trump administration has tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act which would deny health benefits for treatment from hundreds of thousands of people with opioid addiction. I firmly believe the White House has failed in their primary mission to protect the citizens of the United States from this type of emergency!  To fight the opioid epidemic I support the CARE ACT that Senator Warren and Representative Elijah Cummings introduced in Congress that would allocate $100 billion over 10 years to fight the opioid epidemic. I also support more research into alternative painkillers including medical marijuana. I support the CARE ACT because it has a comprehensive approach to solving the opioid epidemic. Money would be appropriated to go into funding innovative treatment models and necessary research surveillance and training of health care staff. It would also support needle exchanges and other harm reduction services so long as there is evidence that a program would reduce overdose deaths and do not violate the law.  The only way to solve this problem is to act as we did to fight the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Instead of a piecemeal approach we need a bold comprehensive approach much as we did when Congress passed the Ryan White Care Act two decades ago. Unfortunately the Warren/Cummings bill has not moved far in Congress. When elected to Congress I pledge to lead the fight for passage of the Warren/Cummings bill or some version thereof!  There are other things we can do to solve the opioid crisis in our state. I support medical marijuana laws as well as the expungement of the records of those arrested solely for possession of marijuana.  I will lead the effort to limit or virtually eliminate the use of prescription painkillers in emergency rooms and instead treat pain using alternative methods. Notably this effort has been highlighted by St. Josephs Hospital in NJ where they have virtually eliminated prescription pain killers form their emergency department.  I agree with Senator Corey Booker that pharmaceutical companies should be held criminally liable for playing a role in the nation's opioid crisis. In addition I strongly support the almost 2000 communities that have sued large pharmaceutical companies who have flooded their communities with opioids.  This position paper is the first of many that I will be making public during the course of my Congressional campaign. I believe that voters need to know exactly where their elected officials stand on the issues that will affect their lives. Please feel free to comment and provide other constructive ideas on how we can work together to solve this crisis.  Many Thanks  Marco Serna Candidate for Congress District 3 NM,political,Facebook
We have drawn 3 names out of the hat! The winners for our May 2021 are: Santa Fe Watershed - To protect and restore the health and vibrancy of the Santa Fe River and it's watershed for the benefit of people and the environment. They achieve this through education restoration stewardship and advocacy. They honor the connection of people and the watershed. The funds would be used to educate middle and high school students. They would be taught the scientific protocols to monitor water quality in the upper watershed and photo monitor and record the results. The funds are needed to rent busses to take the kids to the site. They will also be constructing a Rain Garden on school grounds. Working with Santa Fe middle and high school students student monitoring occurs at a study site between Nichols and McClure Reservoirs in the Upper Watershed. Each class is provided with a pre-visit to the classroom to map out the Santa Fe River Watershed and introduce field collection techniques. During a field trip to the Upper Watershed students collect data including water quality variables benthic macroinvertebrates and canopy cover. Data is summarized interpreted and made available to local decision makers. New Mexicans To Prevent Gun Violence - To reduce firearm injury and death through public health education advocacy and public awareness in order to protect the safety of our families and communities. The funds from 100 Women Who Care would be used to create the Groceries for Guns buybacks in Santa Fe. Our Groceries for Guns buybacks gets food on tables and unwanted guns out of homes. We give grocery gift cards in exchange for the gun. (Our last gun buyback in Santa Fe in 2020 took in 192 firearms with over 40% being semi-automatic handguns and semi-automatic rifles. We also give out art supplies for students to do Student Pledge Against Gun Violence events at their schools. YouthWorks - Providing over 150000 hot meals to children youth families and community members experiencing homelessness since the state shutdown in March 2020.

"The NRA: The Unauthorized History will be released 4 weeks from today (3/31) by Flatiron.

This is a must-read for anyone interested in guns American politics or the daily tragedy of gun violence."" Adam Winkler author of Gunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America  ""This is the book for anyone who has ever wondered why the United States is incapable of even minor regulation of firearms despite alarming levels of gun violence and consistent broad public support for it. Frank Smyth has delivered a clearly-written diligently-researched and level-headed answer. He documents how the NRA once primarily a sporting group that advocated sensible gun controls has buried its past rewritten history and transformed itself into an enormously influential right-wing force that has elevated gun fetishism into a political ideology that for many borders on religion."" Mark Bowden journalist and author of Black Hawk Down and Killing Pablo  ""Lucid and riveting Frank Smyth's The NRA tracks the NRA back to the 1870s when its civic-minded founders promoted rifle practice shooting matches and gun safety. Always compelling and full of surprises!""

On Mass  School Shootings  Recently the New Orleans Mayor said ending violence will not be easy or quick. It's generational! She is right and we must start now. Fundamentally Its values. We do not value life as we used to. It isn't a simple solution or set of events that drive a person to mass violence at a school shopping mall or place of worship. But research does indicate common characteristics of those who have committed these acts. We need to eliminate and address these characteristics.  There is a high probability that people who do these shootings have been subjected to or seen violence when they are young. We need to care for our children when they are very young. We need to protect and care for children who may be in households where there is physical and emotional abuse. We need to be vigilant for violence in the community and at school such as bullying. We need ways to identify those children and families at risk and provide support when needed so we don't end with the damaged children and adults. This cuts across all races ethnicities and income levels. If we don't address this we will end up with damaged teens and adults.  Each of them has suffered a personal crisis. We need to be sure people can handle and adapt to those personal crises we all experience. Whether its personal rejection discipline from a parent or employer or losing a job our children need to be raised to be resilient so they can withstand these personal setbacks. All people need support networks to help them through these times. Whether the support is from their family or faith or a social support system people need to be able to handle these personal crises.  Finally for some reason these people damaged from experiencing childhood violence and suffering a personal crisis to often come up with a plan giving them satisfaction by committing the despicable act of violence. They have an idea access to the tools so they can carry out their plan and a susceptible/easy target. We cannot change the way people think but we must secure the tools they can use. And when it is reasonable we need to defend what may be easy or soft targets. I do not want to live in a police state that searches everyone when entering a building. I don't want to live in a country where everyone is always on camera. I treasure my privacy. We could quickly lose our freedom. If we ban the tools (guns) most have used we likewise will be losing our freedom.  The answer is not easy or quick. Its generational! We need to eliminate children suffering or seeing violence when they are young and most impressionable. We need to detect and support those having a personal crisis. We need to do these things so we dont have broken people going through life. And we need to harden targets where we can and must keep guns and other weapons out of the hands of those who should not have them. That is our challenge and our responsibility.  If this makes sense to you. Please follow this page and like this site so you will see my upcoming posts on issues facing our nation and the 20th Congressional District. Please engage in this discussion. We will all learn. I ask that you be respectful and remember everyone is entitled to their point of view.

I just...cant.  Im bone weary.  I dont want to make one more phone call...knock on one more door...or implore one more person to pull their head out of the ground and act before it is too late.  I just want to laugh again. Not all the time...but a lot.  I dont want to hear of one more mass murder of innocents because guns hatred fear and anger proliferate our society.  Im tired of pushing so hard to make a point in the hope that somewhere...somehow...it will make a difference in opening shuttered eyes and ears and shake someone...somewhere into consciousness.  I dont mind hard work. I worked hard my entire life. I dont begrudge those who parlayed their hard work into wealth. They deserved to reap the rewards of their efforts.  But couldnt they just open their wallets a bit wider to help those who just couldnt seem to make it happen? Couldnt they show just a bit more compassion towards their fellow human beings?  Im tired.  Wouldnt it be great to wake up tomorrow morning and have someone tell us that it was all some type of mass hallucination...a nightmare that overtook us because we had become too complacent?

Walmart to End Handgun and Assault Weapons Ammunition Sales a Step in the Right Direction  Walmart recently announced that it will no longer sell ammunition for handguns or assault weapons in its stores and that they would ask customers not to carry guns into any of their stores in the United States. This decision occurred in the aftermath of the horrific shooting at a Walmart in El Paso Texas where 22 people were killed and 24 were injured and I commend Walmart for this decision. One thing that was brought to my attention by a constituent recently was that between June 1st of this year and August 11th there were allegedly 40 separate incidences related to the use of firearms or other weapons on the premises of Walmart stores here in the United States. I was provided with a list of the stores and the dates of the incidences; however Ive not gone back to double-check the accuracy of the document. That being said I dont have any reason to believe that that document is inaccurate. Walmart is taking a step in the right direction and I would like nothing more than to see other businesses do the same.,political,Facebook
Dear Lincoln County Resident  It seems STR Property Manager's facts need clarification. Example: STRs contribute large amounts of dollars to the Lincoln County economy.  Tourist dollars from STRs in unincorporated Lincoln County may be realized by some grocery and outlet stores but most vacationers arrive with coolers boxes and bags of food with many children.  They eat at the house walk neighborhoods access beaches and do not go to bars restaurants and tourist shops.  STRs say they contribute $11.7million in taxes however the countys 2020 budget has $1.225 from room tax. Total taxes expected from all county homes is $24m.  It is IMPOSSIBLE that 566 STR houses contribute half of the entire countys tax revenue.  Also claiming STRs contribute to county employment totaling $192 Million annually for 3600 employed. (3600 for 566 houses?) That would give a median annual wage of $53000.00 to each employee!  Housekeepers average $15/hr or $30000.00/year; a significant difference. And housekeepers report having no benefits.  Consider this fact. STR owners dont live here  Reportedly 94% of STR owners live out of the area out of state even out of the USA. The result is profits go out of the County.  Local voluntarism charity dollars and contributions such as backpack programs dont come from STR owners nor renters. Instead its local residents' support for such things.  Additionally STRs lower local census which lessens state and federal dollars coming to the County.  STRs say they support local maintenance repair commercial industries. Those houses would require the same attention but not be tax-deductible!  STR owners claim they and their renters comply with regulations. Owners are not present to witness nor manage renters' behaviors like noise garbage illegal fireworks illegal parking trespassing peeping into windows speeding cars on single-lane unincorporated residential areas stolen firewood dog poop and more.  County enforcement is through Sheriff's department with enforcement left to residential homeowners to call in complaints. Sheriff department citations are limited to criminal/civil laws needing to be witnessed with no mechanism for writing a ticket if identified.  Owners say there are no reported problems however county reporting and enforcement are not sufficient for the 566 homes from Yachts to Lincoln City!  Recent witnessing of vacationers wearing their guns while walking residential neighborhoods questions why are STRs good for Unincorporated Residential Lincoln County. Does an incident have to happen before action is done?  How do authorities prepare for the next emergency when an additional 140 people per 600 feet are vacationing in these small neighborhoods?  Where could vacationers go? Hotels motels resorts or zoned tourist housing zones with appropriate emergency preparedness and onsite management.  Want a voice in this matter?

On my first tour to Germany there was a book sold in the PX showing how an American soldier should behave in Germany on the first page it said ""Don't act like an American"" I am an American I act like an American and I am proud of it I am just like you. In one of the most memorable lines ever from our movies there is one oft quoted line Colonel Jessup said ""you can't handle the truth"" the line is from the movie ""A few good men"" most of can't handle the truth but that is not the whole thing read  Son we live in a world that has walls and those walls have to be guarded by men with guns.

You don't want the truth because deep down in places you don't talk about at parties you want me on that wall -- you need me on that wall.  We use words like ""honor"" ""code"" ""loyalty."" We use these words as the backbone of a life spent defending something. You use them as a punch line.  I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very freedom that I provide and then questions the manner in which I provide it.  I would rather that you just said ""thank you"" and went on your way. Otherwise I suggest you pick up a weapon and stand the post. Either way I don't give a (DARN) what you think you're entitled to!

Earlier in my writing this I brought up the point that on a practical level reducing poverty increasing employment opportunities and better education will do the most to save the kids. I brought up the point that on the international level reducing hunger and eliminating wars will help more than anything else to cut down the child trafficking. I haven't yet heard any counter proposals. Obviously the the campaign is and was started as an attempt to misdirect the criticism of the #republican candidate. To make him look like the savior of the American kids while he is as guilty as anyone in the practice.  That it is extremely rare in the United states where a child is taken for the purpose of sex trafficking is not a great selling point it defeats the purpose of making political hay where the sole pu6this issue has been raised  at this particular point to blame a political party. Most often  and that is only a few times a year that a person infatuated with a child will kidnap the child and sexually abuse that child not traffic them. The result in these cases is that the child is sadly murdered within hours. But we are talking about ""sex trafficking"". Should we not talk about the nude models that come here legally should we not talk about the "" mail order brides"". No that also does not serve our purpose I guess. Most of the so called children that are trafficked are young runaways that are picked up by the pimps and agree to "" work"" trust me the police know the pimps know where they live where their girls work all of that. The pimps provide ""protection"" for the ""girls"" I know. So it goes back to you the citizen.

Our Current Senator Does Not Represent US  As we approach Election Day there are some real differences between me and my opponent. Not just our parties.  He was the lone vote 35-1 against the recent Environmental Justice Act.  He defended the use of chokeholds when New Milford P.D. and the State Police had already banned them in the wake of George Floyd.  He introduced legislation to allow silencers to be sold for rifles; he voted against the bi-partisan ban on ghost guns; he voted against the bi-partisan ban on African Trophies like elephants lions and giraffes.  He called the recent legislation to hold Eversource accountable a first step but he opposed stronger legislation in 2012. If it had passed then we wouldnt be on the first step; wed be at the top of the stairs.  He does not support the workers of our District or the small businesses that rely upon them. He voted against Paid Family Medical Leave which gives employees and small business owners protection to care for a family member who gets cancer or COVID. When minimum wage workers were commuting to NY because of its higher wage my opponent voted against increasing the wage here.  This is the record of OUR Senator. These are OUR votes as much as his. Regardless of your party if you read the above and shake your head; if you read the above and wonder why he voted that way if you think my opponents 20 years in Hartford is too long then we need a change.

For me personally when I advocate restructuring the police I mean stop spending money on people with guns.  Instead I want highly trained unarmed social workers to deescalate situations and to respond to the mentally ill. I want the fire department to respond to drug overdoses with no police presence. I want to invest more into education and schools. I want to invest more into rehab programs and job training classes for repeat offenders.  To accomplish these goals we must spend less on people with guns. Does that mean we would have zero cops? No. It means we disband the current system and start fresh.

It was a cloudy morning fishing on the Upper Range Pond  just me the boat and my entire firearm collection. But when a rainstorm suddenly broke I began taking on water and was forced to abandon my small boat watching every firearm I own sink to the bottom of the pond.  You may think this scenario is implausible but I assure you its a tragically common occurrence in Maine. In fact I know hundreds of Maine gun owners with nearly identical stories  losing all their firearms in these boating accidents.  So when politicians like Virginia Governor Ralph Northam threaten to send in the National Guard to confiscate firearms from innocent law-abiding citizens its a shame so many people dont have any to hand over.  Too many boating accidents.    EDIT: In all seriousness the purpose of this post is to highlight one of the many ways unconstitutional gun confiscation efforts can and will be resisted by law-abiding people.  As counties in other states declare themselves 2nd Amendment Sanctuaries  and here in Maine weve taken our voices to the state capital to defeat countless gun control schemes  we the people will not comply.  Those who want to confiscate firearms from their fellow Americans will find that they wont even know where to look. This nation was founded on the right to keep and bear arms and we will never surrender it.,political,Facebook

Racists don't like being told they are racists.  Those who support politicians who refuse to enact gun safety legislation don't like being told they have blood on their hands when so many people needlessly die.  People who support or remain silent to the rise of fascism in the United States don't like being compared to those in Italy and Germany who supported or stayed silent when Mussolini and Hitler engaged in nearly identical behaviors.  But these people ARE racists. They DO have blood on their hands. And they SUPPORT the END OF AMERICA as a secular capitalistic democracy.  They often wrap themselves in the American flag to pretend to be patriots but what they are really expressing is white nationalism.  These people are in a minority but THEY WILL WIN if the rest of us remain silent and fail to call them out for being racists and/or fascists and/or for loving their guns more than the lives of our neighbors and children.  Don't let these people silence you. Kumbaya will not fix it. Thoughts and prayers will not fix it. Let's all come together won't fix it because there is zero chance it will happen.  This is a time for speaking truth to power. If they are your customers you might lose their business but so what? Why do you want these kind of people as customers? Calling these people out is better than losing America and everything good and decent that it has ever represented.  We must relentlessly challenge bad beliefs until real change is effected and those who hold those beliefs become too embarrassed and ashamed to express them.  If you expect the person next to you to do it while you keep your mouth shut and stay out of controversy THEY WILL WIN.  The End.,political,Facebook
Since I see that there were 36618 new cases of virus yesterday in the United States and since for some reason on The Lone Liberal Republican Facebook page the post below has reached more than 41000 people I thought I would repost it in the hopes it reaches a few more who either need or have friends and family who need a little nudging to be thoughtful about combatting the virus. Different countries have done different thingsTaiwan never locked down but like Thailand almost everyone wears masks and contact tracing is robustand Taiwan has had seven deaths from the virus.  Here is the post (and apologies to those of you who have seen it already)  After months of paperwork to get the Lone Liberal Republican Facebook page eligible to promote posts again we are back. I currently live in Thailand and Facebook shut us down last Spring since our page is about American politics originating from a non-U.S. source. I assure you that I bear no resemblance to Vladimir Putin in any way whatsoever...but in any case it's good to be back.  Thailand is a middle income country of around seventy million people. There have been fifty-eight deaths here from the virus and no local cases for months. Life has mostly returned to normal though almost everyone wears a mask temperatures are taken entering malls restaurants parks and stores and hand sanitizer is everywhere. And the sports stadiums and nightclubs remain closed.  The resistance in the United States to masks and other steps routinely taken in countries in Asia and Europe to defeat the virus is regarded as insane and shameful to folks here...and in most of the world. And the fact that the resistance is framed in terms of Americans' constitutional rights--rights people in much of the rest of the world wish they had--is a horribly inaccurate framing of our rights.  Who thinks that in times of war drafting Americans to fight is an infringement of our Constitutional rights rather than an obligation of our citizenship? I doubt many of the Americans who refuse to wear masks today would be sympathetic to anyone making such an argument about serving in World War II or Vietnam. And in World War II Americans were drafted to do things like storm beaches with machine guns being fired at them as they did so. Being required to wear a piece of cloth around your mouth and nose is an infringement of your Constitutional rights? (Doing so is not an indication of weakness. It is a show of moral and ethical strength.) Lucky our soldiers in World Wars I and II Korea Vietnam Iraq and Afghanistan (though no American soldiers were drafted in the Afghanistan or Iraq conflicts) were more public minded. And lucky our elected officials didn't turn the other cheek when those few who refused their duty did so. Because the other thing here in Thailand and elsewhere around the world where the virus has been beaten back is the rules are enforced.  We are at war with the virus. The human casualties and devastation to our economy and social fabric are warlike devastation. As of the writing of this post the virus has killed more than 172000 Americans in less than eight months. By contrast 58209 Americans were killed in the Vietnam War between 1961 and 1975. 405399 Americans were killed in World War II in the five years between 1941 and 1945.  And any American with a pulse has seen the economic devastation and tearing of our already torn social fabric the virus has wrought.  So it's a war but one that countries from Asia to Europe have shown can be won in a few months of sacrifice. But sacrifice means rules that are uniformly applied and enforced. To date America has been like patients who take half of the antibiotic prescribed and then stop or only remember to take it every other day then complain that they aren't better.  Our political leadership needs to look around the world and get with the program. Thailand's death rate from the virus would have translated to about three hundred deaths given the U.S. population of three hundred and thirty million. What the countries that have defeated the virus have done is not rocket science...certainly the country that put men on the moon more than half a century ago can do this.

Here is the letter that we sent to some Republican Virginia State Delegates & Senators. Please read share follow us on FB & Twitter and visit our Website to Register to vote Watch your lawmakers Live Stream Track Bills and contact lawmakers.  To: Virginia Republicans Re: For distribution to Virginia Republican Delegates and Senators  Democrat Red Flag Bill Violates the US and Virginia Constitutions  Do Democrats understand and know the issues when they propose and pass laws? The answer is NO. Democrats do not listen to facts or their constituents. Democrats only know what their special interest BIG donors tell them to do.  NO ONE will argue that firearms should never be in the WRONG hands. But at the same time we must keep guns in the RIGHT hands. We already have background checks and laws that are supposed to keep firearms out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill. If these laws already exist how do criminals and the mentally ill get guns in the first place? Enforcing these already existing laws must be the first focus and priority before any new laws are passed. The way this Democrat Red Flag Bill is drafted is unconstitutional violating the 2nd 4th 5th 6th 7th14th Amendments of the US Constitution Articles I & IV of the Virginia Constitution and is in conflict with several Virginia Statutes. Why are Democrats trying to pass additional new laws against law abiding citizens; when at the same time democrats are repealing laws to favor criminals?  Lets not be fooled Virginia Red Flag Legislation like all the other democrat gun bills are an ILLEGAL gun grab. In addition Red Flag legislation is DANGEROUS. Never in America should a law abiding citizen be stripped of their right to protect themselves without due process. In Maryland a state with a Red Flag law its government claims that Red Flag laws are necessary to prevent an innocent person from harming himself and others. However in November 2018 an innocent man was approached by Maryland law enforcement demanding the innocent man turnover his LEGAL gun to law enforcement. Like many other law abiding strict constitutionalists he refused. When the innocent citizen refused the police shot him. But wait. This law was supposed to protect people from harming themselves and others. Yet the opposite occurred. Law abiding Innocent people are being shot and killed by the government. Isnt that why we have the 2nd Amendment? So that law abiding citizens can protect themselves from a tyrannical government? Damn right.  When applying liberal logic in these Red Flag law instances government must be Red Flagged and governments guns must be taken away from the government before government harms themselves and others. If there are going to be Red Flag laws then Red Flag laws must work both ways. Here is why. The Maryland Red Flag Law caused a death that would NOT have occurred but for the same proposed Virginia law that is supposed to prevent a death. This is government tyranny plain and simple. If a person is an imminent threat to himself or others get a warrant or detain him until things get figured out; but never steal a persons property without due process. Especially the very property that is protected by the 2nd Amendment for the exact purpose the 2nd Amendment exists for citizens to protect themselves from government tyranny. See the confound & irony?  Currently these are the Red Flag Law states.   Virginia has 340 firearm homicides 1100 suicides (550 by firearm) and 1300 drug overdoses per year. There are more drug overdoses than firearm homicides and suicides. What are the Democrats doing about those drug overdoses that outnumber firearm and suicide deaths? Illegal drugs? Illegal drug trafficking and distribution? Eliminating the major illegal drug source at our Southern Border? The answer is Democrats are LEGALIZING more drugs letting drug offenders out on the streets earlier repealing drug laws and not enforcing drug laws.  Virginia is the 4th safest firearm state 36th least likely suicide state and 31st on the list for depression. Compared to other states with or without red flag laws Virginia is doing well.. So why are Red Flag laws a major issue for Democrats? Answer is FALSE flag fear mongering and another path towards gun confiscation control and power. Without firearms innocent law abiding citizens are defenseless and more reliant on government.  Red Flag laws must never be enacted in Virginia. The law is dangerous and unconstitutional. The way the current Democrat Bill is written violates basic Constitutional due process rights. On the other hand a reasonable Constitutional Bill could have merit in ONLY extreme cases with Constitutional due process. We already agree that guns should NEVER get into the wrong hands. Then why at the same time are Democrats proposing Red Flag laws while also legislating no bail to criminals shorter sentences for convicted violent criminals open borders for illegal criminal aliens and enabling aiding and abetting those same criminals in democrat sanctuary cities? There is NO logic to these Democrat actions if they are truly seeking to reduce crime and help the mentally ill.  At the same time Democrats are encouraging the mentally ill to live in the streets with no treatment Democrats are passing out free needles for heroin use and wanting to legalize addictive psychotic drugs. How do these Democrat laws prevent people from harming themselves and others? They dont. Once again the answer is NOT to pass Red Flag gun control laws. The answer is mandatory treatment of the mentally ill who are dangers to themselves and others. It is already noted that in Connecticut where Red Flag laws were enacted firearm suicides went down at the same time as non-firearm suicides went up. It was a wash. In the end suicide rates did not go down with Red Flag Laws. The mentally ill simply chose a different method of suicide than firearms. It is obvious that the answer to metal illness is treatment not firearm bans.  Here are several important suicide facts. Half of all suicides are by firearm; followed by suffocation poisoning and other methods. Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in America; second among 10-34 year-olds and fourth among 35-54 year-olds. 48000 Americans died by suicide. There were about 1.4 million suicide attempts last year and 15.4 million suicide ideations. It is important to note that ONLY 200000 of all the suicides attempts and ideation NEVER planned a suicide. The suicide rate has increased 31% in the last 18 years from 1999 to 2017. Suicide has a $69 billion dollar economic cost to America. Men are 3.5 times more likely to commit suicide than women. However women are 1.5 times more likely to attempt suicide than men. As it turns out men are better at suicide than women. White men are 70% of suicide victims. The highest suicide age related rate is among 45 to 54 year-olds. There are about 129 suicides per day 5 suicides per hour and one suicide every 12.8 minutes in the United States. How can this be acceptable in the greatest country in the world?  Given all this data the most important three questions that must be answered with respect to firearm possession are--- What is the most common method of suicide attempts? What are the leading causes that drive people to want to attempt suicide? What is the suicide attempt rate among firearm owners versus non-firearm owners? These are the three most important issues when discussing the proposal of Red Flag laws. The answers are POISONING not guns; More suicide attempts are by NON-GUN OWNERS; and the leading cause of suicide is MENTAL ILLNESS not guns. It is apparent that Red Flag laws are NOT the answer. Access to mental health treatment is the answer.  Over 75% of suicide victims tested positive and had a history of drug and/or alcohol addiction; 33.4% of suicide decedents tested positive for alcohol 23.8% for antidepressants and 20.0% for opiates including heroin and prescription pain killers. Individuals with a history of non-fatal suicide attempt are more likely to die by suicide via poisoning rather than firearm. The question then follows: Are suicide attempters later dying by suicide using less lethal methods such as poisoning or are they escalating to more lethal methods like firearm or hanging? The highest proportion of non-fatal suicide attempts was by poisoning which also was the most common method used for subsequent suicide attempts and death. With 1.4 million suicide attempts per year it is apparent that mental illness drug or alcohol addiction and poisoning are the major culprits involving the overall suicide issue NOT firearms. 20% of Americans have a mental illness less than half received mental health treatment. 60% of U.S. counties do NOT have a practicing psychiatrist. Across the U.S. economy serious mental illness causes $193 billion in lost earnings each year. 20% of people experiencing homelessness in the U.S. have a serious mental health condition. 37% of adults incarcerated in the state and federal prison systems have a diagnosed mental illness. 70% of youth in the juvenile justice system have a diagnosed mental illness. 40% of Veterans Health Administration patients have a diagnosed mental illness or substance abuse disorder. 46% of people who die by suicide had a diagnosed mental health condition. 25 million Americans suffer from depression each year. Over 50 percent of all people who die by suicide suffer from major depression. If alcoholics who are depressed are included this figure rises to over 75 percent. Depression is among the most treatable of psychiatric illnesses. One in every five Americans are on at least one anti-psychotic medication. Between 80 percent and 90 percent of people with depression respond positively to treatment and almost all patients gain some relief from their symptoms. But first depression has to be recognized. 90% of people who die by suicide had shown symptoms of a mental health condition according to interviews with family friends and medical professionals (also known as psychological autopsy) Looking at these statistics Red Flag laws are NOT an answer. Mental health treatment for those in need and mental health access for all Americans is the answer. We have a MENTAL HEALTH EMERGENCY in America. We must act IMMEDIATELY with mental health treatment. These numbers are staggering. The use of firearms are merely the suicide end result. But government recklessness is the leading cause of mental illness. Governments non-treatment of mental illness is the causation of people harming themselves and others. Studies find little evidence that firearm access or storage practices are associated with suicide among household members. There is NO causal relationship between household gun ownership and suicide. Going after firearms is a Democrat copout and cover-up for the REAL underlying mental health problems in America.  What treatment is the government providing the 1.4 million suicide survivors before their next suicide attempt? What is government doing about those 55% who need mental illness treatment and dont receive it? What is the government doing about the 60% of American counties who dont have a single psychiatrist? What is the government doing about the mentally ill homeless who live in the streets? What is the government doing about the mentally ill veterans who are not receiving treatment? There is so much that the government can do and has a duty to do; rather than considering passing Red Flag laws that will be of NO consequence or help other than violate the Constitution.  Dont the mentally ill have the same Constitutional Rights as everyone else? Mental illness is a disability. Isnt that why we have the Americans with Disabilities Act? In fact if the mentally ill are singled out and discriminated against by Red Flag laws doesnt the American with Disabilities Act require accommodations by the government before firearms are seized? Shouldnt the mentally ill be accommodated to keep their 2nd Amendment protective weapons and better served with providing mental health treatment first? I raise these issues as a matter of the law and to mock ignorant Democrats. Democrats are too incompetent to realize that when they stomp on one Constitutional Right they invariably violate many more Constitutional Rights at the same time. Its the domino effect of Democrat law breaking.  A Red Flag law will NOT improve anyones mental health. For example is the answer to eliminating arson to raise arsonists but ban matches? Like confiscating weapons is the answer to unlawfully search for 1.4 million people who will attempt suicide each year and red flag them by seizing their cars prescription medications household cleaners and right to travel on bridges or by trains? Of course not. Why not Democrats? Isnt taking away all these other materials and rights that could also do harm to themselves and others the same line of reasoning as unlawfully taking away guns?  We ALWAYS need to prevent the causes of the problem FIRST in order to PREVENT future resulting bad manifestations and symptoms. In this instance we need to prevent mental illness with mental health TREATMENT before suicides and homicides are committed. This is the way government is meant to work.,political,Facebook
On Gun Control  Let's grab one of the 3rd rails of American politics. People have guns for a variety of reasons; personal protection home defense hunting target/competition shooting to keep a family heirloom. Whatever the reason we rely on each other for our safety. We will not be safer by taking firearms from law-abiding citizens.  I was raised in a family of hunters and learned gun safety and responsibility at a very young age. I am concerned that today many in our community do not have this knowledge or respect. That people who are buying guns who don't know how to take care of them are careless in securing them and unskilled in handling them. They just know what they see in the movies on TV or on the internet. They are a danger to themselves and to us! This frightens me.  If you decide to exercise your right to have a gun you also have added responsibility. We need gun control to regulate the militia and keep arms out of the hands of those who lost this right!  We need to regulate the sale and transfer of guns so they do not end up in the hands of those who have lost this right. This regulation needs to consider the risk of the weapon being transferred. An antique gun being passed from parent to child or an antique military firearm presents a very different threat than a concealable rapid-fire or high firepower weapon. We need to have background checks for all transfers and this check should be virtually instantaneous. We need to fix the background check; with today's technology it should not take hours or days.  Past Supreme Court decisions included discussions outlining the 2nd amendment is an individual right for citizens to own firearms privately. And that the militia is citizens who privately own firearms they would bring with them when called to service to defend their community state or our country. I agree! Our founders recognized the militia needs to be regulated. If a person chooses to purchase a firearm becoming part of the militia they should be qualified!  Gun owners should demonstrate:  Knowledge of gun(s) they own  Understanding of their responsibility to secure their weapon (s) and their liability if they don't!  Finally proficiency on the firing range with their personally owned gun(s).  You don't add to my safety if you don't fire your gun accurately and if you don't secure it. I don't have all the answers! We need to discuss: Who determines a person is qualified? What are the records and who keeps them? Should it be your county sheriff? Perhaps an organization like the NRA or local sportsmans clubs? Perhaps the Military? I have concerns about each of these. And we need to discuss what convictions and proceedings strip a person of their right to own a firearm! But I have no doubt. People who decide to exercise their 2nd amendment right to own a gun have a responsibility to the general public.  I lived through Hurricane Katrina when local law enforcement was decimated and focused on restoring public buildings and the courthouses while dealing with their own families and loss. Each family neighborhood and community needs the ability to protect itself whether a hurricane or some other natural disaster. That is the role of the militia today. It is for our collective safety.  Finally as your representative when considering gun control on the federal level I would find what works for the nation. In New York what may make sense and works for New York City and downstate may not work for the 20th congressional district. For the United States what works for New York and California may not work for Alaska Montanna and the more wild states.,political,Facebook
"Republican Brian Fitzpatrick claims to be an ""independent voice"" yet he voted with Trump 83.9% of the time including for the huge tax cut for the rich.  Democrat Scott Wallace actually is independent - he refuses corporate PAC money and has devoted his life to helping make life better for ordinary people.  Republican Brian Fitzpatrick put up giant road signs and played TV ads that were so misleading that they had to be removed or modified.  Scott Wallace's charitable foundation promotes truth in media. It champions women's rights. And it helps to educate the world about climate change and the impact it will have on the poor.  Republican Brian Fitzpatrick has stated that he fully supports reciprocal carry laws that would allow people from other states with loose gun laws to bring their guns to Bucks County.  Scott Wallace wants to ban selling military style weapons to the public and establish universal background checks. He stood alongside students as they rallied for common-sense gun laws.

Wall or Bedlam - Charlie's Soapbox 1/14/19  The degree that the Schumer and Pelosi lead Democrats will go to prevent Donald Trump from having the promised wall is truly disgusting and appalling.  They say they want border security but they sidestep the details citing lofty pie-in-the-sky technology drones and electronic sniffing devices most of which have been on the job for years but have only detection and no deterrent properties against a couple of thousand determined illegals who rush in and overwhelm our border security.  Pelosi and Schumer who never met a pro-abortion bill they didnt like now plead compassion for children while the two wax figures who rebutted President Trump the other night showed about as much compassion as a rattlesnake their cold stiff almost inhuman demeanor and appearance more closely resembling a cold-blooded apparition than a warm-blooded human being.  Pelosi says that a wall sends the wrong message while what it actually does is send a message that America is a nation of law a nation in control a nation whose sovereignty will not be violated by any and all who can traverse its porous borders.  What sends a wrong message is people who are supposed to be concerned with the security of the citizens of the nation who pay their salary and voluminous benefits and whose laws they have sworn to protect and enforce are saying to the world Its alright come on in to America reap our benefits and entitlements enjoy our social welfare use our medical system all free of charge there are plenty of working fools who continue to put people like us in office to waste their hard-earned money.  People wake up do you think the likes of Pelosi Schumer et all give a horse apple about anything but power and the ultimate goal of this diabolical duo is to naturalize millions of new Democrat voters creating an unbeatable majority that wants to turn our nation into a godless socialist purgatory.  And with socialism comes totalitarianism you cant have one without the other because force is the only way the elite can stay on top.  Anybody with enough sense to walk through a door without bumping their head can see where this is heading knows that a properly built wall sill stem the flow of illegals and knows that the Democrats know it will work and therein is the rub.  There are sections of walls that work now San Diego El Paso and other border areas have short stretches of wall that have been extremely effective and the Democrats know it and know that if Trump builds the wall it will severely curtail their dreams of ultimate power and a stranglehold over everything in the United States plus reveal that as in so many other things they dont know what they are talking about.  Schumer-Pelosis ideal America.  Guns would be confiscated there would be no restrictions whatsoever on abortion taxes would be through the roof global warming - the new religion of the left - would become front and center and American manufacturing would again begin a monolithic evacuation.  Self-proliferating bureaucracies would spring up and regulate every facet of personal life in this nation. Eventually you would have to get a permit to dig a hole in your own back yard.  Think thats impossible?  Ask someone in Holland where you have to get a permit to build a dog house.  Getting any kind of license would become a nightmare as self-governing bureaucracies would hire inept political cronies and inefficiency would slow process down to a snails pace.  Think that wont happen?  Ask the people in Italy where the licensing offices only work four days a week use any excuse for a holiday and make even obtaining a marriage license like taking a trip down Alices rabbit hole.  Do you want to live in such a country?  If you dont youd better let your voice be heard because with the Democrat/media cartel it can happen very quickly and you could wake up one morning to find out that your country had been pulled right out from under you.  Note dont look for the Republicans to save you it like a mass castration has taken place on that side of the aisle and theres not enough testosterone - and its female equivalent - left to muster anything but a milquetoast acquiescence.  I for one will not stand silently by and watch a bunch of greedy power-hungry politicians steal the rights and freedoms that so many good men have died to give us.

"Today most of the households in Barrington will receive a flyer from my opponent. He will list his priority as 'cutting taxes'. I would like the voters of Barrington to ask what EXACTLY are his ideas for cutting taxes. Ideologues give good governance a bad name. To say that one is for cutting taxes without also giving specific policy proposals is dishonest. It is a 'dog whistle' and an insult to the voters of Barrington. I have given specific proposals held numerous meetings with citizens on the tax situation in Barrington and like many of you am on fixed retirement income. Two examples of my opponents 'magical thinking' regarding cutting taxes. I have heard long and loud from the gun hobbyists that mental illness is the biggest threat - not the guns themselves. IN PART I agree with them and it is why we are funding 5 teams to do crisis intervention and are funding a psychiatric hospital. These are not cheap but they DO address a specific need that our citizens called out to address. Would Len Turcotte cut this funding to 'lower his taxes""? The second example is the DOT funding. For more than a decade the DOT has had to go back to the Governor to fund basic operational expenses. Their budget is rarely approved and the loss of dilapidated equipment has given us nearly 300 red listed bridges. There is no waste here except from a lack of appropriate funding to stay ahead on repairs. Would Len Turcotte cut this funding to save his taxes? My point is that managing by ideology is thinly disguised deception. I won't lie to you. This will be a tough budget year and we are already working on setting priorities that makes the best use of the money that is available. I won't gaslight you by telling you that there is abundant waste that we can cut and lower taxes. There isn't. We have to start out by being honest with each other.",political,Facebook
Im going to get a lot of hate for this but I disagree with Congressman ORourke regarding the confiscation of certain guns. I recognize the rationale behind removing certain weapons from peoples homes but I question the constitutionality of forced removal. Firstly itd be a logistical nightmare. How will you determine what sorts of weapons someone already has in their home without violating their privacy and individual liberty? Secondly millions of law abiding gun owners will refuse under penalty of law as a matter of principle and protest. I am not opposed to gun reform stricter laws or the barring of certain weapons continuing to be manufactured. I do support guy buyback programs that incentivize people to sell their weapons to the government. But I have my personal limits as a proud Democrat and gun owner.,political,Facebook
WHY is the Probate Court concerns with Guns?  I have received some comments and criticism about WHY I talk about guns and firearms as opposed to Probate related topics. Answer: The Probate Court solely is responsible for the issuance of the Georgia Weapons Carry License commonly called a Concealed Weapon Permit. As the Probate Court Judge I personally am responsible for the issuance of this license to those who live in Burke County.  Of many Probate Court functions application for the Georgia Weapons Carry License is the most common reason that people come into the Probate Court. This is why I frequently talk and write about guns. This is my job.  If you want to read about Georgias specific criteria for the issuance or denial of the Weapons Carry License I refer you to Official Code of Georgia section 16-11-129.  The license is valid for 5 years and renewable. This is an easy process. For both new applicants and renewals the Probate Court charges a fee of $30.00. Additionally the applicant will be fingerprinted and undergo a criminal background check. For this service the Sheriffs Office will charge $54.75 for new applicants OR $15.00 for renewals.  After completion of the background check I personally review the persons application and criminal history. Unless there is a specific reason (as defined within OCGA 16-11-129) for the denial of the license I will sign the Order granting your application. The license itself looks like a drivers license designed to be carried within your wallet or purse.  Why do I talk about guns? As I said this is part of my actual job.  As a citizen myself I support our Georgia statutory right to carry a concealed weapon and I support our 2nd Amendment Constitutional right to keep and bear arms. I worked for 17 years as a felony criminal prosecutor at the District Attorneys Office. I have personally reviewed many cases where citizens have lawfully and legitimately used a firearm to defend themselves to defend others and to defend their homes. Its more than an academic discussion. People really do use firearms to protect themselves. Last of all as a citizen I want to preserve my own right to concealed carry which I do on occasion.

"RANDOM PSYCHOLOGY 135 A It's been a few days since I wrote here last my son and one of my two daughters were home for the weekend a combination Father's day birthday and my son moving on to his first job after graduating college. So busy! Also I have been thinking about the end of the world as we have known for the past few centuries or the end of it all. We are going along happy go lucky ""climate change"" if it is real or not if it is man made or not can we slow it down or it is too late. Who knows right but we do know. Then there is the problem of pollution do we care? We are running out of clean water and other natural resources. Will Jesus come soon enough? We don't realize or we ignore the real problems we have. The truth is no matter who you are where you live country state nation does not matter we are affected equally as we near the end we are becoming more equal. I have a beef with everyone with humanity and its endless source of stupidity. I guess we have seen too many dystopian movies that we actually believe that we will survive the Armageddon. That with enough guns and food to live on for two or three years we will make it to the otherside. Talk about a dream. If you are a believer and truly believe in the 2d coming are you not a fool to think that you need guns after the rapture or food who are you going to leave it for? You can't take your guns and food to the heavens. May be you know that Jesus will have nothing to do with afterall He doesn't like your kind. Do you really want to survive a nuclear war? Even if you lived in a bunker you will die whenever you came out ar may the radiation will kill you inside your bunker. No good options there. All the current evidence shows that the climate change is real and it is accelerating faster than anyone predicted. What will the weather be like in any given location is unknown we may not even be able to grow crops as we are used to and where we are used to. Global population is decreasing slowly but it is it is also getting older far fewer younger people to care for the elderly. And of course when one is taking care of the elderly they are not producing thus earning wages and consuming so it slows down the economy. And our economy depends upon consumption which causes pollution which contributes to the climate change. Life is circles endless circles intertwined making a maze no one knows how to get out. So we are misled and misguided we are told to ignore reality  lest you start asking where to next? How do we get out of this maze? Don't ask go back to sleep. More will follow M. N.

How Demons Recruit Assassins!  Some time ago I said I would write an essay on the mechanisms that demons used to entrap individuals to do evil and more often sadistic acts. Now is the time for writing what I should have written some time ago but I thought it might be too controversial for some. Now that I have observed those who are visiting my Facebook author page I no longer feel that I need to hold back. Recently I re-published an article on my Facebook author page from my local newspaper concerning Nikolas Cruz. He was the young man who perpetrated the shooting at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland Florida that killed 17 and wounded 17 although all were not students some were staff members. In the article I re-published the writer explains that Nikolas Cruz was hearing voices and Cruz identified these voices as demons. Now some of you might think that Cruz is going to use this as a defense in his upcoming trial but I will remind you that Nikolas Cruz was only 19 years old at the time so it is very doubtful that he had planned any legal defense at all. Perhaps he was thinking of killing himself afterward like so many other assassins who attack schools churches synagogues or musical events like the one held in Las Vegas Nevada where so many hundreds were either wounded or killed outright. What kind of evil does it take to do such a thing? Looking back on these mass killings which are truly a recent development you wonder what kind of mind does it take to prepare and carry out such an attack? These attacks are often skillfully planned and carried out. The mass killings that have taken place around this country as well as other countries such as the recent killings in New Zeeland where another sanctuary of our Lord God was attacked defy explanation. The perpetrators of such horrors usually take their own lives so we never know why they did what they did. Some suggest they do it for the notoriety but if you die in the end of what value is notoriety? The killings in New Zeeland prompted a harsh crack down on gun owners by their government. Perhaps in a desperate act to calm fears of future attacks but do you believe that the next demon recruit will turn in their guns or bombs? Not likely! Demons recruit their victims like a spy may recruit someone who they surmise fits the profile of someone who could meld into a fraternity such as the CIA. The demon is on orders from Satan to find someone who he can use to wreak death or destruction on a shocking scale. An act that will leave people gasping shaken and wondering who could do such a horrible thing to all of those innocent people! Once the demon has found its mark it begins a psychological attack first by simply talking to its victim. At first it may seem to the victim that he is hearing his own thoughts but then one day his thoughts begin to talk back. The victim is puzzled at first and then things begin to get eerie when conversations between the demon and him or her begin taking place. The victim at first believes that they can simply stop listening and talking to the demon and it will go away. However that is not up to them because only the demon can end the connection now established between them unless an exorcism is performed. If you should hear thoughts that you believe are not your own do not repeat them to anyone including yourself. That is one mechanism that demons use to establish a connection between you and them. Getting back to where I left off once the demon has established a connection with its intended victim then the demon can take its time unless Satan wants a quick kill. Otherwise the demon will proceed at its own pace. As the demon continues to strengthen its connection with its intended victim the conversations can begin to get contentious as the victim and potential assassin begins to want to end this untenable relationship but that is not so easily done. In fact unless the victim of a demonic attack does not seek spiritual help very soon after talking with a demon it may be too late for them to reverse course. The next thing the demon will probably do is to let its victim know who is in charge. The demon may begin by intimidating its victim by using threatening language such as threatening to make sure the victim goes straight to hell after his or her soon to be death or talk to him or her in a demonic sounding voice as if mimicking Satan himself. Other things the demon can do and usual does is to talk to its recruit without ceasing wearing its victim down emotionally physically and psychologically to the point that the victim is on the verge of collapse. This can go on for days preventing the intended victim sleep until the recruit begs for the demon to stop. But the demon will not stop until it gets what it wants and that is usually an agreement by the victim to do whatever the demon wants. The demon usually tells the victim that if you do what I say then I will leave your life forever. Demons are notorious liars and will say anything to get what it wants. At this point the demon will begin instructing its recruit on how to carry out whatever it has decided to do and will carefully select its target. Demons are very intelligent beings and have been around for thousands of years and know the ins-and-outs of this material world like the back of their hand. They know the recruit has the wherewithal to carry out the assignment; otherwise they would not have been selected. After careful planning the recruit may begin to get cold feet but the demon will not allow the recruited assassin to back out and fear and anxiety may now grip the recruit day and night. As a spiritual darkness engulfs the victim they feel completely helpless and isolated unable to function normally. The assassin is now living a terrifying life feeling trapped between two possible evils: the threat of being taken to hell or the possibility of facing a lifetime in prison or worse. Most victims are now so desperate to be free of the demon and return to a normal life they will agree to perform whatever evil act the demon may be forcing them to do in the hopes that this demonic relationship will soon be over and done with and they can be free again. Unfortunately for them it will never end! At this point the victim may not be able to seek spiritual help because of the fear of the consequences of seeking that help. However should they find the proper and effective spiritual help they need they can be saved from Satans clutches. Should the victim not find the help they so desperately need to stop this madness they are about to do they will usually follow through with the attack although some have committed suicide in hopes of escaping the evil demon. Often the victim after having perpetrated the attack will not even know that he or she was involved in the attack just as Nikolas Cruz seemed to have been unaware of what was happening all around him. If Nikolas Cruz had killed himself like most mass murder assassins generally do then most people would continue to believe that Nikolas Cruz must have just gone berserk. Most people will believe the psychological evaluation done by a professional whatever they may end up diagnosing. Largely because the professional psychologist or psychiatrist will never give the idea of demon possession an even casual thought. In the long run these demonic attacks will continue because no one has a solution or will accept that demon possession is even possible. Many Churches also do not believe demons exist in this so-called modern society and will go along with the professional analysis and accept that the perpetrator must have gone crazy even though the Holy Scripture is replete with examples of our Lord Christ Jesus and His Apostles casting out these evil spirits. Many people today do not accept that there is a spiritual side to our lives but instead all too many believe that life is just about our physical selves our senses our brain and what we can experience with them. That we developed from an amoeba or some other small organism until we eventually through evolution became the so-called modern mankind we are today. Until such times as we can change to a less scientifically based civilization that does not worships the things of this world we will continue to live in fear and terror. Never knowing when the next mass murder will happen or some demonic army like ISIS will appear again to bring fear horror and uncertainty to an isolated world.

Pastor Powell Believes The Congressional candidates view on the Issues of Today. 20/20 Vision: Clear Policy positions of United States Congressional candidate Rev. Mark J. Powell M.Div. (D-IN 9)  Americas political managers are apparently in the fog of placation and not statesmen of character and courage who love the United States. That ends in 2020 with this candidacy and God willing the election of a strong moral voice for America on November 3rd. ~ United States Congressional candidate Rev. Mark J. Powell M.Div. (D-IN 9) 02/02/2020  Economic Justice: The wage gap has become a monumental problem in the United States as is rising homelessness and poverty. Pastor Powell believes and will support 1. Legislation that offers housing programs to the homeless decriminalizing homelessness community job programs and a focus on a social safety net to keep our veterans families and individuals from becoming homeless and give a hand up to fit whatever their unique situation may be. 2. Supporting a livable wage. No one should be working full-time in America and living in poverty. 3. Supporting low-income housing financial aid job training programs and small business grant programs 4. New job creation in rural areas in industries that are booming. 5. Fully funding our social safety net programs such as WIC food stamps disability and mental health services. Those who can work need a sliding scale of services to help them get back on their feet or supplement poverty-wages. Those who cannot work should not have to worry if they can feed their family.  If there is a poor person among your brothers (and sisters) in any of the towns of the land that the Lord your God is giving you do not be hardhearted or tightfisted toward your poor neighbor. Deuteronomy 15:7  Immigration: This nation was built on immigration. We need comprehensive reform that is fair safe and moral with compassion at its center. Pastor Powell rejects the scapegoating and the fear mongering of immigrants and refugees or supports the policies of the Trump administration and family separation. Pastor Powells birth father was an immigrant from Poland after surviving World War II he personally knows we need immigration reform. But reform needs to take place with the governing hand of compassion.  Pastor Powell believes and will support 1. Protect Dreamers and make DACA permanent. 2. Make it easier for people to enter legally and apply for citizenship by following our laws/rules and to make it possible for those who are already here illegally to apply for status and begin paying taxes and living here legally. Except for a history of violent criminal offenses or gang activity there is no reason for deportation of immigrants who have been here for decades  we must provide a way for them to come out of the shadows instead. 3. Stop illegal narcotics and human trafficking and create a more secure border with better technology and increased personnel by targeting venomous criminals and crooked governments instead of frightened families and innocent children fleeing violence. 4. Stop the mass-deportation force increased authority and harsh practices of ICE. These goals line up with ours as Christians. The hate exhibited against immigrants must stop. Except for our Native American brothers and sisters (which is a policy paper in itself) we are all immigrants.  When a foreigner lives with you in your land do not mistreat him. The foreigner living with you must be treated as one of your native-born. Love them as yourself for you were foreigners in Egypt. I am the Lord your God. Leviticus 19:33-34  Environmental Protections: Global warming is real and we are seeing more and more affects of it every year. The only debate on what we will do to act responsibly. Logic commands us to take care of the earth and all creation. You and I are responsible for this crisis and in so many ways we have failed. Pastor Powell supports government action and personal action to care for our planet and to protect and treat animals humanely and respectfully.  Pastor Powell believes and will support 1. Immediate Action to create the United States Department of the Environment 2. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions 3. Protecting our forests national parks and arctic regions worldwide by investing in environmentally compassionate technology and jobs 4. Humane treatment of animals a national animal rights ethics code that is stronger and funding for better systems of animal control adoption and tighter regulation on the meat and other industries for humane treatment. 5. Reinstating the restrictions against ivory puppy mills and hunting that the Trump Administration rolled back!!!  A generation goes and a generation comes but the earth remains forever. The sun rises and the sun goes down and hastens to the place where it rises. The wind blows to the south and goes around to the north; around and around goes the wind and on its circuits the wind returns. All streams run to the sea but the sea is not full; to the place where the streams flow there they flow again. There is no remembrance of former things nor will there be any remembrance of later things yet to be among those who come after. Ecclesiastes 1:4-711.  Health Insurance Reform:  Health insurance coverage is not a RIGHT for the elite wealthy or Congress it is a human right. A free market should not be able to dictate who is more worthy of living or dying due to lack of needed treatment and care. Quality care required medication and medical services (including preventative care dental health prenatal/maternal care and mental health care) must be available to every person in this country regardless of status past medical history or income level.  Pastor Powell believes  1. Due to this domestic Emergency Pastor Powell will sponsor legislation in January that will state: beginning July 1 2021 all citizens earning a household income of $99999 or less will have immediate access to Congressional Health Insurance. Pastor Powell believes this enacted legislation will motivate all Representatives and Senators to ACT on this issue immediately.  Behold I will bring to it health and healing and I will heal them and reveal to them abundance of prosperity and security. Jeremiah 33:6  Criminal Justice Reform:  America needs a complete overhaul of our criminal justice system from the overpopulation of our prisons to abolishment of the death penalty  Pastor Powell believes and will support  1. Focus on rehabilitation not harsh punishment. 2. The total elimination of the use of torture or inhumane treatment of prisoners for any reason at home or abroad. 3. Mercy and value rehabilitation when possible over harsh punishment. This means advocating for humane treatment of prisoners lesser prosecution for drug and minor arrests and favoring rehabilitation over long prison sentences unless public safety is at risk. Pastor Powell supports increased budgets for joint FBI DEA DIA DHS CIA and Special Forces anti-gang and international political corruption task forces commanded by the Secretary of Homeland Security and reporting directly to the President of the United States. 4. The absolute abolishment of the death penalty. 5. The immediate elimination of private prisons have led to mass fraud and abuse. Americans are the most over-incarcerated people in the world and this disproportionately affects minorities and the poor. THAT is not justice and needs to be overhauled. 6. That any law enforcement officer and member of the United States military who commits crimes are held accountable and that proper training and funding is provided to every police district and military base.  Remember those in prison as if you were their fellow prisoners and those who are mistreated as if you yourselves were suffering. Hebrews 13:3  Firearm Safety:  Children country music fans the LGBTQ community college students worshipers at Churchhave been victims of the mindless menace of violence which affects us ALL and it ought to bring us together across partisan lines for common sense reforms. More than half of Americans  both Democrats and Republicans  support firearm safety by keeping guns out of the hands of the mentally ill and broader background checks without gun show loopholes.  Please know Pastor Powell is for the People keeping their firearms and that includes handguns and long barreled weapons.  Why?  Pastor Powells father Joseph was born in Kielce Poland in 1928. He was 11 when the National Socialists (Nazis) invaded and 16 when the Stalinist Communist Socialists took over after the Nazis. It was a miracle Joseph survived the Displaced Persons camps and came to the United States via the Port of New Orleans and to Chicago where he met and married Pastor Powells mother. When pastor was a small boy his father told him there was no difference between the SocialistsNazi or Communistthey both outlawed private gun ownership and the people were at the mercy of the merciless. So not on Pastor Powells watch will Second Amendment Rights be abridged.  Pastor Powell believes and will support 1. Any common-sense firearm safety legislation such as expanded background checks keeping guns out of the hands of criminals and severely mentally ill closing the gun show loopholes.  Teach us to number our days that we may gain a heart of wisdom. Psalm 90:12  #pastorpowellbelieves2020   Note: Pastor Powell would like to thank and give credit to the Christian Democrats of America  who have been a lighthouse on the current stormy political sea. May God continue to bless their political ministry which benefits our nation and the entire world.,political,Facebook
As election day nears I want to remind you of my stance on three major social issues.   Gun Safety  I am proud to have received the Moms Demand Action Gun Sense Candidate distinction. We need to always be vigilant on saving lives and public protection as well as getting to the causes of all of the senseless gun deaths. I work to save lives and make our community safe. We must keep guns out of dangerous hands.   Environment  I have been fighting to Preserve Greens Farms and I will do the same for Westport. I will work to push our state toward fully renewable energy in a very aggressive fashion similar to Westport. We must prevent our air from being polluted cut use of power plants that rely on dirty sources and we must get TESLA to CT!   Womens Health  I am 100% pro-choice. I will oppose any state legislation that allows the government to interfere in a womans right to choose and I will do whatever I can to protect that right. I am also in favor of passing legislation to protect and fund public health clinics and hospitals.,political,Facebook
I was asked why I dont take Covid and the mask situation seriously. I said that I do take the virus seriously. I believe the people who are disseminating the information to us have a long long track record of lying to and showing dismissive contempt for American citizens as a whole.  At one point the disease was supposed to have a 5% death rate. The death rate has now been reduced to less than 1/3 of 1% worldwide. The truth is Im not opposed to masks at all. Much like carrying a firearm I dont and wont shame anyone for deciding to wear one or not. Sort of a my body my choice situation I suppose.  However when considering the trustworthiness of information coming from our politicians Ive been unable to reconcile the fact that 200000 people protesting in the streets is met with little to no concern but a bar restaurant or hair salon with 10 people in it could be disastrous. The idea that a Trump rally of 18000 people is a significant risk but a group of 20000 students tearing down statues isnt leaves me perplexed.  Further how could you possibly take anyone seriously who mandates that free citizens stay at home and wear masks in public but also calls for the acceptance of millions of immigrants entering our society illegally with no record of immunizations against more common and deadly diseases every day.  The truth is that our political leaders just like with guns drugs our national debt or sex trafficking have absolutely no idea what theyre talking about and no plan outside of whats handed to them 6 seconds before they reach the podium.  So I choose to protect myself as I see fit. If anyone doesnt like it Im ok with that. Just think of it as a protest. That seems to be ok with many people.  A friend sent that to me. I agree 100%,political,Facebook
In response to the mass casualty incident in Colorado the President and the Democrats in Congress are again proposing legislation that will do NEXT TO NOTHING (if not nothing) to stop firearm homicides. The assault weapons ban that seems to be the go to of the left is again being touted as the miracle solution. The fact is rifles of all types- not just so called assault rifles- are used in less than 2.6% of homicides according to the FBI Expanded Homicide Data Tables (2019). The total number of homicides with rifles for 2019 (the most recent year of data from the FBI) was 364.  2017 was the worst year in recent memory for homicides with a rifle. In 2017 the Las Vegas Music Festival Shooting resulted in 61 deaths. Even with this mass event the total number of homicides with rifles was 384 (this is for every state and US territory).  One homicide with any weapon in is too many. But the point must be made that far more people are murdered with knives than are murdered with all rifles (1476 in 2019). More people are murdered with hands and feet than are murdered with all rifles (600 in 2019). More people are murdered with clubs and hammers than are murdered with all rifles (397 in 2019).  The President is NOT proposing an assault weapons ban to save lives. So what is the point of an assault weapons ban? It is to take guns out of the hands of law abiding citizens. Any argument that an assault weapons ban would greatly reduce homicides is disingenuous at best and an outright lie at worst.

Here's a longish post from my blog. Hope you give it a read  From Reconstruction to Black Lives Matter  (Part 1)  In the last 6 weeks we have witnessed protest actions that have been massive sustained multi-racial and mainly young people. What began in one city Minneapolis scaled up in size and across space at astonishing speed.  The attitude of the protesters wasnt one and done. Quite the contrary marchers came back the next day and then the next and then the next. The uprising became a flood that refuses to ebb.  No wonder this moment feels unique. And it may well be. But this isnt the first time that a powerful anti-racist uprising has shaken the country. Two other moments  First Reconstruction (1865-1877) and Second Reconstruction (1955-1968)  come immediately to mind. And a quick glance at each provides some perspective and gives some clues as to why this moment not only could constitute the Third Reconstruction but also bring the country to the doorstep of Martin Luther Kings Beloved Community.  First Reconstruction  Not long after the guns fell silent in 1865 an experiment in interracial democracy and equality  the First Reconstruction  began. Its mission was to redress the inequities and legacy of slavery and solve the problems arising from the readmission to the Union of the 11 states that had seceded.  As a first step the Republican-controlled Congress passed three Constitutional amendments. The 13th Amendment (ratified 1865) abolished slavery. The 14th (1868) provided equal protection under the law and birthright citizenship. And the 15th (1870) extended the right to vote to all adult males in the North and South. In the midst of this flurry of legislation the first Civil Rights Act was also enacted in 1866. Together these amendments and bills reshaped the relations between the states and the federal government as well as extended democratic rights to people of African descent in the North and South.  In the meantime Congress established the Freedmens Bureau (formally known as the Bureau of Refugees Freedmen and Abandoned Lands) to assist the formally enslaved transitioning to a new life in a region ravaged by war and two and a half centuries of slavery.  At the heart of the Reconstruction process was the purposeful actions of the newly free African Americans along with their white (Republican) allies to create a biracial governments in the South. These newly constituted governments pushed an agenda of radical reforms including the founding of public schools for Black and white children. While they werent without problems which their critics exaggerated these problems paled in comparison to what they accomplished and the promise that they held for the future.  Despite Reconstructions undeniable progress including the election of Black representatives to the Congress for the first time efforts to undermine it were present from the start. By 1873 many white Southerners were calling for the return of white supremacy  Redemption they called it  and violence targeting Black people was on the rise. Meanwhile an economic downturn was exacerbating racial tensions. At the federal level a series of Supreme Court decisions limited the scope of Reconstruction-era laws and federal support for the Reconstruction Amendments.  But the crippling blow to Reconstruction came later in 1877 when federal troops were withdrawn from the southern states as part of the Hayes-Tilden compromise. Once this happened the opponents of Reconstruction who had been biding their time but not their ambition to restore the old order went on a rampage to overthrow this experiment in interracial democracy and restore white supremacy. At the top of this counterrevolution stood the former slave owners and by their side and doing their dirty work was a hardscrabble gang of other white people of lesser station and rank. Fed since childhood on the poison of racism the promise of a small share of the plunder and other privileges of whiteness they became the shock troops of counterrevolution.  Drowned in a sea of blood  Slavery wasnt restored but the chance of a democratic and egalitarian future for the South was drowned in a sea of violence and blood. In its place a coercive and racialized mode of super-exploitation and governance arose. Its economic base was tenant sharecropping dependent Black (and white) labor and convict leasing in an economy in which cotton was still king.  Strict segregation the evisceration of the political rights and representation of Black people and the systematic use of terror defined its political and social structures. It didnt exactly fit the classical (and too rigid) definition of a fascist state  terrorist dictatorship of the most reactionary sections of finance capital  as I learned it in the communist movement. But a dictatorship it was. And fascist-like for sure. Its storm troopers wore white robes and conducted night raids. Black women were raped and Black men killed. Houses were burned and children terrorized. The spectacle of public hangings became a staple of Southern life.  The barons of Wall Street werent exactly in the drivers seat (although financial institutions and manipulators were involved) as the communist schema suggested but the Jim Crow South was much closer to a fascist-like regime than anything we have seen since then. (Of course that might change if Trump were to win reelection in November.)  This lurch backward from the dawn of freedom provoked W. E. B. Du Bois to write . . . the slave went free; stood a brief moment in the sun; then moved back again toward slavery.  Lending an essential hand to this lurch backward according to Henry Louis Gates in his masterful study Stony the Road: Reconstruction White Supremacy and the rise of Jim Crow were respectable men of cloth and pen minstrel and movie makers and judges and scientists. Each of them white and respected in polite society trafficked in the caricature and dehumanization of Black people in order to normalize and naturalize the new racialized hierarchical social arrangements. Everybody was once again in their proper place especially the formerly enslaved. All was right with the world.  And yet as Steven Hahn has shown in his impressive historical study A Nation under Our Feet this lurch backward to dictatorial rule met resistance at every step. So much so that it took more than two decades to fully institutionalize in practice and law this new mode of racial exploitation segregation and oppression. Once embedded however it proved durable although it was never able to completely suppress resistance in both old and new forms in the decades that followed. Not least the Great Migration to the North and West. Nor were the racists in high and low places able to prevent the flourishing of a distinct African American culture and the building of institutions that gave spiritual aesthetic moral economic and political uplift and agency to a racially exploited and abused people at a time when the lights of freedom and equality grew faint.  One can only wonder what the South and the entire country might look like had the federal troops remained in the South the reconstruction governments been given the resources and space to do their work and if broad scale and radical land redistribution occurred.  A missed opportunity  But that wasnt to be. An opportunity was missed. The arc of freedom bent backwards. And the South quickly mutated into a region of hyper segregation and racist oppression a profitable sink for corporations searching for low wages and union free labor and a counterweight against progressive and radical politics on the national level.  And it wasnt until the close of World War II and the changes it wrought  the rise of national independence movements the expansion the socialist world the expectation that full citizenship rights would be granted to African Americans returning from the battlefield or laboring on the home front and a U.S. ruling class worried that the atrocity that was Jim Crow might compromise their ascent to the apex of global power and the leader of the free world  that some cracks began to appear in this racist edifice of inhumanity and greed.  But not enough to bring it down. That would have to await but not for long. What began in Montgomery Alabama on a seemingly small scale in 1955 and counted in its leadership a young prophetic African American minister mushroomed into a powerful and transformative movement  a Second Reconstruction  that tore down the deeply rooted structures of legal segregation and systematic discrimination in the Old Confederacy changed the hearts and minds of millions and powered the passage of landmark civil and voting rights legislation in the Congress.  Practicing nonviolent mass action this movement for the ages captured the moral conscience of the country and the attention of the political class. Much like Frederick Douglass a century earlier its leaders especially Rev. Martin Luther King combined a liberating vision  derived from scripture the countrys founding documents and the lived experience of Black people  with strategic acumen tactical adroitness expansive politics and a genuine patriotism.  The scale and moral authority of this movement were such that President Lyndon Johnson felt compelled to address the nation on this matter. One would have to go back to Lincoln and ahead to Obama to find such oratory.  Rarely are we met with a challenge said Johnson not to our growth or abundance or our welfare or our security but rather to the values and the purposes and the meaning of our beloved nation. The issue of equal rights for American Negroes is such an issue. And should we defeat every enemy and should we double our wealth and conquer the stars and still be unequal to this issue then we will have failed as a people and as a nation.  There is no Negro problem he continued. There is no Southern problem. There is no Northern problem. There is only an American problem.  Johnson ended his extraordinary speech by repeating the iconic phrase of Dr. King and the civil rights movement We shall overcome.  This speech was a credit to Johnsons willingness to change in the face of changing circumstances. But in the first place it was an acknowledgement of the transforming power and moral authority of the civil rights movement. Indeed without King and the courageous army of civil rights activists the Second Reconstruction  the bringing down of the Walls of Jericho in the South  would have been no more than an idle wish.  Gave impulse  But the legacy of the Civil Rights movement didnt end here. It also gave an impulse to the anti-racist struggle and Black Power movement across the country and in the urban centers of the North and West that exploded in rebellion against racist oppression deep poverty and police repression in the second half of the 1960s.  It triggered as well a rights revolution challenged national priorities inspired new social movements and gave space for a rebirth of the radical imagination. Meanwhile it dimmed the lights on McCarthyism and the stultifying conformity and stasis of the 1950s.  Finally the civil rights movement resonates today and bequeaths to our common posterity the greatest revolutionary democrat of the 20th century Martin Luther King. He too belongs to the ages.  But these achievements as enormous as they were were still only a down payment on the promise of freedom only the first stage in the struggle for full freedom and equality. But as it turned out the transition to the next stage of struggle proved difficult in the face of a new conjuncture and resistance. The struggle for equality didnt go into hibernation. In fact victories were won in the decades that followed none more impressive than the election of the countrys first African American President Barack Obama. But the transformation of the grid of structural racism and the enactment of full blooded anti-racist policies in every sphere of life would have to await another popular and sustained anti-racist uprising a Third Reconstruction.

(2 Min Read)  HYPOTHETICAL CASE: What Should Blacks Do With Career Criminals Like Kwame?  His Story:  1. Kwame was a defiant child and student since pre-k. He was a school bully and tough guy who often disrupted class. Teachers and Principals exhausted all strategies therapies and placement options to deescalate his horrible behavior eventually placing him in a self-contain program with fewer students one teacher and one aid.  2. By age 16 Kwame dropped out of school sold drugs (weed/crack) and committed several crimes including assault and battery. His record was sealed due to age (minor). A judge eventually placed him in juvenile dentention where education and therapy was mandated.  3. When released by 18 he's terrorizing families by breaking in the homes and cars of neighbors. He even has an illegal gun he uses to intimidate his victims when he robs them. He's caught and sentenced 3 years.  4. A judge releases Kwame early with probation because it is his first felony As An Adult but not the first as you've learn.  5. Months later after his release he commits the same... crime! BURGLARLY! He's sentenced to serve 3 years but gets out early on good behavior and probation for the remaining time. While locked up he finishes high school.  6. At roughly 22 he's smarten up. He thinks he's mastered understanding the loopholes of the system; so-- Kwame gets a job starts community college in his local city and after two years enters a university.  7. With a job and college he has access to money! Financial aid grants and loans. The job at a local restaurant helps a lot and the tips are a good bonus. To top things off he's living rent free with a young woman who has HUD assistance and monthly food support for one child Kwame is not the father of.  8. Kwame has a plan: He decides to use his achievements to mask another side hustle: He starts selling drugs again..! Except this time he's buying pure cocaine in the form of powder and blocks weighing 2 pounds.... He has a semi automatic plenty of ammunition (ridiculous rounds) and is domestically abusive to his girlfriend and child. He is now 25 years old and he is feeling like King Kong! He believes he has mastered the game and he does. Flying low under the radar (3 years now) he's found a place to store his Dope and illegal guns outside his woman's apartment. Kwame is flipping Government Funds for college and money he's earning at the restaurant.  9. One day his girlfriend made a 911 domestic violence call. Fearing for her life she ran out of her apartment leaving her child with her abuser to get help. Kwame made threats to kill her and she'd had enough! The only way out was to end it once and for all. Telling his secret would free her and keep her alive to raise her child.  10. Cops search the apartment finding nothing but the girlfriend told of his storage holding the dope guns and heavy ammunition. Kwame was asked to give them the keys to search the storage room.  11. Kwame was suppose to get nearly 40 years according to the Judicial Point System. He was considered a Career Criminal at 25 years old. The judge was moved with compassion realizing Kwame would be older than him when released. Kwame was sentenced to serve nearly 28 years... but with the gun charge later dropped (only because it wasn't loaded) he ultimately served nearly 23 years! Kwame went to prison at the age of 25 and was released at 47.  Was the system wrong? What Would Blacks Sentence A Career Criminal Like Kwame?  Byrd's Blog,political,Facebook
"WANT TO KNOW WHY WE ARE VOTING FOR TRUMP! IT'S YOU!.  If you are a liberal who cant stand Trump and cannot possibly fathom why conservatives would ever vote for him let me finally fill you in.  Its not that we love Donald Trump so much. Its that we cant stand you. And we will do whatever it takes  even if that means electing a rude obnoxious unpredictable narcissist (your words-not ours) to the office of President of the United States  because the only thing we find more dangerous to this nation than Donald Trump is you.  How is that possible you might ask? Well you have done everything in your power to destroy our country from tearing down the police to tearing down our history to tearing down our borders. You are systematically destroying our schools and brainwashing our kids into believing socialism is the answer to anything (despite being an unmitigated failure everywhere) while demonizing religion and faith and glorifying abortion violence and thug culture.  From calling us racists every time we expect everyone of any skin color to follow our laws equally to telling us that our tolerance of lifestyles we dont agree with isnt nearly enough....no we must celebrate any lifestyle choice or gender option (forget science) you throw our direction or you think its fine to calls us homophobic or some other degrading slur  and ironically all while lecturing us on hate speech. While you gaslight us about 52 genders polyamory grown men in dresses sharing public locker rooms with little girls and normalize the sexualization of young children you simultaneously ridicule us for having the audacity to wish someone a Merry Christmas or hang a flag on the 4th of July stand for the national anthem or (horror or horrors) don a MAGA hat in public. So much for your tolerance. Do you see why we think you are hypocrites??  Were also not interested in the fact that you think you can unilaterally decide that 250 years of the right-to-bear-arms against a tyrannical or ineffective government should be abolished because you cant get the violence in the cities you manage under control. Free-speech should be tossed out the window history erased and those who disagree with your opinions are fair game for public harassment or doxing. Spoiled children with nose-rings and tats who still live off their parents dime should be allowed to destroy cities and peoples livelihoods without repercussions. That chaos and lawlessness and disrespect for authority should be the norm. This is your agenda. And you wonder why we find you more dangerous than Donald Trump?  Your narrative is a constant drone of oppressor/oppressed race-baiting intended to divide the country in as many ways as you possibly can. You love to sell victim-hood to people of color every chance you get because its such an easy sell compared to actually teaching people to stand on their own two feet and take personal responsibility for their own lives their own communities and their own futures. But you wont do that. You will never do that because then you will lose control over people of color. They might actually start thinking for themselves God forbid!  This is why we will vote for Donald Trump.It is not because he is the most charming character on the block nor because he is the most polite politician to have ever graced the oval office. It is not because he is the most palatable choice not that we love his moral character or because he never lies. It is because we are sick to death of you and all of the destructive crap you are doing to this once beautiful and relatively safe country. Your ineffective and completely dysfunctional liberal leadership(?) has literally destroyed our most beautiful cities our public education system and done its damndest to rip faith out of peoples lives.  However bad Donald Trump may be (and he is far from perfect) every day we look at you and feel that no matter what Donald Trump says or does there is no possible way he could be any worse for our country than you people are.  We are sick to death of your stupid destructive ignorant and intolerant behavior and beliefs  parading as wokeness. We are beyond sick of your hypocrisy and B.S. We are fed up with your disrespectful divisiveness and constant unrelenting harping and whining and complaining (while you live in the most privileged nation in the world) while making literally zero contributions of anything positive to our society. Your entire focus is on ripping things down never ever building anything up. Think about that as there is something fundamentally very wrong in the psychology of people who choose destruction as their primary modus operandi.  If Donald J Trump is reelected rather than blame us look in the mirror and blame yourselves. Because you are the ones that are responsible for the rise of Donald Trump. You are the ones who have created this monster that you so despise by your very actions your refusal to respect your fellow Americans and the things that are important to us.  You have made fun of the fly-over states the people who cling to their guns and religion the middle class factory workers and coal miners and underprivileged rural populations that you dismissively call yahoos and deplorables. You have mocked our faith and our religion. You have mocked our values and our patriotism. You have trampled our flag and insulted our veterans and treated our first responders with contempt and hatred.  You have made environmentalism your religion while trashing every city you have taken responsibility for. You scream from the rooftops about global warming and a green new deal while allowing tens of thousands of homeless people to cover your streets in literal garbage needles and plastic waste without doing a single thing to help them solve the environmental crisis that your failed social policies are creating. But were supposed to put YOU in charge of the environment while gutting our entire economy to institute this plan when you cant even clean up a single city?? You complain  endlessly  yet have failed to solve a single social problem anywhere. In fact all you have done is create more of them.  Weve had enough. We are tired of quietly sitting by and being the silent majority. So dont be surprised when the day comes when we finally respond. And trust me its coming sooner than you might think. And also trust me when I say it wont be pretty. Get ready.  If Donald Trump is reelected it will be because you and your comrades have chosen to trash the police harass law-abiding citizens and go on rampages destroying public property that we have all paid for and you have zero respect for.  If Donald Trump is reelected it will be because we are sick of your complete and utter nonsense and destruction. How does it feel to know that half of this country finds you FAR more despicable than Donald J. Trump the man you consider to be the anti-Christ? Let that sink in. We consider you to be more despicable more dangerous more stupid and more narcissistic than Donald Trump. Maybe allow yourself a few seconds of self-reflection to let that sink in. This election isnt about Donald Trump vs. Joe Biden. This is about Donald Trump vs. YOU.  So if on the morning of November 4 (or more likely December 29 by the time the Supreme Court will weigh in on the mail-in ballot fiasco we are headed towards) if Donald J. Trump is reelected the only people you have to blame is the left-wing media drones and yourselves. You did this. Yep you!""  Time to walk away! BY- ANONYMOUS",political,Facebook
In reference to the bill that passed which allows basically anyone to carry without a permit or training Im very worried.  Im worried for African Americans. The ones who think this law applies to them and the ones who may get shot without cause because their skin color was perceived dangerous without the guns.  Im worried for police officers who may come in contact with more people with guns. The law has now insulated some right wing and extremist even more.  Im worried that somehow this state government thought that a state who voted almost unanimously for Trump and Mary Fallon in twice is capable of being a rationale responsible body of citizens.  Im worried for all the stray bullets and the innocent bystanders since every armed citizens may decide to take the law into their own hands.  Im worried that our mental health issues will exasperate in this climate. With a system that already fails daily how many people with mental illnesses will now decide to carry.  My mind is telling me to get the hell out of here. My heart is still attached here.  This is going to be really bad.,political,Facebook

"Point of existing law..... The state has a sales tax. On pencils on clothing on cars on everything. How do you create another sales tax? If you allow politicians to create a multi tiered sales tax you are ignorant unaware and really deserve what you get. But since I'll be getting hammered by your stupidity please fight against taxing anything with higher rate than the standard rate (ie weed). If you are dumb enough to allow this devious little enterprise to flourish you kill voter control over taxes. You give it away. Everytime the government can't balance their checkbook they can simply add something else to this list of things that pay excess sales tax. You know cigs alcohol guns ammunition porn sex toys luxury cars boats mink coats motorcycles and antiques will be on that list before you know it.  The mantra of treat weed ""like alcohol"" is turning into a lie. Around here you can get a license to sell booze for a few hundred bucks.

"A Personal Encounter With Gun Violence  A Survivors Perspective  If you have followed my Facebook page for a while then you may have read this post previously. However in the aftermath of all of the appalling shootings that have occurred in our country sometimes its important to consider the impact that gun violence can cause on those that survive these heinous crimes. Each year in our country approximately 33000 people become gun-violence survivors. Please read this post keeping that in mind. Sometimes we commemorate anniversaries of those occasions that were milestones in our lives however it is equally important to remember and recall horrific transformative events and to celebrate one's survival of those circumstances.  It has now been 33 years and I remember it like if it was yesterday... Exactly 33 years ago today on the evening of December 27 1985 in a matter of minutes my life was changed forever. This painful transformation occurred as a result of being a victim of a senseless violent crime. At that point in my life I was an Attorney with a well-known law firm in Washington DC. However I always had an interest in small business so I purchased a convenience store here in NC on Interstate 85. That evening I gave everybody time off from work and I decided to work alone when shortly after 7 PM two men entered the store. One man went to a cooler to get a soft drink and the other one immediately opened the flap on his overcoat and extended a sawed-off shotgun towards me. I immediately raised my hands and opened the cash register so they could take all the money. They told me to lay on the floor of the store and I hoped that they would just grab my wallet. Instead they began kicking me with their steel toe work boots and one of them said to the other ""shoot him."" We were hardly separated by 2 to 3 feet when I instinctively and intuitively raised my left arm to block the gun from firing into my chest and instead it literally blew off my left arm which was left dangling by less than an inch of flesh as the robbers escaped.  While I was in excruciating pain I knew that to survive I had to place my mind above the pain and I called for help after I locked the door. Blood was everywhere and a portion of my arm that was next to my body immediately began swelling. When I looked at my arm it was like staring at the flesh from the inside of a giant lobster tail that was exposed entirely smothered with blood but in unimaginable pain that I could not focus upon if I wanted to survive. Within 10 minutes a North Carolina Highway Patrolman as I recall his last name was Bennett arrived to provide timely intervention. The officer asked me if I recognized the robbers and I told him no and that they must have driven in off the interstate. He asked me if they were traveling North or South and I answered him I did not know but based on a mere glimpse of the headlights of their car that I thought they might have been driving North on I-85. He asked me what kind of car it was and I told him that they had parked in a remote section of the parking lot so I hadn't seen it but that based on the glimpse of the headlights I had seen I thought that it was a Thunderbird or a Cougar. Both of my hunches were correct and within less than 45 minutes a Virginia Highway Patrolman spotted a car matching my general description and pulled it over in a weight station for trucks north of South Hill VA.  They discovered the men I had described as well as the sawed-off shotgun and the money stolen in the trunk of the car. In the meantime fortunately the Highway Patrolman who assisted me was able to contain some of the bleeding and I was taken by the Rescue Squad to a Hospital in Henderson NC where I was met by my friend and family doctor Dr. J.P. Green who told me that their only option would be to amputate my arm. I merely said to J.P. that night to get me to a doctor who could put arms back on. J.P. could not believe that I was calm and able to communicate nor could anyone else when I got to the emergency room. With the assistance of Dr. Green and my father I eventually got to Duke Medical Center where thanks to the expertise of Dr. Jim Nunley and Dr. Harrelson my arm was saved. It took 6 operations and extensive therapy at Duke and with Ms. Judy Colditz of the Raleigh Hand Rehabilitation Center to regain limited use of my arm and hand. This all took more than a year and a half; however during that period I could not even perform simple daily tasks by myself without great difficulty and frustration if at all. For example it was impossible to tie my shoes; therefore I chose to wear loafers or shoes with Velcro straps. Every pair of pants and even shirts required Velcro if I wanted to function on my own. It was impossible to tie a necktie or to bathe with a bar of soap and when in a restaurant I would always have to ask that my food would be cut in the kitchen since I could not use a knife to cut meats or other food items being served. Due to extensive nerve damage I did not have normal sensation in my arm; therefore I couldn't distinguish between things that were sharp or dull or know just by touch whether something was hot or cold. Some of these challenges I still face today. I once loved to play guitar however that became a cherished distant memory today which I will never again be able to enjoy despite how much I will try. I used to be able to swim approximately 2 miles. Today its challenging to swim 25 feet.  One thing I developed was a great deal of compassion and empathy for those who were impaired more importantly I also found the value of determination to overcome physical disabilities despite the obstacles and the importance of good doctors and good medical insurance coverage. These are values that are near and dear to my heart today. Each time I hear about another senseless random act of violence involving the use of guns and firearms I not only mourn the loss of the lives of innocent people but I also understand and respect the challenges of those that we merely refer to as survivors or those who were wounded.  In the past 10 years more than twice as many people were killed with guns in North Carolina than were killed in combat in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. There are appropriately 33000 people in America each year that will be survivors of incidents involving firearms. As a society we must respect the constitutional rights of people to possess firearms but we must adopt reasonable intelligent regulations and controls that limit the potential misuse and abuse by those who would harm innocent people including children and members of their own family.  That day 33 years ago I had watched the evening news only 30 minutes prior and I was stunned by a senseless terrorist attack at an airport in Rome Italy. At that time I was traveling through a lot of airports on business virtually every week of my life so I thought to myself how horrible it would be to become an innocent victim of an act of violence. Little did I know that less than an hour later I would face the same type of destiny. I did learn that one can overcome challenges and he or she does not have to become a victim. Last year I ran this post on the 32nd anniversary of this horrific incident; however the words thoughts and opinions it expresses are equally relevant today.

"I am re-writing this post and also changing my Challenge to the Socialists/Communists. I gave it some thought this morning after someone said to make it a year. I looked at my finances and budget and decided to make it better.  This is for all of you socialists/communists who want ""others"" to pay more in taxes. You believe so much in your cause right? Here is a chance for you to practice what you preach. I challenge you to write a check to the IRS for 90% of ""your"" income for the entire year of 2019 and if you do so I will do the same. This is only for people who are working in a job that is your livelihood and has a W-2. Let us go to a CPA and let the CPA look into our incomes and verify that we are doing 90% of our income to the IRS.  Of course you need to have a full time job that is your livelihood. If anyone is willing to do that let me know and I will also give up 90% of my income for the entire year of 2019 to the IRS. Chances are the check I would write may be more than what you would write to the IRS but I am willing to do that. Show that you practice what you preach. Show the rest of us that you put your money where your mouth is.  Here it is a promise in writing. I do have a good income in 2019.

"If You Want to Save Lives- Ban Cars Not Guns  There are ""constants"" in the Universe. Gravity is a ""constant"" in the universe. The speed of light is a ""constant"" in the universe. Unfortunately ""Knee-Jerk Reaction"" gun control proposals and arguments after a mass shooting event are also ""constants."" Within the scope of ""Knee-Jerk Reaction"" gun control proposals there are other ""constants"" as well. One of those ""constants"" is that eventually someone will argue ""we make people get licenses and insurance for cars why shouldn't we make people get a license and liability insurance before they can own a gun?""  The fact is the vast majority of those that push for increased gun control have no idea of what current laws already exist the extent of those laws or how they apply to gun ownership or what the process is for purchasing a firearm. A number of those that are ""pro-gun control"" believe that anyone can go to a store and buy ""fully automatic"" firearms over the counter or that one can go to a website pick out a gun type in their credit card number and the gun will just be mailed to them. Many gun control advocates give the impression that a gun show is a ""free-for-all"" full of individuals who could never pass a federal firearm background check and intend to go on a shooting rampage the moment they leave the show. If one listens to some gun-control advocates gun shows exist solely to provide a location to avoid back-ground checks for firearm purchases.  Sadly there are a great many people who listen to these ""pro-gun control"" advocates despite the fact that many of those who are ""pro-gun control"" have limited knowledge of guns at best. The public hear phrases like ""background checks"" ""keep military weapons out of civilian hands"" or ""assault weapons ban"" and cannot help but think the proposals are reasonable.  Perhaps the best way to show why some of these proposals are unreasonable is to compare guns and automobiles. Let's take current gun control proposals and laws and see what they look like when applied to automobile ownership operation and licensing:  1. We must ban all Jeeps and Hummers- they have a military appearance and we can't have that. A military appearance makes things more dangerous. Suburbans and other quasi-military looking vehicles also should be restricted.  Firearms reality: Many so called ""assault weapons bans"" restrict the sale and ownership of a firearm simply because of the ""looks"" of the gun. These laws may ban one firearm but say another is a ""common hunting firearm"" and therefore permissible to own in the view of some gun control advocates. This despite the fact that both of the firearms use the same caliber of round (bullets) and both are semi-automatic. It should not be a valid reason to ban a firearm because it ""looks scary""  2. All vehicles must be limited to a tank quantity of less than 10 gallons. That way you can't drive as much. You must stop to reload (the tank) more often.  Firearms reality: A constant proposal from gun control advocates is limiting the size of firearm magazines (incorrectly often referred to as ""clips""). If I am in a situation where I have to use my firearm to defend my life or the life of another I don't want to run out of ammunition (personally I am a decent shot so I might not run out of ammo but there may be others who don't shoot as well). Another reason why a person may wish to have a high-capacity magazine may be that a person might not want to spend all their time at the shooting range re-loading. The ""gun-control advocate"" view is that no one needs more than eight to ten rounds of ammo. That view is false.  3. We must place an breathalyzer interlock on ALL cars and trucks- regardless of whether the person had ever had a DUI- they might try sometime even if they NEVER drink.  Firearms reality: I have lost track of the number of times when a certain firearm is used in a crime and ""gun-control advocates"" immediately want to ban everyone from having that type firearm. The criminal actions of a single individual should never dictate the rights of millions of law abiding citizens.  4. All states should adopt ""MAY ISSUE"" laws instead of SHALL ISSUE. It should be up to the whim of local sheriffs to decide who gets to drive and who doesn't. With the Shall Issue law if a person passes the Drivers License test and has a clean record the state MUST issue a drivers license. Obviously this is bad.  Firearms reality: There are nine states with either strict or partial ""may issue"" concealed weapons permit laws. The most egregious jurisdiction in the eyes of many is San Diego County. It is nearly impossible to obtain a concealed weapons permit in San Diego County. The San Diego County Sheriff's website states that to obtain a Concealed Carry Weapon Permit you must demonstrate ""a set of circumstances that distinguishes the applicant from other members of the general public and causes him or her to be placed in harms way. Simply writing ""self defense"" or ""personal protection"" on an application does not provide the requisite proof of good cause."" Other jurisdictions such as the District of Columbia have been told by the United States Court of Appeals that a nearly identical ""good cause"" requirement is unconstitutional. This issue has yet to be heard by the United States Supreme Court. Rulings from the Court of Appeals only apply to those places where the individual court has jurisdiction.  5. One state should not be required to accept another's Drivers License. Places like New York California DC etc should be allowed to ban drivers from other states from driving in their states. To hell with the fact that the Supreme Court has ruled that interstate travel is a right.  Firearms reality: Although most states accept the Concealed Carry permit of other states places like California do not. In fact because California does not allow for the open carry of firearms and in California only a California resident may obtain a Concealed Carry permit it is in effect illegal for a non-resident to carry a firearm. The general belief of the public is the Constitution guarantees the right to keep and bear arms. The United States Supreme Court has never ruled on this issue. Therefore for now at least in California the Second Amendment does not apply to those who are from any of the other 49 states.  6. All automobile purchasers should be required to have a background check-- UNIVERSAL Background Checks- even in the case of someone being willed grandfather's old car. The person buying could have a background of speeding or DUI  Firearms reality: Every firearms sale through a firearms dealer requires a background check by Federal law. The information from the purchaser is run through NICS (National Instant Criminal Background Check System). This also includes sales from dealers at gun shows as well as so called internet sales. The fact is ""internet sales"" don't really happen. A person may go to a website such as Gunbroker to purchase a firearm but the firearm does not go to the purchaser directly. The firearm gets transferred to a licensed firearm dealer. That dealer then performs all required background checks as well as any required state checks. This also is a check against violation of state law in that if the firearm is illegal in the state of purchase the transfer to the purchaser does not take place. The gun control lobby seeks to expand background checks past this point. Under the ""pro-gun control"" proposals if I were to purchase a firearm as a gift for my spouse (I have done this on several occasions and the ""gift"" is greatly appreciated) not only would a background check be performed on me as the purchaser but then my spouse would have to go to the store and have a background check run as well. This is an inconvenience with little gain. Background checks do not stop crime. Career criminals generally do not go to gun stores to purchase a gun before committing a crime- they get those guns on the street or by theft.  7. Ban the private sale or transfer of autos and all internet sales. The person buying the car MUST have a background check. This includes all ""car shows"" - OK so even though all car dealers at car shows may be licensed dealers AND they would already do a background check who cares. You can buy parts at shows and that means a bad driver ""could"" get a hold of a car at a show.  Firearms reality: There are proposals to ban the private ""transfer"" of firearms. This would include firearms transferred by Will and Testament. As already discussed these type checks do nothing to stop crime. These checks are about tracking who owns what guns.  8. Require a background check for the purchase of gasoline at the state level. Allow for an ""instant check"" for those who have bought a car in the last year (will help speed up gasoline sales). However individuals who have not purchased a car in the last year will have to wait until they are ""in the system"" before a gasoline purchase can be approved. Additionally out of state visitors will be unable to purchase gasoline.  Firearms reality: California has enacted a background check requirement ammunition purchases. The only persons approved immediately are those who have purchased a firearm since the state started tracking purchases. The state wants to be sure you only buy ammunition for a gun you personally own. If you haven't made a recent firearm purchase you must wait for processing to be completed on your application before the state will approve your ammunition purchase. If you are not a California resident you would not have a firearm purchase registered with the California system and therefore you would not be able to purchase ammunition. For those who believe that people from outside of California would have no need to purchase ammunition there are people who travel to California to compete in shooting competitions. There are also those who travel to California to hunt. Regardless of the reason these restrictions are unreasonable and have been challenged in Federal Court. To date this law has yet to be reviewed by any court higher than Federal District Court- however the Federal Judge has stated he believes these laws will be found to be unconstitutional but there currently is no injunction in place and the ammo purchase laws are in effect.  9. We must limit AAA. The problem is they are to powerful. EVERY TIME a multiple vehicle accident occurs it is because of their members and the lobbying power they have. If it wasn't for their political influence and stranglehold on Congress and State Legislative bodies there would not be such a problem.  Firearms reality: The media and politicians love to paint the National Rifle Association an enemy of civilization. They paint the NRA as an organization that actively tries to recruit people to carry out mass murders. The fact is the NRA has been around since the 1870's. And while the NRA does lobby on behalf of gun owners for ""reasonable"" laws the primary task the NRA performs is education. The NRA provides safety training. The NRA provides training for Range Officers and provides standards for firing range safety. Millions have been taught firearms safety through courses taught by the NRA or using NRA approved curriculum.  10. A 5 day waiting period on all car sales.  Firearms reality: As much as some politicians like to talk about how anyone can walk into a gun store put down a credit card and walk out with a gun every gun sale from a firearms dealer does require a background check that may end up requiring a waiting period. Unless a firearms dealer is told to ""proceed"" with a firearms sale and assuming there has not been a ""denied"" issued a firearm sale is subject to a hold.  These are just a few examples of what gun control advocates call ""reasonable"" proposals. However the public would be furious if for example a drunk driver hit a school bus killing several students and then politicians started shouting that we need a law to require Breathalyzer Ignition Interlocks on every single vehicle sold. Rightfully the general public would be outraged and stress that just because one person got drunk and used their car to cause a tragedy the rest of the driving population should not be punished. However the same general public is not concerned when politicians discuss banning a firearm from millions because one ""nut"" decided to use that weapon in a murder. The People would be outraged over restrictions to the purchases of automobiles yet driving is not a Constitutional Right; keeping and bearing a firearm is.  **** To be sure you see the latest discussion and commentary please follow Carden Chronicles on Facebook Twitter (@CardenBlog) or subscribe to email or RSS Feed updates at The Carden Chronicles website. ****  The Carden Chronicles is against the #GunControlNow Campaign  #2A #NRA #NRAILA #GoodGuyWithGun",political,Facebook

"Let it be on record that President Donald TRUMP is a TRAITOR to the American Veterans and to the American Soldiers because he did the unthinkable but if you understand him well it is his usual behavior which is being a piece of garbage. Here is what he did as reported by a White House statement.  Trumps cancel American cemetery visit  US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump will not visit the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery and Memorial on Saturday afternoon as planned because of poor weather.  A White House statement said the planned visit had been ""canceled due to scheduling and logistical difficulties caused by the weather. An American delegation led by Chief of Staff General John Kelly and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joe Dunford will attend on their behalf. Yes there is no way around calling President Trump a piece of Garbage and a Traitor to our soldiers who are my heroes and your heroes. Note that his chief of Staff John Kelly and an American delegation was very easily able to go and pay their respect to our fallen heroes. The American cemetery was only 55 miles away from Paris about one hour drive for a speedy official car led by police on motorcycles. World war I was an horrible war for our soldiers living in trenches and yes it is unbelievable charging without any protection the machine guns firing at them and the commemoration of the sacrifice of these heroes by the President of the USA was to stay warm and cosy in a very comfortable residence in Paris. Donald Trump you really are a traitor to our veterans and to our soldiers to our heroes to our military and a piece of garbage. Eric Lafayette Nov 10 2018",political,Facebook

"THE THINGS YOU WILL HARDLY EVER KNOW UNLESS YOU ARE KEEN ENOUGH TO DIG DEEP FOR TRUTHS: Part one of many.  THIS COLUMN IS PRIMARILY WRITTEN FOR THE EDIFICATION OF PEOPLE OF ALL RACES ETHNICITIES NATIONALITES AND RELIGIONS WHO LIVE IN THE USA (the United States of Amnesia); AND WHO PERPETUALLY DENY RACISM'S VICIOUS OCTOPUSSIAN TENTACLES. (My thanks to the Knowledge Ark LLC and Wikipedia: amongst other sources). THE KISSING CASE.  On October 28 1958 two black boys (7-year-old James Hanover Thompson and 9-year-old David ""Fuzzy"" Simpson) were among a group of children in Monroe North Carolina simply playing -as young children usually did back then on cool autumn days. Their playful involvement was without much pattern or apparent direction. Most of the children were white. The ages ranged from six to ten. They were unsupervised at the time. Some people have questioned why black and white kids were allowed to play unsupervised in an era of racial segregation: such as it was back then. The answer is simple. In those days many blacks (of both genders) were employed by whites as nannies servants house-keepers gardeners laborers farm-workers and such. These blacks often brought their kids to work; especially in places where there were no exclusively-black-school-facilities to send them to. Inevitably black and white kids ended up playing together.  During the childrens play-time that day one of the white girls (Sissy Sutton) kissed James Hanover on the cheek. Later Sissys mother overheard her relaying that apparent event -as the days highlight- to one of her sisters. The woman was irate. She became so livid when she heard about the kissing part that she assembled the parents of the other white kids who were there. Just the idea of a white girl playfully kissing a black boy incensed the parents to such a point that they actually armed themselves and eventually gathered as a group. A little while later they went looking for either the boys or their parents.  The woman (Mrs. Sutton) carried her posse to Hanovers home seeking some sort of visceral reprisal. They arrived almost at the identical time that six carloads of policemen -representative of almost the entire police force of Monroe- got there. Fortunately no one was at home.  Later that evening a squad car spotted the two boys pulling a little red wagon filled with soda-pop bottles. Back then empty soda-pop bottles were returnable for pennies. The police officers jumped from the car with guns drawn. They snatched the boys and handcuffed them. After throwing them into the car Hanover was slapped around by one of the white cops. It was the first of many beatings he would endure. When they got to the jail both boys were further beaten. They were held without counsel for days unending. Neither their parents relatives nor friends were allowed to see them.  The black parents were so frightened that they didnt sleep in their own homes. Anonymous gunmen -in passing cars- fired dozens of gunshots into the Thompson home; they even killed Hanovers dog. The mothers of both these boys were eventually fired from their jobs as housekeepers/servants. They had been employed by white families in the area for years. Mrs. Thompson was later forcibly evicted from her home.  The Klu Klux Klan held daily demonstrations outside of the jail. The KKK was all over this issue: like white on rice. Blacks who lived in the town of Monroe faced terror and intimidation throughout this incident. Many of them relocated; never to return.  On November 4 1958 six days after taking the boys into custody local authorities finally held a hearing. The boys had still not seen their parents friends or legal counsel from the day of the incident. All during this time they were locked up in an adult jail. At the hearing the Caucasian judge found the boys guilty of three charges of assault (kissing) and molestation. He ordered that the boys be incarcerated in an adult facility for prisoners and told them that if they behaved they might be released at age 21.  The states regional NAACP director didnt want anything to do with the 'sex case' as he called it. Roy Wilkins of the national NAACP also declined to get involved. Eventually it was the communists who had to step in while hoping to restore some semblance of sanity to the situation. Members of the Socialist Workers-Party came to the rescue. They did everything they could to publicize what was happening in Monroe. Although the former first lady of the USA (Eleanor Roosevelt) tried to intervene with the governor and state officials it eventually took foreign media to lift these events to the proper level of public attention and scrutiny it deserved.  Joyce Egginton a reporter for the London News-Chronicle traveled from England to North Carolina. She sneaked in the prison at Monroe posing as a social-worker. She also sneaked in a camera and took pictures of the conditions under which the boys were being jailed.  Ten days before Christmas of 1958 a front-page picture of Hanover and Fuzzy in the reformatory -along with an article about the issues at hand- appeared in many newspapers all over Europe. News organizations in England Germany Italy France Belgium and Spain highlighted and continuously carried stories of this incident. The United States Information Agency (USIA) received more than 12000 letters expressing outrage at the events. An international committee was formed in Europe to raise money and defend Thompson and Simpson. Huge demonstrations were held in Paris Rome Vienna and Rotterdam. Protesters railed against the United States and its inhumane racial practices and policies. The U.S. Embassy in Brussels was stoned. It was an nothing less than an international embarrassment for the U.S. government.  In reality this was just one of the many thousands of everyday racial-incidents that get swept under the rug. This one didn't only because of the international public outcry; but the reality is that everyday in the USA non-whites suffer the stings stabs and scars of blatant and clandestine white-racism. This has been happening since the Mayflower landed.  In February of 1959 North Carolinian officials asked the black mothers to sign a waiver as a pre-condition to a release of the kids. The mothers refused to sign the waiver which would have required the boys admitting guilt to the charges laid. Two days after their refusal -after the boys had spent three months in detention- the governor surprisingly pardoned both Thompson and Simpson with no pre-conditions (or post-conditions) whatsoever. No public official-explanation of this event was ever given. Neither state nor city ever publicly apologized to the boys or their relatives for the gross and unjust treatment they had received. There is no public record of any kind of civil-action undertaken in this matter.  Look; undeniably there are millions of sordid stories in this countrys racial past: this was just one of them. Do remember that when people forget (or ignore) the lessons of the past they are apt to repeat both its mistakes and horrors. In the meantime journalists like myself could only warn of the fire(s) next time around.  In this event -about which I just wrote- these kids escaped being lynched by the skin of their pre-pubescent teeth. And yet today -59 years later- these types of stories still play-out in a variety of strange forms ways and shapes. Pre-teenagers like Hanover and Fuzzy are now embodied in dead young men like Trayvon Martin Amadou Diallo Sean Bell and Michael Brown. And towns like Monroe in North Carolina have given way to big cities like New York and Los Angeles. In small towns all across the USA blacks still await profound legal decisions and just policy-changes from authority-figures who are still predominantly white. Dare I ask it again: despite the many changes in this country over time arent we still more or less the same?  Stay tuned-in folks: amnesia is alive and thriving.  **************************************************************************",political,Facebook
The Fruits of Greed and Pretension - Charlie's Soapbox 1/28/19  John Steinbecks classic novel The Grapes of Wrath depicts the plight of a people who were deceived and exploited used to create an atmosphere favoring the rich and powerful and a credible analogy can be drawn between those times and a situation that exists today.  In the early 1930s the continuous windstorms in Oklahoma blew away the topsoil on what had once been arable productive land and they became barren fields unfit for farming creating a massive exodus of people to California where the fruit growers had put out the word that there was plentiful work for good wages.  Actually there was ample work but the caravans of jalopies loaded with people and possessions headed for the promised land had the desired effect and exponentially inflated the labor force reducing the wages the growers had to pay to have their fruit harvested to pennies making the fruit growers richer but reducing families of migrants to existing any way they could living hand to mouth constantly on the edge of starvation.  It was a deplorable situation a true example of greed of choosing exceptional profit over the welfare of mankind an intentional flooding of the labor market that forced desperate people to work for a pittance and if they werent willing to work for what the growers offered there were plenty of destitute people who were.  Does anybody think that Gavin Newsome is declaring California a sanctuary state out of the compassion in his heart for migrants the same heart that doesnt give a second thought to the murder of thousands of unborn babies in his state every year?  Look into the eyes of Chuck Schumer do you see the kind of compassion that says I support open borders because I have a deep love for my fellow man and want them to have a chance at the American dream?  Do Nancy Pelosis disjointed diatribes really reflect a heart overflowing with pity and empathy for the people who brave death rape and being sold into the nightmare of human trafficking to get into America?  Gavin Newsome Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi as we used to say down home have got theirs their financial future is secure and as far as the rest of us are concerned its root hog or die even if your boss walks up one day and says Im really sorry I know youve been with us for twenty years but weve found workers who are willing to do your job for half of what were paying you so long.  People please stop and seriously think about this all Pelosi Schumer Newsome et al. are interested in is an unbeatable democrat voter base and giving their major contributors and influential supporters who run major businesses an inflated labor pool to keep the costs low and the profits high.  I ask you what is the difference in these people and the greedy California fruit growers of the thirties who attracted thousands more workers than they could possibly employ just so they could profit causing human suffering on a grand scale.  Well theyre all dead and gone now and what good did it do them?  The Democratic leaders state and federal feign compassion and charity but these people are one-eyed jacks and if you could see the hidden side of their faces you would see much fewer noble purposes selfish reasons the lust for power control over the lives of other people and he the accursed dark political ambitions that haunt the professional politician.  While the old guard and their compatriots try to force their intentions on America the party they champion is in the process of dumping the likes of Pelosi and Schumer as the young guns of socialism have become the new media darlings getting most of the favorable sound bites and interviews a situation of their own making that is rapidly slipping out of their control as the progressive wing of the party all try to out-promise each other.  So - though it will take a while - the old guards days are numbered and if - God forbid - the situation they are trying to create ever happens it will benefit the new Democrats not the undertaker types like Chuck Schumer or the Flub-A-Dub personalities of the Nancy Pelosis but the new fresh-faced radicals who will promise the moon and deliver misery.  Either way the faces may change but the political ends dont.  Buckle up patriots its going to be a rough ride.  What do you think?  Pray for our troops our police and the peace of Jerusalem.

How Gun Control Advocates and Media Are Making Things Worse  This morning I heard two [deceptive] facts on the news. Some 40000 people are killed a year in what was termed as gun violence and there have been 54 mass shootings so far this MONTH. Perhaps a better way to state what was heard was that it was propaganda being spread by the mass media. This propaganda being spread by gun control groups and the media is making matters worse when it comes to violence with firearms.  Is there gun violence in the US? Of course there is. Is any innocent life taken or any injury to an innocent person horrific and a tragedy? Absolutely. Do we as a nation need solutions to the problems? Again of course we do. However the alleged facts [actually propaganda] being pushed by people like David Hogg Michael Bloomberg former Rep Gabrielle Giffords and her husband Senator Mark Kelly are at best distorting the truth. More likely the propaganda they are spreading will cause harm and make matters worse.  The numbers the gun control crowd throw around (and the same numbers the media repeat without question) do not tell the full story. When the gun control crowd and the media say there have been 54 mass shootings this MONTH they paint a picture for the general public of 54 Columbines or 54 events like we just saw in Indianapolis. The public would be surprised to learn that the 54 includes gang drive-bys where multiple people are wounded. This number includes a felon in a stand-off with police in his home where the felon wounded a couple police officers and was then killed by officers returning fire. The number includes a parent who killed their family and then themselves (a family annihilator). In fact the number includes any situation where a gun is fired and three or more persons are wounded including the shooter. This however is NOT the definition used by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) definition is a multitude homicide incident in which four or more victims are murdered with firearms -not including the offenders- within one event...in public locations... not attributable to any other underlying criminal activity. By using the CRS definition there have been about 8 mass shooting incidents per year between 2017-2020 and 3 this year. Although even one event is abhorrent there CERTAINLY a were NOT 54 THIS MONTH!  The other big number thrown around is 40000 people killed in gun violence. HOWEVER according to the FBIs Uniform Crime Reporting Program database homicide data for the last fully reported year (2019) there were 10258 homicides with firearms down from a five year period high of 11014 in 2017. Why the huge disparity? The gun control groups (and media who are repeating these numbers) are including every accidental firearm discharge as well as suicides and LAWFUL firearm usage- or in other words self defense and lawful use of force.  Why does it matter what numbers are used? For gun control groups the use of these numbers is intended to portray to the public a much larger problem than what actually exists to push through their agenda. The gun control groups are not technically lying but they are spinning deceptive numbers to try to convince the public - through inference at minimum- that their proposed solutions are the ones that should be implemented. They want to ban so-called assault rifles despite the fact that true assault rifles are almost NEVER used in a crime (finding the exact date an assault rifle - one capable of bursts of fully automatic fire at minimum- was used in a crime is difficult. Homicides with ANY type of rifle accounted for 364 homicides in 2019. On average over the last five years there have been 315 homicides a year with ALL rifles. An assault weapons ban would have a negligible effect on homicide since over the last five years rifles accounted for less than 2.2% of homicides  Further by lumping suicide accidents and homicides together the gun control groups and media distract from the REAL problems and REAL solutions that may found in favor of the illusions of expanded background checks weapon bans etc. Suicide is a mental health issue- NOT a firearm issue. Japan has an incredibly high suicide rate despite banning firearms since the 1970s. They CLEARLY prove that a person does not need a gun to commit suicide AND prove that a person who definitely wants to commit suicide WILL find a way - even without a gun. Therefore the solution is in mental health not in gun control.  Gang violence will also not be solved by any type of weapons ban or increased background checks. Criminal gangs get their firearms by theft and background checks do not stop theft. Gang problems occur because of drugs and poverty and no gun control proposal addresses those issues.  Firearms deaths from accidents are very often preventable. Firearms Safety Education goes a very long way to helping reduce accidents. Instead of banning guns we should be teaching how to handle them safely.  There are real solutions to violence- regardless of the weapon used. But those solutions will NEVER be found with gun control groups and the media spreading propaganda that distracts from the real problems. We NEED mental health care reform in this country. We NEED to better address the poverty and other issues that drive gangs and drugs. We NEED Firearms Safety Education- like the classes the NRA has been providing for decades and decades. But as long as we allow the media and gun control groups to keep push propaganda for the sake of an agenda people will needlessly die because the public has been distracted from the real problems and real solutions.  **** To be sure you see the latest discussion and commentary please follow Carden Chronicles on Facebook Twitter (@CardenBlog) or subscribe to email or RSS Feed updates at The Carden Chronicles website. ****  The Carden Chronicles is against the #GunControlNow Campaign  #2A #NRA #NRAILA #GoodGuyWithGun,political,Facebook

Now this from the common tarry  With the arrest of the McAlester girl on Monday who allegedly had planned to shoot up the McAlester High School and was reported to have purchased guns to do so the irresponsibility of one national news network cannot be overlooked.. And who knows how many other news outlets acted as foolishly?  After past mass shootings there have always been those who have rightly said that there is certain to be people to whom the shooters divulged their plans and there is always great wondering and rightly so as to why no one ever steps forth and warn about such things! Well dont we now know when a national news organization doesnt think twice about endangering the lives of others!  ABC News in reporting the alleged plan last night said that the tip came from a co-worker of the arrested person and they even showed a picture of the business where they worked! That is going as far as possibly identifying the person who tipped authorities at least to people who frequent the business or others who work there! But absent anyone being able to know precisely who it was what kind of danger does it pose to a business and all who work there should there have been an accomplice to a planned attack? There shouldnt be anyone reporting news who isnt smart enough to realize the danger theyre subjecting others to!  Such pinpointing of where a tip came from does nothing to encourage people to come forward and tell about planned attacks! It is as irresponsible as any person or organization can get.!  If I worked at such place of business as ABC identified or was the owner of such business I would be seeing a good lawyer for the extreme undue stress that ABC is sure to have put on all of them. Well how about a class action lawsuit by the business its employeesour school and the city of McAlester?

The dangers of ghost guns are very real and Delaware lawmakers are stepping up to take action.  Ghost guns are often homemade (assembled 3D printed) weapons. Many lack serial numbers. These firearms sidestep background check laws allowing people prohibited to obtain a gun.

Troubling times are coming; big tech exerts its power for Social Progress based on viewpoint and politics. Soon I see a world where firearms manufacturers pro-life groups and even religious organizations will not have access to modern cloud platforms and technology limiting their reach.  Every Christian value now is considered hate speech and even acknowledging reality is problematic. Guns are evil and must be censored; stating your own opinion can get you banned from social media or canceled from everything.  Thats why I founded Goliad Technologies; a non-profit focused on providing a neutral platform to controversial organizations so another Parlor GAB Trump or Minds does not happen again. Our goal is to create a small but advanced cloud platform a genuinely non-partisan web host of last resort that will benefit charities religious organizations schools and viewpoint discrimination victims. We will also research to expose big techs hypocrisy and study ways to get around big techs walled garden censorship. We believe our charitable work will allow all organizations to have the confidence to speak their mind without fear of being shut down. Cancel culture needs to end and I believe my organization can help stop it but we need the communitys help to follow and donate.

Erin Tobin doesn't care if children are killing children  On October 3 2015 11-year old Benjamin Tiller grabbed his father's loaded shotgun out of an unlocked closet and shot 8-year old MaKayla Dyer in the heart just because she refused to let him play with her new puppy. Between September 1 2014 and September 1 2016 a child under the age of 13 was the perpetrator in at least 300 acts of gun violence resulting in 102 deaths and 198 injuries. On its website the NRA states In a home where guns are kept the degree of safety a child has rests squarely on the parents and gun owner. But the NRA heavily lobbied the Tennessee legislature against adopting a new law mandating safe storage.  Erin Tobin doesn't want common sense gun regulations and she doesn't want to do anything to prevent these kind of killings from happening. I bet if MaKayla Dyer had been Erin Tobin's daughter then Erin would feel differently.  Erin Tobin is more interested in getting elected than in doing what is best for South Dakota and America.

From the Executive Director May 3 2019  Our society has two painful realities that increasingly intersect each other. They are hate and gun violence. So very often people whose minds are clouded by an unfiltered and disturbing agenda of hate choose to express themselves violently through the use of firearms. The most recent example of this evil entanglement was the Poway synagogue shootings on April 27th that left one dead and three wounded.  By now we know that there are no easy or quick solutions to the complex problems of hate and gun violence. Perhaps it is this reality coupled with the fact that such shootings are occurring more frequently that has led so many to believe hate based on race religion sexual orientation or gender identification and gun violence are inevitable and therefore unpreventable.  This widespread belief raises a theological question for the church. Do we believe that hate and gun violence which separately and together seek to deny God-given human dignity and cancel lives crafted in the image and likeness of God are inescapable realities that are out of the reach of Gods transformative love?  Somehow even with tears in our eyes we believe that Gods love has the power to overcome hate and gun violence. We believe that in an age of irrational hate with an epidemic of gun violence Gods love calls us to do something!  Scores of us have participated in anti-racism/anti-oppression trainings and have boldly made public our Christian faith-based narratives on the power of Gods love and its requirement that we love our neighbors with the same intensity and intentionality through which we love ourselves.  This love calls for us do something! To dismantle instruments designed for evil while establishing instruments designed for good.  After all we are people who just days ago celebrated the Resurrection of Jesus Christ our Savior. The Resurrection just has to mean something for us on earth and not just in the heavenly realmit just has to.  It was with tears in my own eyes that I recently took part in a national tour focusing on beating guns into actual garden tools. (Isaiah 2:4) Some of you saw this on Facebook. Led by Shane Claiborne and Michael Martin this tour featured testimonials from people whose lives had been impacted by gun violence.  I was among those who gave testimony as 22 years ago my 21-year-old sister Jennifer was shot to death in Cleveland. However the event featured more than speeches.  During several dramatic moments gun barrels made pliable by flames in an oven were beaten into garden tools by participants. How healing it was for me to lift a hammer and pound an instrument created for killing and maiming into a tool that could give life. I will never forget that moment.  I would like to know what Gods love and Resurrection power are leading you to do and what you believe we all can do together to erase hate and gun violence. Please send your thoughts to me at info@ohcouncilchs.org.  Just so you know I am interested in visiting your church events and functions. Please let me know what you are doing and how I might be able to offer support on behalf of the OCC.  As always I will be praying for you as the weekend unfolds.

Hello  I am Thomas Norton. I am running for Congress in Michigans Third District.  In 1964 Ronald Reagan spoke of A Time for Choosing. Well this is our time. It is time we choose to be strong on immigration. Its time to choose strong borders. Michigan is the home of Gerald R. Ford and Paul Henry two amazing public servants. Two men who had our backs. It is time again for someone who is strong on crime strong on life and who will stand strong for our American Veterans.  In fact Jerry Ford is the reason I am a Republican. When I was 14 years old I participated in union civil war reenactments. The Ford Museum didnt want us to bring our guns. So I wrote a letter to Gerald R. Ford and my mother faxed it to the Secret Service. We were just a poor farm family yet to our surprise someone listening called the museum and we were able to do the reenactment with our guns. Jerry Ford had my back even as a Fourteen-year-old patriot. He continued to have our backs when he left office. I admire that strength.  I am a family man. My wife Jami and I have three children aged 10 9 and 7. I am a veteran of the Afghan War and have stood with my fellow veterans since we have returned. I have focused on suicide prevention leading an American Legion post to greater growth and helping to found the West Michigan Veterans Ranch. I have their backs and they have mine.  The line has been drawn in the sand. It is our time to choose and the choice is clear. We wont surrender our allies our borders or our rights as citizens to non-legal residents. We need a wall to stop drugs from coming across our borders. Our benefits as citizens must go to Americans first. We must show courage for our allies and the Red white and blue.  I am Tom Norton. Our time for choosing is here. It is time for us to stand strong for our district and America. Our country is great her best days are ahead of not behind her. Ive got your back. Together we can stand strong for America and have hers.  If you do click our link to Donate,political,Facebook
Free people keep governments in check by maintaining their right to keep and bear arms. This bothers those who wish to be governed by elites  they rally in the streets and cry out for more sweet bread and to be ruled; Rule us rule us they sing in discordant harmony. We want a Ruler a King to make our choices for us. We want to be fat dumb and happy and we dont want to be bothered with personal decisions that draw us anywhere near the white-hot smelter that forces the dross out of our lackluster souls. We dont wish to shine as individuals  we want to dine like hogs at the trough and screw like dogs in the alley.  Thank goodness there is no place in this modern world for free-thinking individuals; take their guns away take their words away and well take all of them and their selfish independent-minded family away.  We have to make room for the coming ant-christ.  Excerpt from Jimahnizums  2021 JA Anderberg,political,Facebook
"I am running for Parish Council district 3 because we need a voice of liberty on our Council. District 3 voters please take the time to learn what I stand for along with your other 2 candidates so that you can make an informed decision on October 12. There is a map of district 3 in the comments if you arent sure or you can look up your districts at https://voterportal.sos.la.gov/Home/VoterLogin (note: Parish Council is listed here as ""Police Jury"").  Some highlights of where I stand on common questions:   My one and only agenda is protecting your rights.   I believe the job of the government at all levels is to protect the rights of its people not tell them how to live (YOUR opinion of what is right for you and your family is the only one that matters).   I believe that the government should not impose unnecessary red tape fees delays or other barriers on doing business except when absolutely necessary to protect the rights of its citizens. For example property developers should be able to build what the market wants while being held accountable for any drainage road sewerage system or other impacts to surrounding property owners as part of the construction process.   Many people claim to be conservative but then are quick to spend our money and ask us for more. I am a true fiscal conservative which means I dont want to spend your money. Spending taxpayer money should be the last resort not the go-to solution. I absolutely will not vote in favor of asking the taxpayers for ANY more money.   I am a bible-believing Christian and I believe in the separation of church and state because if we charge our government schools with teaching our children religion and morality we risk the wrong people getting in power in the future which is far more dangerous.   I oppose Common Core and other ways that our government schools indoctrinate our children. In a perfect world I believe the competitive private sector would do a better job handling public education and give teachers and parents more control over the process but I understand that we are a long way from that. As the mother of 3 children ages 8  17 who have and are still going through the Livingston Parish public school system I believe Livingston Parish has some of the best schools in the state. I believe that good teachers and parental involvement are critical to a good education in any school.   I believe in our constitutional right to bear arms without permission and that the Second Amendment should serve as our concealed carry permit. It is already against the law to shoot people with guns.   I oppose government-run welfare and other government-funded social programs and support private charity and the non-profit sector as better solutions to these needs. I believe that people will come together and create solutions when there is a true need.   I am an animal lover and support non-profit animal rescue and welfare organizations. However I do not believe government-run animal control is the most effective solution to this problem. I believe that individuals coming together to start a non-profit animal control program in our parish would be far more effective. There are private grants available for this type of organization (i.e.: ) and I would like to encourage animal lovers in our community to work on a solution without waiting on the government to do it for us. Id love to join in.   I believe that no person should be treated any differently because of race gender sexual orientation religion the country from which they legally came or any other criteria people often use to discriminate. What is under a persons clothing is not the governments business and any governmental function that determines how it treats people based on gender should be removed. In addition the government has no business in regulating marriages of any kind between consenting adults.",political,Facebook
"Dear Governor Mills  I would like to begin this letter by sincerely thanking you for responding to my previous letter regarding the concern of many in Maine regarding out of state visitors retreating to their vacation homes. As an example of what many in Maine are concerned about I would encourage you to look at what is going on in Sun Valley Idaho.  I am writing to bring your attention to a new concern that I have recently become aware of which is the closure of gun stores as non-essential businesses under your executive order related to the COVID-19 state of emergency.  I am concerned that your interpretation of gun stores as ""nonessential business"" is directly in violation of 25 MRSA 2011 5 A (1) which only allows closure ""...if an authorized person has ordered an evacuation or general closure of businesses in the area...""  I would like to politely ask you to reconsider your decision to close stores that exclusively sell guns and/or ammunition under your State of Emergency declaration.  Sincerely Sam Katz  Chair Dover-Foxcroft Republican Committee",political,Facebook
"Today was the final day of the 2019 legislative session. We set out with an ambitious agenda and I'm incredibly proud of all that we've accomplished for Coloradans over the past 120 days. Here are a few of the biggest achievements:  Energy & Climate  We passed the largest reforms to oil and gas regulation in over 60 years.  We put Colorado on a path to reduce carbon emissions by 90% by 2050.  We've required state agencies to collect comprehensive climate change data.  We're dramatically expanding the use of renewable energy and accounting for the cost of carbon in utility planning.  We're making it more economical for utilities to retire their carbon plants.  We extended the electric vehicle tax credit and expanded infrastructure for electric vehicles.  We passed stricter water quality standards to protect against the impacts of mining.  Civil & Human Rights  We restored the right to vote to thousands of Coloradans on parole.  We FINALLY put an end to gay conversion therapy for minors.  We created a method to temporarily remove guns from those deemed at risk to themselves or others through Extreme Risk Protection Orders.  We eliminated barriers to mental health services for youth to reduce suicide rates.  We created automatic voter registration and the increased access to our elections.  We ""banned the box"" on college and job applications (institutions can no longer ask about criminal history).  We made it easier for transgender Coloradans to get a new birth certificate.  We strengthened protections for undocumented immigrants against deportation.  We strengthened provisions in the Colorado Consumer Protection Act.  We added Colorado to the National Popular Vote Compact to ensure that every American has an equal voice in our presidential elections.  We eliminated monetary bail requirements for petty offenses.  We reduced the penalties for possession of drugs from a felony to a misdemeanor.  Health Care  We enacted a reinsurance bill which will assist health insurers in paying high-cost insurance claims. By reducing system-wide costs and paying for a portion of high-cost claims we can reduce premiums for all Coloradans.  We've increased transparency regarding medical billing to protect consumers from things like surprise bills from out of network providers.  We increased access to programs and services for those in need of treatment for opioid and substance use disorders.  We expanded dental services to pregnant women covered under the childrens basic health plan.  We've authorized the state to investigate a public health care option for all Coloradans.  Weve authorized a pilot program for cooperative medical insurance programs in rural areas.  We created the Office of Saving People Money on Healthcare.  We've authorized the state to import prescription drugs from Canada which will increase cost savings for Colorado consumers.  Education  We created free full-day kindergarten for every family in Colorado.  All sex-ed classes taught in Colorado will be comprehensive and include teaching consent.  We're creating a college savings account with $100 for every child born in Colorado.  We're cracking down on predatory student loan servicers.  We increased awareness of public student loan forgiveness programs.  We kept tuition stable for Colorado universities next year.  We took meaningful steps to lower instances of sexual assault on college campuses and support victims.  We've increased the number of stipends available to teachers who choose to teach in rural school districts where there is a teacher shortage.  Students will have the opportunity to learn more about the history culture and social contributions of American minorities as part of their civil government education.  We've made improvements to the READ Act which will help schools improve teaching methods and increase the number of students reading at grade level.  Economic Security  We implemented a plan to create paid family leave for all Colorado workers.  We're helping ensure all women receive equal pay for equal work.  We're investigating how to expand access to retirement options for all Coloradans.  We are allowing local governments to increase their minimum wage if they choose.  We passed a much-needed enforcement mechanism for violations of the Mobile Home Park Act protecting mobile home owners from abuses by park owners.  We're developing a strategic action plan to address the child care shortage in Colorado.  We expanded penalties for employers who fail to pay proper wages.  We strengthened protections for renters and created an eviction legal defense fund.",political,Facebook
"We have quite a few high school and college interns working on our campaign (you can sign up too at www.eladgross.org/intern).  Yesterday I was scheduled to talk to a student who had some questions about the campaign. He's Republican and was planning on interning with our current Attorney General's campaign. But he heard about me he liked what I was saying and he wanted to know where I stood on a variety of issues.  We talked for 47 minutes. I asked maybe two questions that entire time. This was his interview of me.  We didn't agree on everything. He does not support abortion. We talked a lot about privacy rights the underpinnings of personal freedom the tragic history of government intervention in medical decisions. He wanted to know my stance on guns. I talked about the training I've gone through how Missouri used to require training to carry concealed but doesn't anymore how there's a big difference between growing up respecting guns and buying a handgun when you're a teenager without any training because you fear for your life and how we can get together from across the political spectrum to take on violent crime. We talked about the economy why I want to start Missouri's first Civil Rights Division how the office works. We talked about why I like working with folks I don't always agree with.  But most importantly we talked about his community service how he'll be spending his summer helping folks in need of food how involved he is at his church.  At the end of the conversation I asked him how I did and whether he wanted to work with me.  He said ""Do you have debates with the Attorney General?"" ""I hope so."" ""I can be your practice partner.""  This is how we take back Missouri.",political,Facebook
Conundrums Enigmas Cul de Sacs and Riddles - Charlie's Soapbox 11/1/19  He shall be a wild donkey of a man his hand against everyone and everyone's hand against him and he shall dwell over against all his kinsmen.  This is from the book of Genesis 16:12 and deals with Ishmael son of Hagar the servant of Sarah. The birthright however belonged to Ishmael's younger brother Isaac for it was through him that God's promises were made to Abraham the boys' father.  Later Isaac would also have two boys Esau and Jacob.  The story of Esau trading his birthright for a bowl of lentil soup is well known and how Jacob and his mother Rebekah deceived their father Isaac who was near-blind in his old age into giving him the blessing that belonged to the oldest son which would have been Esau since he had been born a little before Jacob.  God would later change Jacobs name to Israel and he would go on to become the father of the patriarchs of the Twelve Tribes of Israel the Hebrew people.  Esau would go on to be the father of the Edomites the Turks the Kurds Syrians tribes of nomadic people in fact a large part of the Muslim and Arabic world descended from Ishmael Esau and their offspring and although the Bible says that there was a reconciliation between Jacob and Esau their decedents have basically been at war or at least hostile toward each other for thousands of years.  The more I learn about the Middle East and Southwest Asia the more I realize how profoundly Western countries misunderstand the depth of the blood feuds the vendettas the centuries-old customs the tribal loyalties and family ties that are so prevalent and so deeply rooted in this part of the world.  Their code of ethics their sense of what is honorable their ingrained adherence to male dominance and hatred of ancient enemies that have survived for millennia are things the Western mind cannot grasp.  The old adage me and my cousins against the world me and my brothers against my cousins certainly bears out the wild donkey of a man prophecy in the Old Testament.  There is bad blood between the Sunnis and Shiites the Alawites the different tribes and warlords in many places in the Muslim world and it always seems to come down to whoever has control of the most guns.  Trying to bring peace to the Muslim world is much like sticking your fist in a tub of water the water is only displaced until you pull your hand out then the hole closes up.  There is always another strong man another ISIS or Taliban or al-Qaeda or Boko Haram or power-mad leader of a whole nation waiting in the wings to break the treaty or the cease-fire as soon as the restraining troops are pulled out.  In my humble opinion America should never go to war without a clear goal and a valid definition of what constitutes victory and that definition should be based on the interests of America and our allies.  We could keep troops in that part of the world ad infinitum lose thousands of lives spend trillions of dollars and as soon as we pull out the blood-shed between the factions would begin again.  Thanks to the loosening of restrictions on petroleum production we no longer need their oil and if Europe and Asia are dependent on it let them put some skin in the game commit their own troops and look after their own interests. Americas days of being policeman for the world should be over.  We should adopt a strict hands-off Israel or pay a price you cant afford doctrine do a new assessment as to who is and who is not our friends make our alliances and with the exception of some special forces units to keep an eye on things bring our troops home.  I even hate to say this but I fear that not too far down the line America will have bigger fish to fry as China Russia and North Korea seem to be gearing up for something and you can bet it will not be something that will benefit America.  How long will we put American men and women into harms way to separate factions and stand between religious sects who as soon as the troops go home will pick up right where they left off before we wasted American blood and treasure trying to change millennia-old enemies.  I believe with all my heart that peace will only come when to that part of the world Jesus Christ returns.  Until then there will be wars and rumors of wars.  What do you think?  Pray for our troops our police and the peace of Jerusalem.  God Bless America  Charlie Daniels,political,Facebook

#LettersInSupportOfVillanueva  To the Los Angeles Times editor: Villanueva has committed the sin of rebuking a Democrat. How dare he accuse Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti of an inept response to the homelessness crisis? (Except that its true.)  Villanueva ran for office in 2018 at a time of heightened anti-Trump sentiment. Then-Sheriff Jim McDonnell was perceived as collaborating with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement or ICE when the Trump administration was conducting surprise raids in L.A. County.  Villanueva vowed to throw ICE out of county jails if elected. He won the election and has indeed banned inmate transfers to ICE custody.  Villanueva is direct confrontational and all over the map politically. He has publicly celebrated Pride Month but at the other end of the political spectrum he has promised to allow more permits for carrying concealed guns.  He seems to be a maverick rather than an ideological loyalist. If that bothers progressives who expect loyalty to their agenda they had better find someone else.

"Here is another letter that you can use to send to your legislators and have for discussions. Please like our FB Page Follow us on Twitter visit our Website and SHARE everywhere. Thank you for voting Republican !!!  Dear Representative  Please do NOT pass any additional firearm ban laws. Simply enforce ALL the laws that are already in effect and solve REAL problems in our state.  We do NOT have a firearm problem. We have a broken family problem. 75% of black families are broken and fatherless. 83% of the prison population in Virginia is minority. The majority of gun crime is black on black in only a few cities. Yet only 13% of Americans are black.  We have a mental health crisis in America. 60% of firearm deaths are suicide. There are 70000 opioid deaths per year; 3-times the rate of firearm suicides.  Yet in Virginia there is legislation to ban AK-47s & AR-15s which are semi-automatic rifles and fire at the same rate as semi-automatic handguns. You might be surprised to hear that there were only 30 rifle homicides in Virginia last year; this includes the AR & AK assault rifle.  There is NO such thing as an assault rifle. There is NO difference between an assault rifle and any other firearm except they look scarier. All firearms once fired at someone constitute the crime of assault.  Another interesting fact based on population rate Illegal aliens commit half the firearm homicides. The US population is about 320 million with illegal aliens making up 10% of the population (30 million) and committing 10% of all firearm homicides. Therefore illegal aliens commit half the firearm homicides on a population rate basis.  Now that we put things into proper context with the previous facts. Please do not legislate any further gun laws. Please also take into consideration the following additional facts that also do NOT support more gun control laws.  All the facts demonstrate the need to lessen gun restrictions for law abiding individuals and eliminate gun free zones so innocent people can protect themselves and others. Good people with guns are NOT the problem. Good people with guns are needed for protection from bad people with guns based on our US Constitution.  Our US & Virginia Constitutions State Code & Supreme Court say ""..right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed."" ; military should be governed by civil power.  militia shall consist of all able-bodied residents of Virginia who are citizens of the United States. Thats us.  There are 8.5 million Virginians. 2.8 million people of ALL political parties own firearms. Majority of homes have firearms. Of the 60000 Deaths In Virginia last year ONLY 340 were firearm homicides ZERO in my James City County. The Virginia firearm homicide rate is ONLY .004%. You have a better chance of getting struck by lightning than murdered with a gun. Virginia has the 4th lowest violent crime rate in the nation because un-infringed gun ownership is a deterrent. Virginia doesnt have a firearm problem. Dangerous cities have a firearm-ban problem. Radical special interest groups falsely blame gun violence on law abiding Citizens in order to disguise their agenda of power money & control. In the US Annually gun owners prevent 2.5 million crimes. 90% of gun crime takes place in gun free zones. Criminals dont follow laws. If gun rights are taken away Virginians cant defend themselves.  State Representatives you have a duty & took an oath to uphold our Constitution. Since law enforcement does NOT have a duty to protect Virginians and government CANNOT guarantee our protection please do not do anything to infringe on Virginians rights to protect themselves with any semi-automatic weapon they choose to be best for them.  Over 95% of Virginia jurisdictions have already committed to protecting the 2nd Amendment with 2nd Amendment Sanctuary and Constitution Resolutions. These 2nd Amendment Resolutions are endorsed by many Sheriffs and their willingness to deputize citizens in order to fulfill their oaths to the same Constitution guaranteeing that the right to bear arms SHALL NOT be infringed; so citizens can protect themselves and assist law enforcement by deterring or preventing crime. This action sends a resounding message to lawmakers to preserve our Constitutional Rights and keep Virginia safe & secure.  If you choose not to follow the law and the will of the people you will be wasting ALL of your legislative time and your Virginia budget will be tied up in court battles for the next two years until you are NOT re-elected.  If you would like to debate these facts I am available any time for a non-emotional sensible factual discussion.  Best Regards from your constituent",political,Facebook
SOME THINGS TO KNOW AFTER THE MASSACRES IN EL PASO AND DAYTON 1. The killers in both cities used what are sometimes called assault weapons. 2. The most important feature of these is that they are semi-automatic meaning that they can be fired simply by pulling the trigger. Each pull of the trigger fires one shot. 3. That distinguishes them from automatic weapons (machine guns) which continue to fire as long as the trigger is held down. Automatic weapons are illegal. Assault weapons are identical to military weapons except that military weapons can be used in automatic mode although they rarely are. 4. To get an idea of how fast a semi-automatic rifle can fire consider that the Dayton shooter shot 23 people nine fatally in about 30 seconds. He fired a total of 41 shots. 5. The Dayton gunman also used a magazine holding 100 bullets. 6. Other than convenience its hard to imagine a legitimate civilian purpose for either an assault weapon or a 100-round magazine. But theyre extremely useful for use in mass shootings. 7. Federal courts have repeatedly ruled that bans on assault weapons and oversized magazines are constitutional. No such ruling has been successfully appealed. Enough slaughter. While Congress is recess go to town halls held by your elected representatives. Tell them you want a ban on assault weapons and oversized magazines. If your representative is a Republican senator also tell him to ask Mitch McConnell to schedule a vote on the bill for universal background checks. If you cant go phone.

"*WARNING!! WEST VIRGINIA'S CITIZENS COULD LOSE VALUABLE PROPERTY RIGHTS!*  Do you like your church? You probably do but if your local School Superintendent does not like your religious beliefs then they can take your church for a school owned resort. Sound crazy? Well that line of reasoning is currently being advanced in Jefferson County WV Circuit Court by the Jefferson County Board of Education and far left attorney Del. Isaac Sponaugle.  As the liberal local newspaper (the Spirit of Jefferson) says: this is an ""unbelievable"" and ""ridiculous"" abuse of power.  The BOE's action is being backed by a George Soros funded radical group. This group has already been the subject of 40+ arrests after disrupting government operations and physically intimidating young government employees.  Here is the story: At nearly midnight on Monday last week the Jefferson County BOE without any public notice voted to steal the property of a private company because the radical School Superintendent and President of the Board of Education dislike the company. What did the company do? It wants to use WV natural gas and coal.  Well at least the company will get full value for its property right? Not in Jefferson County the BOE is trying to take the property for less than 3% of its value. Yes $1.3 million for property worth over $50 million.  If the BOE and these radicals get their way then every Board of Education and government unit in West Virginia will be able to take your property for any reason. If these entities disagree with your religious teaching they can come in and shut you down by condemning your property. If you speak against them then they can take your property. If they don't like guns they can take your farm where you hunt.  What can you do to help stop this? The following:  First email the President of the Jefferson County BOE Kathy Skinner at skinnerboe@gmail.com. Tell her to stop her radical actions.  Second email Del. Isaac Sponaugle at isaac.sponaugle@wvhouse.gov and ask him to enact legislation to stop the abuse of power that he is helping to implement.",political,Facebook
"Racial Profiling in Tampa Bay  When you hear all the splendid accolades elected officials like Ken Welch Charlie Christ and others are giving to SPPD Chief Holloway and Pinellas County Sheriff Gualtieri you would think an issue like racial profiling was not a driving factor in their effort to police. You would be wrong. At this point I am not even mad with the police departments anymore I am mad at the elected officials specially those with 10 plus years in multiple public offices. How can you be seating here telling that you care when you have done nothing absolutely nothing to change things. You just kept your head down and when you finally look up you look the other way. This is not Intentional Leadership! This is cowardice. Here educate yourself:  ""Tampa Bay law enforcement arent collecting comprehensive traffic stop data. Experts say that information is crucial for accountability. By Kavitha Surana As a reporter I hear stories from people concerned about racial profiling and traffic stops in their community. Laurie Jones a leader at HOPE a Hillsborough County-based coalition of religious and community organizations worries for her son a young Black man. Im nervous when my son drives around my quiet community she said. He can be stopped five or six times a year with no citation or warning. She said the frequent stops affect residents of all ages and erode trust between police and the Black community. Research supports her concerns. A 2020 study drawing on nearly 100 million traffic stops across the United States found that Black drivers were still about 20 percent more likely to be stopped than white drivers relative to their share of the population. Once stopped Black drivers were searched nearly twice as often as white drivers the study found but officers were less likely to find contraband like drugs and guns. I wanted to get my hands on Tampa Bay traffic stop data to see if I could pinpoint these dynamics locally. So I reached out to six major law enforcement agencies. I knew some states and cities had moved toward collecting comprehensive traffic stop data  meaning information on every stop not just citations. Florida does not require law enforcement to do so. What I found is that few Tampa Bay agencies proactively monitor traffic stop data. St. Petersburg and Clearwater police have made some efforts but they miss wide gaps of data making it difficult to analyze according to experts. Most agencies pointed to body cameras and said they could thoroughly investigate any allegations of bias. But disparities also can come through in the enforcement strategy an agency chooses experts told me. Jones said HOPE has been pressing Hillsborough agencies to collect comprehensive data for all traffic stops. But at a recent meeting to share best practices officials did not appear receptive. We left angry and frustrated she told me that in this day and time with everything going on in this country they still dont want to track the data to show that everything is above board and officers are not stopping people inappropriately. For a closer look at how traffic stop data that keeps police accountable is lacking on the local front and examples of how some other states handle it read my story. """,political,Facebook

Learning a trade changed my life Career Technical Education can do the same for thousands more.  By Dane White  When I graduated from High School in 2007 in Panguitch Utah I was not able to afford college and my lifestyle choices had precluded me from pursuing a higher education at that time. I had previously experienced a rough upbringing and at 15 was sent to a boarding school. After spending 19 months there I ran away. I then spent the rest of my childhood lost homeless at times constantly in trouble with the law and eventually finding myself in juvenile hall awaiting placement in a foster home.  It was not a great period of my life but there was a silver lining: I was fortunate enough to pick up some basic skills. I could usually find some money by offering to help out my friends dad who happened to be a contractor. Typically that consisted of picking up trash at job sites holding the dumb end of a tape measure or silently watching the process of building a deck framing walls or finishing carpentry. Over time I picked up more skills like how to read a tape measure how to make basic cuts on a miter saw or table saw and how to shoot nail guns.  Shortly after my 18th birthday I was released from foster care. It was time to be an adult the best I knew how. I relied on those basic skills to find a job with a general contractor back in my hometown of Escondido. Since then I have refined those skills enough to become a successful laborer project manager foreman and even work on my own as a handyman. I enjoy being a craftsman and have learned to appreciate compliments like You have excellent attention to detail or Its evident you strive for perfection. This has brought a tremendous amount of self-worth and satisfaction into my life.  I find myself thinking back to those humble beginnings a lot now as I currently serve as the President of the Escondido Union High School Board of Trustees. From the beginning of my campaign up until now serving as President I have been motivated by how vital Career Technical Education and vocational training are to the community of Escondido. If students have an opportunity to learn even basic skills early on they have an opportunity to avoid some of those mistakes that I made and can have a head start at achieving a successful career and life. Escondido has phenomenal Career Technical Education (CTE) programs ranging from a renowned Culinary Arts program at Orange Glen wildly successful Agriculture programs at San Pasqual and Escondido High in addition to classes in Auto Welding and Wood Working.  These are real skills that translate to real jobs and have a real impact on students lives.  Which is why I was so disappointed a couple months ago when I discovered administrators in my district were planning on adjusting curriculum requirements to squeeze CTE programs off our freshman and sophomore agendas in favor of additional core-curriculum classes to expedite students on their pathways to graduation and college readiness.  This was not a nefarious attempt to cut our districts CTE programs. It was a genuine effort to keep our students on track. Yet it would have the effect of greatly reducing the number of Escondido students enrolled in CTE programs. Which meant that in my eyes the plan was entirely unacceptable.  Thankfully we had many of our districts passionate and dedicated CTE teachers and core-curriculum teachers voice their concerns to the Board of Education.  My message to those teachers: we heard you. I heard you.  We are committed to ensuring that each student is presented with CTE as an option in selecting their classes at each of our districts high schools.  However challenges lie ahead. The states proposed budget includes potential deep cuts to K-12 education and CTE programs seem to always be on the chopping block. Sacramento is currently engaging in the budget process and I remain hopeful that CTE funding remains intact for the coming school year.  These funding challenges in addition to declining enrollment in our district are forcing us to make tough decisions and get creative to balance budgets and maintain current levels of programming. And it is only going to get more difficult with time. But I also know that students who graduate with career-ready skills like I did are well positioned to find a good paying job and make a living for themselves and their families. I also know that CTE classes are often times the most fun part of our students days. These programs allow students to put down the pens and pencils close the textbooks and explore all the wonderful things they are able to do with their curiosity and creativity.  In Escondido Career Technical Education is not a program that can be cut when the budgets get tight schedules fill up or tough decisions need to be made. CTE is at the heart of our mission as a school district. I look forward to continuing to work alongside our CTE teachers and our districts leadership to make sure every one of our students has the opportunity to learn career-ready life changing skills at our Escondido high schools.  ###  Dane White was elected to the Escondido Union High School District Board of Trustees in 2016 and currently serves as Board President.

"We dont do things in city government on emotion we do things on fact.""  ""Under my administration we do it on facts. We will research and make a fact based decision based on the law based on state statute and the constitution. Thats how we are going to operate. Excuse the pun but we arent going to just shoot from the hip and just do something because someone wants something done that isnt fact based and is based on only emotions.  -Mayor John Cannon April 2 2019  The above quote is in reference to a recent concern of home-based FFLs (Federal Firearm License) brought to the Portage City Council's attention during public discussion at the March 2019 meeting.

Shall Not Be Infringed!  A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed  2nd Amendment to the US Constitution.  Those opposed to law-abiding American citizens possessing modern firearms frequently fall back on the argument that the Founders never envisioned the weapons that would be available in our day and really only were concerned that citizens could posses muskets with which to feed their families.  This line of argumentation is so far from the truth that it is almost ludicrous to consider it as any quick reading of our Founders would make evident. In fact Ive yet to hear any liberal opposed to the 2nd Amendment use the same argument regarding the 1st Amendment.  The Internet is a recent development and the Founders could hardly have known that some future invention of technology would deliver the power of the written word directly into the hands of the people. My writing and the reading of this are the prime example. There are those who would be glad to shut me up but for the 1st Amendment.  Dont get me wrong Im not suggesting that there are not those who would be glad to use any means they could whether the Constitution or some other device to silence those with whom they disagree but no one has been stupid enough at least yet to seriously suggest such a scheme.  Moving back to the fallacious argument of muskets and the 2nd Amendment the argument that the Founders only wanted us to have muskets rather than the modern day battlefield military-style firearms available to us is ridiculous on its face.  Lets understand this ever since the invention of the powder gun improvements had been ongoing to deliver to the people a useable and easy to use weapon as a short history of firearms development in America will show. In fact the musket our liberal friends want us to have rather than the modern battlefield weapons of today was ironically a battlefield weapon and the latest and greatest firearm that was available in 1791 when the 2nd Amendment was ratified. If the Founders were concerned that citizens should not possess the same weapon that the armies of their day possessed they could have and would have written the amendment differently. Lets put to bed the idea that the Founders would never have agreed to the 2nd Amendment if they knew that the people would have user friendly weapons with which to protect themselves and their families against any comers. And lets add particular mention that the Founders were highly concerned with the tyranny that so often arises in government when it begins to gain unlimited authority with the firepower to back it up.  The second fallacious argument about firearms is that there is no reason for a citizen to be armed with the same weapons that are used by our military. This is a particular jab at one of the most popular and for good reason firearms of our day the AR-15.  I have an AR-15 and I enjoy taking it to the range and mastering the sport of precise target shooting. Additionally if circumstances should ever arise that called for its use in another situation at home I am contented to have it nearby in my locked gun cabinet.  I will say this though if the US government ever called on me in some type of emergency to go and fight out on the open battlefield or go door-to-door as our troops often do to rooting out insurgents and told me to bring my AR-15 (with its 10-round magazines thanks to Governor Murphy) I would roundly decline. None of our troops are using anything remotely like the AR-15 that I have in my gun cabinet and they would be foolish to do so.  Its important to understand the differences between America and other western democracy-based countries such as Britain Australia Germany New Zealand etc. Those countries do not have a Constitution like ours and Founders that understood the necessity of natural or God-given (readers choice) rights. It is not a privilege for me to own a firearm it is a right.  Now Im going to make what some might consider a controversial statement. If there are those who dislike the liberty provided in the Constitution the Bill of Rights and the 2nd Amendment in particular maybe they should go to England or Australia or New Zealand because they are not allowed to possess firearms. So anyone opposed to the ownership of firearms would feel much more comfortable in one of those societies. If going to London however be concerned about the knife problem there. Remember this our founding documents establish rule from the bottom up. We the people are in charge and our elected representatives swear allegiance to the Constitution and pledge to represent us. Those other countries I named are ruled for all intents and purposes from the top down. The people are told what they may and may not have and that is the end of it.  The final argument against the 2nd Amendment is made from gun deaths especially involving children in the US. Again this is a specious argument not based on facts but based on emotion. Do we ever hear how many children die from medical mistreatment in automobile accidents in swimming pool and bathtub drownings being killed by an illegal immigrant and on and on and on? No because the numbers dwarf so-called mass shootings. But then we hear well if it would save one childs life why wouldnt we get rid of guns? How many children are killed by illegal immigrants illegals that have been deported multiple times and still come back to kill? Why not shut down the borders and build the wall if it would save the life of one child? Yes this argument is nothing but emotion and totally disingenuous. Its not about safety as much as about control.  Our presidential aspirants especially those who claim that if Congress does not act they will and begin gun confiscation should be very very careful. This is not Australia and no one has any plans to turn over their prized possessions to the government  the same government that said Everyone will have health care or else. One candidate even went so far as to get in a Twitter back and forth over his plan to confiscate guns and suggested to an American who was pushing back that the government had the military to enforce its laws and then foolishly added that the military has nukes. Hes gone now but he was the butt of endless amounts of jokes on FaceBook and Twitter.  The military is not here to enforce the unconstitutional laws of feckless pandering politicians the military is pledged to protect America. Guns in the hands of citizens are the means by which we hold our government at bay when the tendency is there for tyranny. Given what I am hearing from some of the Democrat candidates for president it seems like tyranny is just around the corner. Its important for these gun-grabbers to understand: the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.,political,Facebook
"The Bill of Rights including the 2nd Amendment was introduced to reside in Article 1 Section 9 of the Constitution when James Madison first introduced them to the 1st Continental Congress.  Article 1 Section 9 is ""Limits on Congress"". However the process of adding to the Constitution by amending it prevented the limits from being placed in Article 1 Section 9 and instead required them to be added as separate amendments. This gives us the illusion that these are not limits on Congress when in reality they are.  Nearly every amendment in the Bill of Rights was slated to reside in Article 1 Section 9 to limit and direct the enumerated power of Congress to its proper objects.  This is precisely why John Jay called on the wisest of people to serve in government. Today nearly no one in government can begin to think of policy that can combat mass shootings while at the same time strengthen liberty. This eludes to a conclusion that those advocating for gun control are simply not up to the task required of them according to the Constitution and provides us with an example as to why wise leadership is imperative in government.  The 2nd Amendment is important because Article 1 Section 8 Clause 15 and 16 speaks to the power of government to organize arm and oversee the Militia.  This created a conflict of interest between the People who have a Right to keep and bear arms and the government which has an obligation to the People with regards to the Militia.  The 2nd Amendment needed to mention the Militia in order to not supersede or strip away this enumerated Power from government by confirming that the Militia was still necessary in lieu of the 2nd Amendment.  The 2nd Amendment essentially ensured and legitimized the need of government to oversee the needs and requirements of the Militia while at the same time declared the People have the Right to keep and bear arms. It made them two separate and distinct interests.  At the same time since these interests were distinctly separate it prevented government from using privately owned guns of those in the Militia to satisfy its mandate to arm the Militia.  In the Federalist Papers Hamilton speaks to Clause 15 and 16 of Article 1 Section 8 and states that the Militia it addresses is with regards to individuals that are in direct service to government and not the People at large.  Finally you'll notice in the 2nd Amendment that it does not refer to big ""M"" and little ""m"" to separate between the organized and unorganized militia. It makes an even broader distinction between the militia and the people at large to make sure that there was a complete and total disconnect between the obligation of government and the Rights of the People which originate from our unalienable Rights with its roots in self-preservation of life.  Imagine for just one moment if government created policy that focused on preserving Rights and Liberties instead of regulating types of guns.",political,Facebook
A race free analysis of the Ahmaud Arbery killing  When I first saw this story on my feed I didnt spend any time looking into it. I didnt watch the video but I did read the headline and was aware of the race of the players which isnt important to me. My understanding was that a couple of guys wanted to make a citizens arrest on a man they saw running through their neighborhood because of recent property thefts and ended up shooting him. I posted a comment on that article that the two men essentially shot Arbery over personal property because they thought he may be a thief and that they should be prosecuted because nobody should be killed in order to defend personal property.  Then I saw a comment about the incident on a subsequent post that stated that Arbery made an attempt to wrestle the gun from the younger McMichael. This raised a red flag for me so I dug into it a little more. I have since viewed the longest video I could find and read some more reporting which also mildly explained the law governing citizens arrests. Until more facts come out this is my analysis currently.  There were two pivotal mistakes made one by the McMichaels and the other by Arbery. The first pivotal mistake was made by the McMichaels for trying to make an illegal citizens arrest because they had no probable cause to arrest Arbery. Apparently they saw him doing nothing but running through their neighborhood. It wasnt like they just saw him murder someone or commit some other type of violent crime. However the video evidence does show that they didnt chase him down just to kill him because he was black. They could have done that without getting out of the truck. They were indeed trying to effect a citizens arrest as misguided and illegal as it was and there is no evidence that the encounter was motivated by racism.  I dont think they were wrong in taking a gun because they had no way of knowing if Arbery was armed and capable of being violent. However they should not have approached Arbery in such a reckless manner with their guns brandished. Brandishing guns the way they did only added great a deal of tension to the situation. They should have left their guns stowed but accessible if needed for self-defense purposes. They should have only tried talking to or monitoring him without trying to detain him. That is the job of the police.  The second and most consequential mistake was made by Arbery when he attacked the younger McMichael and made an attempt to take the gun away from him. This is undeniable the video shows this. In the video you can see Arbery running down the middle of the road with the McMichaels truck stopped in front of him with the younger McMichael standing outside the truck trying to stop Arbery. Arbery then diverts around the truck and then swerves toward McMichael and initiates a physical confrontation with McMichael and begins to try to wrestle the gun from him.  All of the reporting I saw stated that Arbery was unarmed. This is true up to a point but the moment Arbery grabbed the gun he became just as armed as McMichael. The moment Abery charged at and tried to wrestle the gun from McMichael is the moment the entire dynamic changed. It does not matter that what the McMichaels were doing was illegal or unwarranted. This encounter was reduced to two men one holding a gun and the other trying to take it from him.  I think the McMichaels should be charged with something what I do not know. They were wrong when they chased after Arbery in such a reckless manner but Arbery was wrong when he attacked the younger McMichael and tried to take control of the gun. Again it does not matter that what the McMichaels were doing was illegal it was happening. Arbery could have swerved away from McMichael or stopped and allowed the arrest or detention to occur. He could then file charges against the McMichaels for false arrest or illegal detention and then maybe they would be sitting in jail while he was out running in the streets again.  The moment he created the scuffle for the gun he changed the dynamic and put himself in deep jeopardy and even made it possible for the Younger McMichael to claim self-defense. Arbery should have conducted himself the way most businesses want their employees to act when confronted with an illegal actor such as an armed robbergive him what he wants and dont try to be a hero.comply and survive.,political,Facebook

NIMROD and the 2020 ELECTION You are askingwhat does Nimrod have to do with our upcoming election? Lets take a look at Nimrodhe was the first of the mighty men to appear on earth after the Flood (Genesis 10:8-12). He established a great kingdom which included the city of Babeland oh yesthe Tower of Babel (Genesis 11:1-9). The Tower occurred in the time frame of 2242 B.C. Nimrod was the designer of an ancient power structure and the founder of a false religion. He wanted to become God so he attempted to build a tower to Heaven hoping to thwart the plans of God. Gods mighty power ended the tower construction and the people were settled in other parts of the world.  Nimrod birthed a new religion called globalism that is very active today and still spreading. Here is a partial list of Nimrods spiritual heirs: Illuminati including the Rothschilds and Rockefellers; Clinton organization; Soros; Saul Alinsky; United Nations; Pope Francis and the Global Public Authority; IMF; The World Bank; International Criminal Court; Obama shadow government; Club of Rome; Druids; Free Masons; Bohemian Grove; Yale University Skull and Bones; Satanic Club; Order of Assassins; Bilderberg Group; and the Council of Foreign Relations.  Lets talk about America. God is in control of all that happens in this world. Psalm 75:7 states It is God who judges nations. He brings one down and exalts another. God has allowed America to become a great nation founded on Judeo-Christian principles. But He has a warningHe will bless each nation with a span of time so it might prosper and do well but this blessing ends when a nation becomes degenerate rebellious and unfit to rule.  Our nation was founded in 1776we are 244 years old now! We have an experiment called a representative democracy or a constitutional republic and I believe we are close to losing that experiment.  What has happened to our country in the past sixty some years? America has become completely demoralized desensitized and deceived. For our democracy and republic to work requires the legislative leaders and citizens to be spiritually mature. Your guessdo we have that situation now? And what about the morals of our country? Morals can only be built on the basis of a true moral sourceand that is God. Not following Gods morals will lead to anarchyare we seeing that today? It appears that we have rejected objective moral values in favor of political correctness. Serious questionare we self destructing from within?  I believe we are a post Christian nation. Why? A list of Supreme Court rulings provides the answer. America has crossed over every Biblical boundary!  1962: Removal of prayer in public schools.  1963: Removal of Bible reading in public schools.  1973: Legalized abortions.  1980: Ten Commandments not allowed in public schools.  2003: Struck down sodomy law.  2013: Struck down Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA).  2015: Ruled in favor of same sex marriages.  In addition to the above what are some of the hot issues going on in our country now.  Covid-19 pandemic: A real issue but blown out of proportion and politicized. Churches are non-essential while abortion clinics are essential.  The wall illegals ICE and sanctuary cities.  A national debt of $22 trillion with $100 trillion of unfunded liabilities.  Black Lives Matter White Lives Matter Blue Lives Matter (police). Dont forget all lives matter in Gods sight.  LGBTQ issues.  Abortion euthanasia and the selling of aborted baby parts.  Global warming hoax starring Al Gore.  Epstein/Maxwell and human trafficking.  Defund/dismantle police forces.  The Squad Islam BDS of Israel.  You add to this list please.  Now let me show you how close we are to a full blown socialist state which will lead to a communist state. I mentioned Saul Alinsky abovehe wrote a book called Rules for Radicals. Hillary Clinton did her college thesis on his writings and Obama writes about him in his books. Alinsky expounds there are eight levels of control before you can create a socialist state. Check these out and tell me how we are doing.  1. Healthcare: Control healthcare and you control the people. My responsewe are almost there with a one-payer system called socialized medicine. 2. Poverty: Increase the poverty level as high as possible. Poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live. My responsewe are there now. 3. Debt: Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. My responsewe are there now. 4. Gun control: Take guns away and remove ability to defend oneself. That way you are able to create a police state. My responseenough Americans are armed now and this will not happen in the immediate future. 5. Welfare: Take control of every aspect of their lives. My responsethis is happening as we speak. 6. Education: Take control of what people read and listen to. Take control of what children learn in schools. The saying goesget the children and you have the future. My responsewe are there now. 7. Religion: Remove the belief in God from the government and schools. My responsewe are there now. 8. Class warfare: Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent and it will be easier to tax the wealthy to support the poor. My responsewe are there now.  Not a pretty picture is it!  We are on a fast track to a New World Order which includes a one world government currency and religion. The world has turned to secular humanism and that is the successor to Christianity. It began with the Humanist Manifesto in 1933 then revised in 1973. The theory of evolution replaced Gods six days of creation. Science is now worshiped as mans only hope and science denies Gods creation.  What about our churches? The Bible tells us that in the end times churches will sink into apostasy and worldliness. It is happening! Church influence is weakening or gone. Jesus is not being preached from the pulpit. Name one church today in which the pastor calls abortion a sin from the pulpit. Another pointno true born again believer can support murdering babies. If you believe in the one true God and His Bible then you have to be concerned.  All of the above to get to the 2020 election! Our country is in a big mess. The upcoming November election is the most important one in history when it comes to the future of our country. We are in a struggle for our national soul.  A quick review of the 2016 election. Trump announced his candidacy in June 2015 and then won the election with a 304-227 electoral college victory over Hillary Clinton. Against all oddsTrump showed up! My opinionTrump is not perfect by any means. He was born a sinner just like you and me. But it is obvious that God is using him in many ways as our President. I only wish that Trump be more careful and selective in his language that goes out over the internet the airwaves and print.  What has happened since? The veil of immorality greed corruption and deceit has been torn open. No President has ever faced what Trump has in his first four year term.  Here are just a few:  The Swamp including both Democrats and Republicans.  The never Trumpers (Romney Flake Ryan Bush family and others).  The Dems and mass media being one.  Deep State found in all agencies.  FBI corruption (Comey McCabe Mueller).  The Clintons and their foundation.  Attorney General & Justice Department (Lynch Holder Rosenstein.)  CIA & National Intelligence (Clapper & Brennan).  Obamas Organizing for Action (OFA) shadow government (2 miles from White House). The Organization is a democratic activist group to fight Trumps every move.  Mueller investigation.  FISA abuses.  Illegal immigration issuesthe wall.  Tax returns.  Covid-19 pandemic.  Russian probe.  Impeachment (Schumer Pelosi Nadler Schiff).  Nationalism versus globalism.  Soros threatened to take down Trump to fulfill NWO plans for financial Armageddon.  We know that if Hillary had won all the lies cover-ups and wrong doings done by Obama and Hillary would have been buried. Now they are being uncovered gradually. We are waiting on the Durham report.  The hatred of Trump can only be understood as demonically driven and thus galvanizing the division of our nation. We see that most of the Washington bureaucrats are people of depraved hearts and minds no longer knowing right from wrong.  We need Trump four more years to continue his work in saving maintaining and improving our republic and democracy.  What if Trump loses and the Democrats take the White House the Senate and keep the House. God forbid! If that happens the spiritual heirs of Nimrod win big. I predict we will have a full blown socialist government within eight years.  I do believe that God in His mercy is giving us just a little time as a country to repent. I believe that God has given us plenty of warnings and is beginning His judgment on our country. My opinion is that America will not recoverwe are too far gonewe are beyond the point of returnthere will be no national repentance.  I pray that I am wrong.

A new terribly sad letter but one that must be written ..  Dear Hater-in-Chief  It doesnt absolve you of your responsibility for a mass shooting when you Tweet God bless them all! and express your condolences. It doesnt absolve you of responsibility when you state  too late by far  that we should all come together and not hate. As more than one had tweeted to you you have divided America more than any person in history. I quote here @keanothedog.  Obviously you didnt pull the trigger of the AK-17 that killed at least 21 people in El Paso. But the syllogism of causation is compelling:  Trump expresses hatred toward immigrants calling Mexicans rapists  Trump repeatedly contends that the United States is being invaded and that this so-called invasion is a national emergency on our Southern border  Trump praises American Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan calling them some very fine people --- Lets call that A.  Trump supporters most of whom are armed hear Trump rhetoric (A) and feel both emboldened to express their own hatred and feel threatened as well  Indeed many of these Trump supporters because of Trump rhetoric feel that their privileged way of life is in danger  Lets call that B.  Those who feel threatened because of Trump rhetoric and who can get their hands on guns  assault weapons easily available massive magazines easily available [were a country of 330000000 people but more guns are owned by people than there are people] will try to kill those whom they perceived as the enemy. Thats C.  A + B = C  Without A theres no B and no C.  Or to use numbers with no vile rhetoric from Trump 21 human beings in El Paso would still be alive today.  Very truly yours  Bruce J.

Riddle me this one Batman.  Trump says that the mentally ill kill not the guns. He says that we need to have legislation that takes away guns from the mentally ill. For the sake of this conversation let's say I TOTALLY AGREE WITH THIS (even though statistically only 25% of shooters have mental health issues.) But I digress. Explain this:  FACT: On February 28 2017 shortly after taking office President Trump signed a bill into law rolling back an Obama-era regulation that made it harder for people with mental illnesses to purchase a gun. The rule which was finalized in December 2016 added people receiving Social Security checks for mental illnesses and people deemed unfit to handle their own financial affairs to the national background check database. Had the rule fully taken effect the Obama administration predicted it would have added about 75000 names to that database.

When the Iraq war started I had to volunteer. At the time I had been living in the United States 26 years. I had to volunteer to help America Liberate my home country Iraq. After all I am a sanitary sewer engineer and speak the native language fluently. Both assets are very much needed. When I went back after 26 years of living in the States I was focused to what I wanted to contribute to my COUNTRY AMERICA. I had no idea that this trip is going to be humbling and I will emerge an enlightened new person. Prior to going back to Iraq all I ever knew of what our military did was carrying guns and fight in wars with other countries. I had no idea that they actually build nations. I saw them in action. I am a witness to their generosities goodness caring and wonderfulness. I want to share all my experiences with you but separate them one by one so they each gets the deserved praise and glory. Ill write names but not the full names because I have not asked their permissions. I know if I do they will try to talk me out of it simply because that who they are. They want to do their jobs and dont care about any praise. My job was in the old Saddam presidential palace. I stayed in the green zone which meant I roomed with military or State Department ladies in modular homes and walked to the office. The office I worked in included about 150 Iraqi Expats but only 3 or 4 worked at the office. The rest were placed at different ministries according to their specialties. Every one of the people who worked for our group which was called the Iraqi Reconstruction and Development Council (IRDC) came to the office once a month to collect their pay. I had already made many friends with the US military because most of them were in close proximity to our office and most of us went to the dining hall for meals. One LT. Col. Merrill became friend with us and the people working in our office. When my cousin who was still living in Iraq asked me to help purchase a $250 wheelchair for her neighbor who desperately needed it I put a collection envelop on my desk and was planning to ask the rest of the IRDC members to donate on the next payday. LT. Col. Merrill asked me what that envelop with the word Wheelchair meant I explained to him the reason and my plan to get the money donated from the rest of the 150 members on payday. We all walked to lunch after that and each went their separate way to our jobs. In less than 2 hours LT. Col. Merrill came back to our office and handed me $250 dollars that he had collected from his U.S. military friends and colleagues and told me to give to my cousins neighbor. Let me stop here to recompose myself. I cannot tell you how many times I have told this story and every time I do so I get emotional and cry. This is the true essence of the American People. Military or not they are ALL great wonderful generous and giving to no end. LT. Col. Merrill did not have to give that money. He did not have to ask other US military members to do that either. He and all the rest of them have their own families their own responsibilities their own needs He and the rest of them DONT MAKE MUCH TO START WITH. Yet they saw the need of that mother next door to my cousin a women theyve never met more important to their own. I cannot tell you how that made me feel then and since. Sharing this story gives me goosebumps now can you imagine what it made me feel back when it did happen in 2004 during the actual war? This is what America is made of; Greatness Nothing less! Every time I share my personal stories interacting with the true American spirit I always to want to shout America How Great Thou Art! After reading this piece do you blame me?,political,Facebook
More Common Sense on Gun Control - Charlie's Soapbox 8/9/19  Some of the Democrat presidential candidates wasted no time in blaming the mass shooting at the Walmart in El Paso on President Trump.  That is both dumb and stupid and tantamount to blaming all the police shootings on Barack Obama for his careless remarks about the police acting stupidly or blaming Bernie Sanders for the attempted murder of then Majority Whip Steve Scalise and other Republican lawmakers at a softball game practice because the perpetrator was one of his supporters or blaming the Dayton shooter because he was a supporter of Elizabeth Warren.  No this is simply political desperation by also-rans trying to get a little more face time on TV to bolster their faltering campaigns.  This attitude this approach and these kinds of opportunistic politicians are the very reason there has been no movement on gun legislation because law-abiding gun owners know that this kind of attitude that immediately grabs the low hanging fruit and never the roots of a problem skews to overkill that in reality does nothing about the real dilemma and ends up being a futile exhibition of asinine hyperbole and rhetoric about how the opposing side wants to see mass murders and school shootings.  Nobody with enough gray matter to tie their shoes really believes that the proponents of the second amendment want to see gun violence and that kind of gross incendiary dialogue is totally counterproductive to doing anything about sensible gun laws or the insanity on our streets.  Actually the first thing to do and what would make a world of difference would be to enforce existing gun laws the cities with the most stringent firearm laws have the highest murder rates.  Unscrupulous gun dealers and black-market gun dealers need to be taken off the streets and face serious jail time.  Secondly the very geniuses who want to blame Trump for El Paso advocate a policy that actually imports violent gang members and other criminals across our southern borders every day look at the statistics dealing with MS-13 and how many violent crimes have been committed by people who crossed into this country illegally.  The problem with getting legal gun owners on board is the governments habit of throwing the baby out with the bathwater and their give us an inch and well take a mile approach.  Actually the master plan on the radical side is an incremental outlawing of all privately-owned firearms second amendment be damned.  They oppose placing well-trained security personnel at schools probably because President Trump supports it.  There are enough qualified military veterans and off duty police officers to set and execute the kind of security it would take to make our schools much safer.  The difference in the murder rate in El Paso and the one in Dayton was due to the presence of police officers in Dayton who were on the scene in 30 seconds and brought the killer down before he could carry out the number of killings he undoubtedly planned to do.  Even if the anti-gun contingent had their ultimate way and were successful in removing legally owned guns in America nothing would be done about the illegally owned ones. One more law is not going to turn criminals into law-abiding citizens.  And even if they were successful in getting most of the illegal guns off the streets there would be a thriving black market the cartels in Mexico are very diverse and if theres big money involved they will find a way.  So where does that leave us?  Actually right back at square one where we started with the apparent need to deal with the facts not the fiction.  Lets expose the myths perpetrated by the anti-gun lobby.  First of all background checks.  In my home state of Tennessee we have a thorough background check system and not just the first time you purchase a firearm but every time.  Every state Ive bought a gun in have these same kinds of requirements especially for buying handguns and yes even at the gun shows youve heard so much about.  We cant have meaningful politically correct gun legislation police have to be given the latitude they need to clean up the violence in the streets and have to be backed by city hall state capitals and the federal government.  A mayor who cant even vigorously condemn throwing water on policemen carrying out their duty or has a let them destroy attitude or turns a blind eye to the crime in their cities for some ill-perceived political expediency are not servants of the people but self-serving political hacks part of the problem not the solution  The roots of our gun problem run through the political process the biased media the dealers who allow straw purchasing of firearms the alley dealers and the crime communitys black market.  One place it does not run is through the locked gun cabinets of the millions and millions of legal gun owners who have never used their guns for anything except sports and protection.  They have a right to own guns criminals dont apply the medicine to the diseased areas not the healthy ones.  What do you think?  Pray for the peace of Jerusalem.

Most main stream media outlets talke about COVID George Floyd and social unrest. This morning I thought I would make a change and listen to Fox and Friends. It is nice to start the morning with a laugh. There were three white people trying to explain why the idea of systemic racism is a far left con concept. After all the Police Officer that shot a gun but thought it was a taser was innocent of murder. It was an accident anyone could make. But the far left wants to call it systemic racism.  Here is my response to what they said. Yes it is systemic racism. You have a multitude of police officers pull over a black guy for a license plate light burnt out. Guns are drawn. Dont you think it was over kill? You have a multitude of Police Officers approach George Floyds car because of the accusation of counterfit $20 bill....with their guns drawn. Once again over kill. Do you not see it? I have been pulled over for speeding before. I was also pulled over at night while driving in a loaner car with license plates that were reported stollen. No guns drawn. In that incident the Police Officer said you dont look like someone that would drive a stollen car. What did that mean? Systemic Racism. This does not mean that the racial thoughts are conscience thought. It is a reactor-factor mindless action that is built 100% on training and instinct. Systemic Racism. Until Police and other people with power understand how they react differently to situations systemic racism will always win out.,political,Facebook
I apologize in advance for how long this will be. This will be post 1 of 3 and is in response to questions regarding the Sheriffs Office budget. I encourage each and every one of you to take the time to read it as I believe it will explain the budget process.  During election years it seems people come out and post comments on Facebook and do not give the complete story or say they can make a difference but never post their plan. I feel this is doing the citizens of this community a disservice. You must or should have all the facts so you can fully understand and make a better decision on who you want to vote for. I continue to try and be an open book and when I miss that target I own it and do my best to respond. I feel it is time for me to step in and give the citizens of this great community the complete story about the budget and its process and how it has been done with every Sheriff and what I have done since taking office in January 2017. First in order to do that I need to give you some knowledge about the budget.  We will start with the different types of budgets. There is a Schedule A B C and D. For the Sheriff Office we pretty much only use the Schedule A and B part of the budget. Now you ask what are the Schedule A and B budget? That is a great question.  The Schedule A budget is specific to personnel. All employees salary and benefits are paid out of the Schedule A budget to include any overtime. The Schedule B budget is specific to operations. This is the side of the budget that we use for equipment and other items that we must have in order to do our job. Some examples are purchasing vehicles training vests guns ammo etc. There are many things that we need to pay for out of the operation side in order to give the employees the equipment to safely do their jobs.  I cannot speak for other departments in regards to their budget processes but I will speak for how the Sheriffs Office budget request is determined.  The process usually starts in March. Once the process begins I work with our Chief of Operations Lieutenants and Sergeants to determine what direction we want to go in the upcoming year. After meeting these administrative leaders go back and work with their teams to prepare requests for their respective divisions. Once these requests are determined at the division level staff and I meet again to determine our Needs vs our Wants. This is kinda the same process of buying a vehicle. You anticipate you will have a specific amount of money but you also want XYZ in upgraded. You must determine what is essential and what is not. Our team does that each and every year.  After the request is completed the County Clerk schedules a day and time for us to go in front of the County Commissioners to present our official request. That is where the Commissioner begin a negotiation process to determine whether money is available to fund a full request or if there needs to be items trimmed from a budget request. It is the Commissioners that decide our budget for the upcoming fiscal year. Every leader asks for their essentials and their wants and as Sheriff we have done that. It is the funding authorities (Commissioners) role to determine if the requests and justifications are necessary and justified. If they dont believe so then the requests are not funded.  Elected Officials and Department Heads have operational control of their respective departments however the Commissioners have budget control for the county. So for someone to say the Sheriff has complete control is not a complete story. Yes a Sheriff answers directly to the people as an elected official but the Commissioners control the money side of everything. As Sheriff I can tell you that I havent always agreed with them however at the end of the day our amazing staff works within the budgeted amounts allocated to us by the Commissioners.  Since taking office we have worked with the Human Resources office to get the salaries of employees up. The HR office commissioned a study for all employees that work for Elmore County. This study gave the Commissioners a better picture as to where the County stood in pay throughout Idaho and a tool to use so they make pay more attractive which encourages retention.  With that being said there is only so much tax dollars to go around. With an increase in the Schedule A budget to raise employee wages the Schedule B (operations) had to be decreased or additional funds would come out of PILT. What is PILT? PILT stand for Payment in Lieu of Taxes. It is what the Federal Government gives out for federal land that is in the county and the county does not receive taxes on. That is a set amount. The county as a whole gets approximately 2.3 million dollar per year. Those funds are not guaranteed. The federal government has to determine each year whether they will continue to send out those funds.  Over the years the County has been able to keep some funds put in reserve however if we all do not do our part those funds can dry up. The County Clerk and Commissioners work very hard to ensure that does not happen. It is a concern when it is stated that excessive PILT funds are being used to offset/balance the Sheriffs Office budget.  Yes prior administrations did not take as much from PILT as my administration has but there were so many items that needed to be replaced including: outdated vests vehicles and adding additional deputies to increase coverage in the county. The commissioners supports and allocated the necessary resources for these safety enhancements for the betterment of the Sheriffs Office staff and the citizens that we serve.  Currently the Sheriffs Office get approximately 2.5 million dollar from taxes taken in from the community. To operate the Sheriffs Office on this amount would be almost impossible to do and would drastically reduce services and increase crimes in our county.  The Sheriffs Office operates out of the Justice Funds taxes. The Justice Fund accounts mostly cover the following offices for both Schedule A and B including: The Sheriffs office (Patrol Detectives Civil Division Overtime and Extra Help) Jail (Both Schedule A and B) Dispatch (Both Schedule A and B). Those areas are the main areas that use most of the tax and PILT dollars.  Our current budget for the main section of the budget (FY2019 - October 1 2019 thru September 30 2020) (Patrol and Detectives only etc.) has a Schedule A (Personnel Overtime etc.) is roughly $4.8 million dollars. To make any cuts to that side of the budget we would have to lay off deputies and dispatchers. I truly believe that the Sheriffs Office must have all employees we currently have to meet our current call volume answer your 911 calls and jail staff to cover all shifts. Without adequate staffing we will not be able to serve and protect the community as we all took an oath to do.  Our Schedule B budget (Patrol and Detectives etc. only) (operations) is approximately $1.5 million dollars for the current fiscal year. With increases to Schedule A budgets the Schedule B budget should definitely be looked at to determine whether decreases are in order to try and balance it out. This is only one section of the complete budget that the Sheriff Office uses.  The Sheriffs Office does bring in revenue dollars to offset some of our budget costs. Examples include: Housing inmates from the State U.S. Marshal holds etc. These revenue sources vary from year to year.  As you can see it is not an easy task for the Sheriffs Office Administration County Clerk and County Commissioners. Hard decisions have to be made by everyone in order to keep our County running.  I know this is a lot of information but feel it is important information. I will be releasing a few more posts that I believe will help provide insight in the Sheriffs Office budgets.,political,Facebook
Pardon my absence. Life has been happening. I wrote the following though the list is incomplete:  Leftists in their worldview decide what they want to be true act as if its true and demand that you act as if its true as well. Understand that leftists are religious fanatics and label all of those who oppose the leftist faith as racists white supremacists misogynists etc. They will then do all that they can to destroy the lives and families of those who do not follow the faith.  Here are some prime examples of untrue things that the left holds as self-evident truths.  A biological male becomes female when he says hes female Biological men have no advantage over women in sports The number of genders cannot be counted Nearly everything in life can be free The government can provide for all of societys needs All whites are racist no other race is racist Blacks who disagree with the faith are white supremacists Math is racist The English Language is racist. Spelling and grammar are racist Forcing children of color to learn the above is racist Everyone is an oppressor or oppressed. There are no people just trying to live life. You can raise the taxes on the rich and they wont leave Raising taxes on businesses will create jobs Building a business is greed Taking other peoples stuff isnt greed Abortion is a matter of my body my choice Vaccines arent a matter of my body my choice Voter IDs are racist Covid passports arent racist Small children should learn about the intricacies of sex including things like anal sex 18-year-olds shouldnt own guns 16-year-olds should be able to vote 14-year-olds should be able to get abortions without parental knowledge 3-year-olds should decide what gender they are If you take guns from law-abiding citizens criminals will stop shooting people Not arresting people for committing crimes will lower crime rates The protests that caused many deaths and billions in destruction were peaceful November 6 in DC was an attempted insurrection by violent extremists (though none had weapons) The biggest problem in the US military is white supremacy Organized Christianity is evil Orthodox Judaism is evil Islam is good and peaceful Israel is an oppressor.

WE HAVE LET OUR APPETITES get the best of us:  I embrace what it means to be an American. I share its ideals of freedom liberty and equality; although in practice this has not been the universal American experience. Neither has it been the American experience with the rest of the world. The arrogance attached to the perceived superiority of our thought has perversely enabled us to self-righteously oppress those who stray from our dogma. But setting all of this aside there is another flaw in our character which will likely lead to our undoing.  We have let our appetites get the best of us; we abuse our freedoms. Because one is free to drink 24 cans of Coca Cola that does not mean that one does so no matter how good it taste. One must exercise discipline if not it will be imposed on us. We consume at rates way beyond what is needed; it is not healthy for the planet our bodies or our spirits. Yet we do so the market our culture tells us to do so. So despite the damage we freely and without discipline satisfy our basest physical desires. The planet our bodies and our spirits will eventually impose limits on this freedom. Our greatest strength the ability to speak our minds exercised without discipline has turned the Country into a coliseum of hate-spewing tirades against those with whom we disagree. Now pressure mounts for censorship. Our freedom to own guns not checked by any personal discipline has turned into the stockpiling of weapons and ammunition which when combined with the above mentioned hate creates a climate of fear which encourages conformity to a side and limits authentic and reasonable dialogue. Our freedoms in enterprise have gone beyond the bounds of creativity and appropriate reward to the craving and worship of wealth without concern for those who get trampled on in the process of wealth creation. This in turn has sparked a backlash which threatens social chaos and limited freedoms.  The unexercised discipline of our freedoms has led us down a path towards anarchy which if we persist in traveling will land us in a world in which none of us is free. Whether this occurs through reactionary authoritarian government rule or through warring anarchal militias it does not matter; nobody is free in a state of war. Freedom is a great thing but freedom exercises its own boundaries. Either we learn to exercise restraint from within ourselves or someone will exercise it for us. The manner in which restraint is imposed will determine the violence associated with it.,political,Facebook
"The crime rate is rapidly rising.Blue run states are defunding their police and the rest of the police forces are resigning in droves.They have been vilified & discouraged to the point where they would rather not be part of the police & part of law & order. Those who commit crimes are let free even when captured to repeat criminal activities all over again.The real criminals are given a free pass while the democrats are creating the fear of a non existent ""white supremacist'""fear. It has all bee planned from almost 4 plus years ago & is leading to the destruction of this country. All this is done with the goal of the socialist fascist democrats to keep power. It is not about America common sense nor law & order nor justice. It is all about power. There is no civilized society without a police force. They are now trying to weaponize and politicize the armed forces. It was embarrassing to watch & listen to Mark A. Milley Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff the other day. He is the highest ranking military officer. Biden has held office for almost 50 years and his party has controlled government as long or longer. Why has this been allowed to exist if it is as bad as they say it is. Obama was President for 8 years and Biden his VP for those 8 years. Why all of a sudden this cancel culture Critical race theory racism and the appearance of so much white supremacy. Did the democrats just realize this ? No this is all made up to change the country once & for all for something that has been tried and failed every time in history & wherever it was tried. Innocent people are being harassed and intimidated while the criminals and the guilty are being let free. Guns are not killers but instruments to kill in the wrong criminal hands.Cars are for transportation but can also be used to kill just like steak knives and box cutters. If this country wanted to select or elect anyone to destroy it including the strongest most powerful countries in the world they would not have done as good a job as this mad man and his VP. God help America and give its people the courage & unity to stop the destruction of the republic. Little more of this insanity & there will be nothing worth saving !",political,Facebook
One question that frequently comes up at Candidate forums is Why are you qualified to serve on County Council? My answer to that incorporates both objective and subjective criteria. For the former I would point to my 10 years of service in municipal government. In my four years as an Auditor I deconstructed municipal operations to ensure that there was a proper stewardship of resources. For six years as a Councilman I was able to develop and implement Borough policies. As Finance Committee Chair I was charged with spearheading the budget process making the guns or butter choices to ensure the Boroughs fiscal health. In my professional career I have been a Municipal Bond Trustee Financial Advisor Public Finance Analyst and CPA all of which has provided the background for a smooth transition to County Government.  On the subjective side I would point to my personal history which has given me a unique perspective. I am the first generation son of a man who had his parents and 9 of 10 siblings slaughtered by Nazis and found himself in a concentration camp. Through incredible courage and resolve he escaped came to the United States and was a UAW machinist until his untimely passing. My mother raised two sons as a domestic and saw both earn graduate degrees. A product of public housing in Westmorland County I worked my way through college and graduate school tending bar. After a successful career in Global Banking where I had the opportunity to work with clients in 50 countries I was downsized and pivoted to work advocating for the Special Needs Community. I have been very fortunate to have been given opportunities and I truly believe that the purpose of government is to lift constituents up and enable them to reach their potential.  I have every confidence that my background has prepared me for this role and respectfully ask for your support,political,Facebook

MSB's Black Lives Matter Platform - Part 1: Criminal Justice Reform 1. We clearly have a demand both for police liaisons and community advocates to meet and work in the same local PTA (parent-teacher association) type system. 2. We need public defender insurance (including bail) to bail out underwater defenders so they can be more effective; imagine if you didn't have to worry finding a lawyer or paying bail. 3. We need compassionate prisons without solitary confinement with programming and quality mental health treatment; alternatively shut down the prisons! What if we had breathalyzer activated cars to prevent drunk driving in the first place; or fingerprint activated guns to prevent gun violence? What if we didn't need prisons at all to prevent crime? Dream big! 4. Post-conviction relief legal clinics through law schools need to be established in the event that a frightened person feels they ought to offer an unnecessary compromise plea so that the offender's sentence can be reduced to something rational after incarceration. 5. We need better reintegration strategies after prison including mentorship and post-release programming to prevent falling into old habits. Maybe a year straight up house/apartment arrest with shuttle buses to community colleges and/or places of employment as part of the process.,political,Facebook

Time for another controversial post The Democrats are really screwing up proposing another assault weapons ban. There are way too many Americans that own these weapons and that genie will never be put back into that bottle. SCOTUS would almost assuredly block any legislation trying to roll back gun rights in this way and the powerful gun lobby would use it to defeat anyone supporting such legislation especially in Republican primaries. There is however a lot more support for restricting the ability to acquire guns by people who would pose a danger to society. It is considered reasonable to restrict peoples ability to drive on public roadways purchase alcohol or even to vote. You actually have to prove you are capable of driving a car in order to receive a license. You are required to show that license when asked to prove you are permitted to drive. With alcohol you are required to show ID to prove you are old enough to purchase it. Voter ID laws require you to show a state issued ID in order to exercise your constitutional right to vote. The constitutional right to vote can be taken away in certain instances. States should be able to pass Shooter ID laws in order to purchase firearms or ammunition. The constitutional right to bear arms should be able to be revoked if a person is a danger to himself or society. States have an obligation to protect their citizens and if that means placing reasonable safety measures in place to restrict the right to bear arms from someone who is likely to use those weapons in a way that harms or threatens others then responsible gun rights advocates should support that. If howeveryou believe the second amendment states no restrictions whatsoever can be placed on guns then the right to vote also cannot have any impediment imposed upon it.,political,Facebook
Calling all Home Chefs and SC Politicians!!  Looks like a challenge has been made and accepted...at our February meeting on Thursday February 13th Rodney Berry from Rep Tom Rice's office will be speaking to us...and judging the First Annual Chili Taste-off of the Marion County Republican Party.  First Vice Chair of the SCGOP Cindy Risher has assured me that her chili is the best. However newest member of the MCRP Ron Elliott seems to think his is the best. Unfortunately for them both I already know that Marion County's Executive Committeeman Robert Lumpkin's chili is absolutely the best.  The only way to settle this is to have Rodney be the judge. Wonder if anyone else in the SCGOP has the nerves to enter the contest. Do you?  This will be a fundraiser for the Marion County Republican Party with more details to follow. If you aren't a chili maker but think your cornbread is the best bring it with you to the meeting. Let's make this fun delicious and helpful to the MCRP...and help turn Marion County Red!!!  Sign-in begins at 5:45pm and the meeting will begin at 6pm at Liberty Guns & Equipment 139 S Main Street in Mullins. There will be a brief amount of business discussed and information given by Rodney Berry before we get down to the real business of deciding once and for all: Whose Chili Will Reign Supreme?,political,Facebook
Where are all the alpha men gone?  By: Columnist Kalynn Brazeal  I stood looking at the selection for what felt like hours. Surely replacing windshield wipers cant be this difficult. I text the husband and stood there awaiting an answer. I just needed plain ole windshield wipers yet there was nothing but options. Stealth? Universal? Latitude? Flex? As I stood there patiently waiting directions from the man in charge i.e. my husband I began to notice the number of men roaming the isles. Obviously its an auto department so there will be men. It wasnt their presence that surprised me but what they were doing. All these men were waiting their turn to ask questions about oil tire pressure tools and like me wipers.  The two store employees were using a computer to tell them how much tire pressure should be in a certain tire. Which oil was best for a certain engine. How to use a socket wrench (seriously a socket wrench) and when my husband finally called me back to tell me which wipers to get I erupted into an emotional gush of I kinda love how you know that.  I thought guys came with a manual that told them the steps of changing your own oil straddling a ditch of in the garage. Teenage boys arent pre-programmed with minor mechanic knowledge? Life has changed and with it the alpha male has disappeared. For the most part Ill keep mine thank you very much.  Men were taught to use guns and hunt from a small age. The ability to fix a clunker car was learned by necessity. Water pump in your car out? No problem Ill grab one from the auto parts store and fix it tonight after dinner. Or in our case at 4 am in the morning when he came off duty from the night before.  They were taught from the beginning that their shoulders had to be broad to carry the weight of their future family. Some cases that duty came early as they needed to step up and care for their mother and siblings. They speak respectfully to their mothers and thus the other women in their lives. They learned the hard way that respect if earned not given. Men were reminded that courage was expected and to not back down from a fight. Whether this was standing up for their country and serving in a war regardless of the politics or putting a bully in their place. They stood. They stood for the small the weak and the softer.  They serve. Serving their churches by being involved in the leadership and attending with their families. They serve their families by putting their needs first. A roof clothing and food was provided. Children were read to from the bible before bed and tucked in with hugs. They serve their wives by standing strong willing to help with the burden of life.  They have purpose in life and work hard. Understanding the difference between using their hands for good and evil. They complete things and often times they lead by example down in the ditch digging away with their employees.  We dont have to grow our own food anymore to survive and we dont have to have large families to avoid hiring help on the family farm/ranch. Technology has added so much to make our lives easier but at the same time its taken away the reality of the alpha male. The need to physically work hard for a days living doesnt literally apply to everyone anymore. Now gyms are full of those men looking for the physical outlet of aggression.  You dont measure a man on his ability to level up in electronic games. Hand and eye coordination meant he could hit a fast pitch effortlessly. He could fix anything you could break which is a huge plus in a marriage like mine (I break everything). A call to a plumber A/C or Heat man meant that the problem was serious and outside of his range. It wasnt a flushed sock or a filter that needs replaced.  We have become a generation that has strayed far from the lives that our parents grew up in. Somewhere out there surely there are still families raising boys to grow up to be men. Keep bucking society and raise a man worth knowing a man worth respecting. A man you can count on. Knowing that I have two daughters that one day will hopefully marry. I pray they find an all elusive alpha man.  -- Kalynn Brazeal is a conservative Christian wife/mom/country girl carrying around an MBA several decades of business experience and a strong opinion.

Less than a week ago a shooter killed eight people in a series of attacks on spas in Atlanta Georgia. In all there have been at least seven mass shootings in the past week across the United States. When will the people of this country and our legislators respond with effective gun safety legislation?  Here is what I believe to be needed:  While respecting the Second Amendment the federal government should take the following permissible gun violence/safety actions to prevent mass shootings: (a) expand and enforce more rigorous universal background checks in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) -- including by closing gun show online sales Charleston (a/k/a default proceed delayed denial or 3-day) stalker (dating partner) and hate crime loopholes; (b) revive the Federal Assault Weapons Ban and add certain weapons readily susceptible of conversion to fully or near-fully automatic (in particular the AR-15); (c) likewise ban high-capacity magazines and bump stocks; (d) restore the Obama-era regulation requiring the Social Security Administration to send records of severely mentally ill beneficiaries to NICS; (e) prohibit suspected terrorists from purchasing guns (no-fly-no-buy); (f) repeal the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act which provides unique legal protections shielding dealers and manufacturers that negligently sell or manufacture guns; (g) get rid of the 2004 ""Tiahrt Amendments"" which restrict release of gun trace data except to law enforcement officers or prosecutors when related to criminal investigations; (h) oppose the Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act repeatedly introduced in Congress which would allow any individual licensed to carry a concealed firearm in one state to do so in any other state allowing concealed carry; (i) fund gun safety/violence and mental health research; and (j) require reporting of stolen weapons.  Such measures should be added to existing prohibitions against various categories of potentially dangerous people including criminals (particularly violent felons) dishonorably discharged military personnel and mentally ill persons. With respect to the last-mentioned the United States has a broader problem than guns per se. While not the most headlined over half of all mass shootings in this country involve intimate partners or family members. Also the suicide rate keeps rising precipitously and over half of the suicides involve guns. Thus we have a deadly combination of a mental health epidemic and a gun culture problem.",political,Facebook
"Getting The Facts Straight  A Statement From Leigh Dollar  I am pleased to report that I have kept my firm commitment to run a positive campaign and not engage in negative comments during this election. However I will not allow misinformation about myself or the Dollar For Mayor campaign to go uncorrected. In recent days I have learned that three completely false statements about me have been communicated during the campaign. Here are the facts about those issues.  Party Affiliation  First of all there are NO party candidates in the Guntersville election period. Municipal elections are non-partisan as they should be. That is why I have made no mention of party affiliation during my campaign (nor doing my work as mayor). However I am proud to be a Republican. I hold strong family Christian and conservative fiscal values. There is no room for party politics to divide a small community. As Mayor I serve all the citizens of Guntersville regardless of political affiliation. It is vital that our community work together to provide the best quality of life as possible without the distraction of party politics.   Guns and the 2013 Emergency Ordinance  The second issue is blatant misleading statement that I am not a 2nd Amendment supporter. This is based on a misunderstanding almost eight years ago (explained below) that was quickly resolved by the Mayor and City Council. It is unfortunate that someone has chosen to intentionally misrepresent that situation in the current election.  Let me be clear  I am a firearm owner myself the wife of an avid outdoorsman and mother to three boys that love to hunt. Trust me when I say that I am in no way a supporter of taking guns.  The issue in question arose from an ""emergency ordinance"" provided by the State of Alabama for municipalities to pass at the local level. The ordinance was simply to allow city governments to take quicker action in the aftermath of a disaster such as the April 27 2011 tornado outbreak. The lengthy ordinance included wording that although already part of Alabama State Law was viewed as unfavorable toward gun rights. We listened to our citizens' concerns and quickly removed the ordinance from consideration. I would never use the position of mayor to infringe on our communitys rights.  Walking Trail Tunnel  A new crossing at Highway 69 and Sunset Drive to connect the walking trails and parks is only a concept at this point. The City is looking at all options for a safer crossing than currently available. This is a state highway and anything done would have to go through ALDOT. At this point we have simply asked the engineers and State to look into the feasibility and different options. No city money has been budgeted for this project and if it goes forward it would be subject to detailed discussion and public input and funding availability.",political,Facebook
"DIVORCE AGREEMENT  THIS IS INCREDIBLY WELL-PUT AND I CAN HARDLY BELIEVE IT'S WRITTEN BY A STUDENT!!! WHATEVER HE RUNS FOR I'LL VOTE FOR HIM.  Dear American liberals leftists social progressives socialists Marxists and Obama supporters et al:  We have stuck together since the late 1950s for the sake of the kids but the whole of this latest election process has made me realize that I want a divorce. I know we tolerated each other for many years for the sake of future generations but sadly this relationship has clearly run its course.  Our two ideological sides of America cannot and will not ever agree on what is right for us all so let's just end it on friendly terms. We can smile and chalk it up to irreconcilable differences and go our own way.  Here is our separation agreement:  Our two groups can equitably divide up the country by land mass each taking a similar portion. That will be the difficult part but I am sure our two sides can come to a friendly agreement. After that it should be relatively easy! Our respective representatives can effortlessly divide other assets since both sides have such distinct and disparate tastes.  We don't like redistributive taxes so you can keep them.  --You are welcome to the liberal judges and the ACLU.  --Since you hate guns and war we'll take our firearms the cops the NRA and the military.  --We'll take the nasty smelly oil industry and the coal mines and you can go with wind solar and bio-diesel.  --You can keep Oprah Whoopi Bill Maher Michael Moore and Rosie O'Donnell. You are however responsible for finding a bio-diesel vehicle big enough to move all five of them.  --We'll keep capitalism greedy corporations pharmaceutical companies Wal-Mart and Wall Street.  --You can have your beloved lifelong welfare dwellers food stamps homeless homeboys hippies druggies and illegal aliens.  --We'll keep the hot Alaskan hockey moms greedy CEOs and rednecks.  --We'll keep Bill OReilly and Bibles and give you NBC and Hollywood.  --You can make nice with Iran and Palestine and we'll retain the right to invade and hammer places that threaten us.  --You can have the peaceniks and war protesters.  --When our allies or our way of life are under assault we'll help provide them security.  --We'll keep our Judeo-Christian values.  --You are welcome to Islam Scientology Humanism political correctness and Shirley McLaine. You can also have the UN. but we will no longer be paying the bill.  --We'll keep the SUVs pickup trucks and oversized luxury cars. You can take every Volt and Leaf you can find.  --You can give everyone health care if you can find any practicing doctors.  --We'll keep ""The Battle Hymn of the Republic"" and ""The National Anthem.""  --I'm sure you'll be happy to substitute ""Imagine"" ""I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing"" ""Kum Baya"" or ""We Are the World.""  --We'll practice trickle-down economics and you can continue to give trickle-up poverty your best shot.  --Since it often so offends you we'll keep our history our name and our flag.  Would you agree to this? If so please pass it along to other like-minded liberal and conservative patriots and if you do not agree just hit delete. In the spirit of friendly parting I'll bet you might think about which one of us will need whose help in 15 years.  Sincerely  John J. Wall Law Student and an American  P.S. Also please take George Clooney Ted Turner Sean Penn Martin Short Charlie Sheen Barbra Streisand and (Hanoi) Jane Fonda with you.  P.P.S. And you won't have to press 1 for English when you call our country.  Forward This Every Time You Get It !  Let's Keep This Going Maybe Some Of It Will Start to Sink in.",political,Facebook

Common Sense and Understanding vs. Obstinance and Politics Charlie's Soapbox 12/10/18  As one who I feel has at least a cursory knowledge of both sides of the gun control issue I offer my humble opinion of the situation and the seemingly implacable positions that have been taken up by each.  In the first place I will not deal with the fringe elements of either camp here as I feel that it is unproductive and you cannot reason with anybody who doesnt have the ability to see at least a modicum of both sides of an argument but just to the  hopefully - reasonable folks who really want to address the unreasonable amount of gun violence that brutalizes our nation.  Okay a few words to those of you who approach this many-sided conundrum from a pie in the sky idealistic direction.  If you were able to confiscate everything that fires a projectile short of an air rifle you will BY NO MEANS do away with violence in America because the violent will always find a way to do violence with whatever weapon at hand.  For instance there have been almost forty-thousand knife attacks in the UK and Wales the first six months of 2018 and for a nation that has not allowed private gun ownership in many years there were 2544 cases of gun crime in London from April 2016-April 2017 according to BBC and there have been almost twenty-five hundred gun crimes in London in this year alone.  I know everybody has heard the old phrase when you outlaw guns only outlaws will have guns. I know I know its been overused and misused but stop and consider for a moment.  Is there anybody foolish enough to think that even if all law-abiding citizens would honestly and voluntarily turn over every firearm they own that the violent gangs street thugs psychopaths and anti-American political fanatics would surrender theirs?  Can you disarm the Mexican drug cartels organized crime or ferret out the groups of insurrectionists like the ones David Koresh led to their deaths in Waco Texas a few years ago?  I also understand and sympathize with the apprehensions of the honest gun owners in America who keep guns for sport and protection and who fervently and rightfully believe that their rights to do so are protected by the second amendment of the constitution.  But the second amendment goes a step farther than just sport shooting and personal protection it was amended to the constitution by men who had just stood up to and defeated a foreign and oppressive country who tried to annex America make it a vassal nation to the British Crown to conceive and enforce our laws take away our individual rights and sovereignty.  So the Second Amendment intends for American citizens to be able to defend themselves from oppression terrorism and invasion.  It was said that a famous Japanese Admiral was asked after the destruction of our Pacific Naval fleet at Pearl Harbor why Japan would not land troops on the West Coast of America and invade.  His answer Because there would be a rifle behind every blade of grass.  With the laxity of our immigration policies and the porous condition of our southern border there is a near certainty there are sleeper cells of Islamic Terrorists in our country and should they decide to take it to the streets if all guns were confiscated what would we fend them off with water pistols?  The other side of the coin and the reticence of legal gun owners to even discuss anything that smacks of gun control is simple distrust of government and their give em an inch and theyll take a mile overkill and the fact that most of them know about as much about guns as a hog knows about an airplane.  So how do these two seemingly intransigent groups ever even have a civilized conversation about our gun problems?  First of all gun control is a misnomer because in reality its not the gun but the person holding it that has to be controlled and that involves opening a very complicated convoluted and controversial can of creepy crawly things involving civil rights and a large gaggle of ACLU lawyers.  In my opinion the first thing that needs to be done is for the two sides to find some common ground which is a foregone conclusion because what everybody wants is to keep guns out of the hands of people use them to hurt and kill innocent people.  If that can be accomplished actually the big problem is a series of smaller problems and should be dealt with individually.  Basically a lot of the problems could be solved by enforcing laws that already exist.  Unscrupulous and illegal gun dealers need to be dealt with and thats a good starting place to put sharper teeth in current laws shut these people down and get them off the street.  Eliminate the ability of straw buyers who buy guns and pass them along illegally as is the case in the Obama-Holder Fast and Furious debacle.  Harden security at our schools by whatever measures it takes to keep children safe and if this requires armed personnel and metal detectors so be it.  I know I have just scraped the tip of a very large iceberg here but at least it gives us something to think about.  As a lifetime member of the NRA and a legal gun owner all my adult life I believe that all reasonable interested parties would be glad to see a civilized and reasonable dialogue started on this most pressing issue.  What do you think?  Pray for our troops our police and the peace of Jerusalem.  God Bless America  Charlie Daniels,political,Facebook
Oligarchs Theocrats and Fascists: The GOPs Unholy Marriage of Convenience An Essay by Daniel Shaw  What exactly does todays Republican Party the Party that steadfastly protects and enables Donald Trump the First Kleptocrat want for the USA? Ye shall know them by their fruits.  First as befits their importance what do Oligarchs want? In Paul Krugmans essential phrase they want to comfort the comfortable and afflict the afflicted. The Ayn Rand-adjacent raison detre of the Oligarchs is contempt for the Poors. The Oligarchs are self-styled bermenschen and like all malignant narcissists they confer upon themselves superiority and entitlement. The rest of us can eat their dust as they drive by faster and faster leaving us the help limping along the highway. The deregulation demanding union-busting pay no taxes gonzo Oligarchs with their phallic monuments to their utter selfishness rising higher and higher closer and closer to the sun rule the world now; and they own the GOP.  What do Theocrats want? To overturn Roe. v. Wade because fear of and contempt for women is now called pro-life. Theocrats want Christian Dominionism a country and a world ruled by Biblical law not the laws of men. They want Patriarchy and make it White please. They want gays to stay in the closet a secret hideaway for many Theocrats themselves. They love Israel because they need to make sure its there when The Rapture comes. The Theocrats love the GOP some of whom are bona fide Theocrats themselves. Other Republican pols pander to the Theocrats because hey whats a little misogyny homophobia and shredding of the Constitution if it gets you the votes?  And what do the Fascists want? Guns first and foremost all the guns in the hands of anyone with hands. They want to Make America White Again with guns.  What fuels the passion of this infernal mnage  trois to whom only Dante could do justice? Why the Right-Wing Echo Chamber a rare and powerful aphrodisiac that makes pawns feel powerful led by its King Rupert Murdoch the man whom Joseph Goebbels would admire most were Goebbels still with us in the flesh and not just in spirit.  The Republican Party provides an umbrella for the Oligarchs the Theocrats and the Fascists joined in an unholy marriage of convenience. Together aside from how assiduously the Republican politicians work to turn Bedford Falls into Pottersville so that only the wealthiest get to have a wonderful life in the USA they steadfastly oversee the Grand Project that is their pride and joy: the death of Planet Earth.  Sorry Woody Guthrie: this land is their land to consume exhaust and discard. Yup. It happened here.,political,Facebook
Last night I listened to Jacksonville high school students talk about how gun violence is shaping their lives - how its changing their experiences at school and elsewhere and what theyd like to see done. They had different ideas and opinions but one thing was unanimous they want action and they want to their neighborhoods and communities to be involved in creating the solutions - not just to be told what the city is doing or not doing.  I sat down with Sheriff Mike Williams last week to discuss this issue and others threatening our safety as a city. It was a long conversation - over an hour and a half and I appreciate Sheriff Williams taking the time to help me understand how his organization is approaching both organizational challenges like diversity recruiting retention and staffing and also operational challenges like training and stolen weapons. Did you know that we average more than one gun stolen out of a vehicle per day in Jax? As the Sheriff said people do not steal guns to put in their gun collection. I also spent some time last month riding along with one of our Zone 4 officers on a night shift to see first hand what is going on in our district every day.  Safety is a basic need. Its the starting point for each of our lives - first we must feel safe before we can begin to thrive - and thats true for our city as whole. Its a basic need but not a basic problem. We need a holistic approach - incorporating crime prevention education community engagement and job training and development along with more traditional crime reduction programs.  I look forward to talking to you about what you are seeing in your neighborhoods what most concerns you and in some cases is literally keeping you up at night.,political,Facebook
"""Gallows Humor: The Coronavirus Joke Collection""  How do you identify a person with the Coronavirus? Take off his mask.  In baseball the Houston Astros are actually pushing for crowd bans--so that they don't get jeered for their cheating.  On St. Patrick's Day the Irish are now encouraged to only fist bump not kiss the Blarney Stone.  What do you call the Coronavirus if it turns deadly?...The Coroner-virus.

Germany has shut its borders....And to bolster the health of the citizens in its capital Germany is also planning to build a Berlin wall...  There's been such a run on toiletries that convicts can no longer get the bars of soap to make the fake guns for prison breakouts....;)  In a compromise movie theaters will remain open for live audiences but only silent films will be shown...:)  Whats the best way to fight off the virus?...Ask your local D.A. to indict you then ask for Immunity.  Banks are warning that the Coronavirus can be transmitted through dollar bills that those afflicted have handledThe obvious solution to this is money laundering. ;)  Those downplaying the Coronavirus scare are simply washing their hands of it.  Unlike the NBA which quickly suspended its season the NHL tried to have it both ways by suspending and continuing its games at the same time--by putting them on ice...;)  Stone masons confined to work due to the virus face a Quarrytine.

Platform - This is evolving constantly via input from residents and local activists!  Additionally everything that currently is on here already can be paid for excluding taxes degree requirements and technically excluding wage increases. I think by July or August I will release what I consider the People's Budget using the proposed Fiscal 2021 budget totals(operating and capital).

Poverty Erasure and Community Enhancement (PEACE) Zones  Each year $150 million previously in the police budget will be split into six $25 million direct investments into economically-challenged and environmentally-challenged communities - 24 communities over four years. That means **$600 million** in direct investments over a four-year term. Each community will receive an additional $1 million in the following year (see below).  Breakdown $9 million in RFPs and matching grants for home renovation deconstruction and construction of homes - Goal of 100 new/revitalized homes in each community (Avg.$90000 toward each home) All homes must have reflective roofing or green roofing Homes offered to residents at 30-60% AMI with priority given to residents in community $1 million in subsidies (up to $800/mo) for rent (or mortgage) and utilities ($400/mo) (for each of the first two years of a lease) --15% of homes must have ADA-compliant exteriors and interiors specifically bathrooms $3 million in small business grants (including matching grants) $3 million into complete streets $1.5 million for a co-op grocery store $3 million toward a community center $2.5 million in permeable sidewalks/surfaces $2 million for a mental health facility  First Six Communities: 1.

Park Heights/Park Circle - $25 million into .86 sq. miles  ***The $1 million in rent and utility subsidies is akin to the Federal Housing Administration's federally-backed loans for white Americans beginning in the 1930s to increase homeownership. Unfortunately this was not accessible to black Americans. This arrangement permits private homebuilders a boost to their business and owners are assured on-time payments to help in their profit-making.***  Further these investments will attract additional investments from private sources potentially doubling the overall amount of money funneled into the community. Ideally from a housing perspective we'd see a matched $9 million to build homes for people in the 70%-90% AMI range - creating desperately-needed mixed-income neighborhoods  ECONOMY  Living Wage Policy - $18/hr by 2025 January 2022 - $14.50 January 2023 - $16.00 January 2024 - $17.50 January 2025 - $18.00 ***Business owners often assert that they are unable to raise wages this significantly for their workers and will have to pass it on to their patrons. THIS ALREADY HAPPENS! Jobs dependent on tips for example are the first subsidy patrons provide and the second is government assistance (SNAP EITC TANF Medicaid) to make ends meet. 52% of workers in the country utilize at least one of those programs.

NEW SC LAWS now in effect: 1. Open Carry of Guns 2. Slower Traffic Keep Right,political,Facebook
"Letter to Virginia State Legislators.  Dear Representative  Please do NOT pass any additional firearm ban laws. Simply enforce ALL the laws that are already in effect.  We do NOT have a firearm problem. We have a broken family problem. 75% of black families are broken and fatherless. 78% of the prison population is black. The majority of gun crime is black on black in only a few cities. Yet only 13% of Americans are black.  We have a mental health crisis in America. 60% of firearm deaths are suicide. There are 70000 opioid deaths per year; 3-times the rate of firearm suicides.  Yet in Virginia there is legislation to ban AK-47s & AR-15s which are semi-automatic rifles and fire at the same rate as semi-automatic handguns. You might be surprised to hear that there were only 62 rifle homicides in Virginia last year; this includes the AR & AK assault rifle.  There is NO such thing as an assault rifle. There is NO difference between an assault rifle and any other firearm except they look scarier. All firearms once fired at someone constitute the crime of assault.  Another interesting fact based on population rate Illegal aliens commit half the firearm homicides. The US population is about 320 million with illegal aliens making up 10% of the population (30 million) and committing 10% of all firearm homicides. Therefore illegal aliens commit half the firearm homicides on a population rate basis.  Now that we put things into proper context with the previous facts. Please do not legislate any further gun laws. Please also take into consideration the following additional facts that also do NOT support more gun control laws.  All the facts demonstrate the need to lessen gun restrictions for law abiding individuals and eliminate gun free zones so innocent people can protect themselves and others. Good people with guns are NOT the problem. Good people with guns are needed for protection from bad people with guns based on our US Constitution.  Our US & Virginia Constitutions State Code & Supreme Court say ""..right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed."" ; military should be governed by civil power.  militia shall consist of all able-bodied residents of Virginia who are citizens of the United States. Thats us.  There are 8.5 million Virginians. 2.8 million people of ALL political parties own firearms. Majority of homes have firearms. Of the 60000 Deaths In Virginia last year ONLY 340 were firearm homicides ZERO in my James City County. The Virginia firearm homicide rate is ONLY .004%. You have a better chance of getting struck by lightening than murdered with a gun. Virginia has the 4th lowest violent crime rate in the nation because un-infringed gun ownership is a deterrent.  Virginia doesnt have a firearm problem. Dangerous cities have a firearm-ban problem. Radical special interest groups falsely blame gun violence on law abiding Citizens in order to disguise their agenda of power money & control. In the US Annually gun owners prevent 2.5 million crimes. 90% of gun crime takes place in gun free zones. Criminals dont follow laws. If gun rights are taken away Virginians cant defend themselves.  State Representatives you have a duty & took an oath to uphold our Constitution. Since law enforcement does NOT have a duty to protect Virginians and government CANNOT guarantee our protection please do not do anything to infringe on Virginians rights to protect themselves with any semi-automatic weapon they choose to be best for them.  Over 91% of Virginia jurisdictions have already committed to protecting the 2nd Amendment with various forms of a 2nd Amendment Sanctuary or Constitution Resolution endorsed by many Sheriffs with their willingness to deputize citizens in order to fulfill their oaths to the same Constitution guaranteeing that the right to bear arms SHALL NOT be infringed; so citizens can protect themselves and assist law enforcement by deterring or preventing crime. This action sends a resounding message to preserve our Constitutional Rights and keep Virginia safe & secure.  If you choose not to follow the law and the will of the people you will be wasting ALL of your legislative time and your Virginia budget will be tied up in court battles for the next two years until you are NOT re-elected.  If you would like to debate these facts I am available any time for a non-emotional sensible factual discussion.",political,Facebook
My campaign has just submitted my completed questionnaire to the Chicago Sun-Times. Im sharing my responses below:  Thomas J Wilda Running for the 5th Congressional District seat in Illinois Green Party Social Worker PhD Facebook/Twitter/Instagram: @TomWilda2020 1 . Are you satisfied with the federal governments response to the COVID-19 pandemic? Why or why not? What grade would you give President Donald Trump for his handling of the pandemic and why? This pandemic was not taken seriously from the beginning. The failed response began before the pandemic hit with the reduction and near elimination of the CDC staff. Lack of equipment can be blamed on poor management and years of depending on labor camps in China to produce the equipment. President Trump failed to enact the Production Defense Act failed to abide by CDC guidelines failed to give help to the states in following CDC guidelines. We are left with the worse response to his crisis in the world the most cases the most deaths. Our country gets an F for our response. 2. What should the federal government do to stimulate economic recovery from the pandemic shutdowns? There is an immediate need for a UBI (Universal Basic Income) for every adult citizen in the country. $3000 a month is needed. For those that do not need it it can be taxed back. People need to pay rents and mortgages. Businesses that were doing well before the pandemic need to have payroll and expense support so that they will be viable after the pandemic. Medicare for all must be enacted to ensure medical coverage for citizens and payments to hospitals medical facilities and doctors. 3. In the wake of the death of George Floyd President Trump signed an executive order on police reform. It calls for the creation of a database to track police officers with multiple instances of misconduct federal grants to encourage police departments to meet higher certification standards on use of force and the greater involvement of social workers and mental health professionals when the police respond to calls dealing with homelessness mental illness and addiction. The order also calls for police departments to ban the use of chokeholds except when an officer feels his or her life is endangered. Will this be enough to address concerns about police brutality? If not what other steps should be taken? These reforms are not enough. President Trump (and it occurred with President Obama also) proudly gave assault military equipment to police departments. Police departments have developed a culture of military presence with a siege mentality. This process has been many years in the making. Police departments should be defunded and then refunded. Police officers can reapply for their position. All new police officers will be required to train in non-violent processes. Military equipment must be returned to the federal government. Police officers must be licensed with a requirement of continuing education in order to maintain their license. Civilian police boards must be enacted with the power to review suspend and terminate officers. 4. Also in the wake of the death of George Floyd the House passed the Justice in Policing Act which would ban police departments from using chokeholds develop a national standard for use of force limit the transfer of military weapons to police departments define lynching as a federal hate crime establish a national police misconduct registry and limit qualified immunity which protects officers from lawsuits over alleged misconduct. Do you support this legislation? Why or why not? What other steps if any would you like to see the federal government take on police reform? I do support this legislation. Please see my prior response for what other steps are needed for reform. 5. Whats your view on President Trumps decision to commute the sentence of Roger Stone? There are many people in prison for long sentences for possessing a very small amount of marijuana. It is not right that those that commit white collar crimes are treated better than other citizens. The president needs to commute the sentences of many people who have committed small crimes. 6. Please tell us about your civic work in the last two years whether its legislation you have sponsored or other paid or volunteer work to improve your community. The last years I have had a private practice in psychotherapy. Many of my clients have an inability to pay due to immigration status and other reasons. I have treated a good number of people pro bono. In past years I have worked with the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless; helped establish a homeless center and worked with various community groups. I am also a founding member of the Alliance for Just Money. 7. What are your views on the decision by the U.S. House to impeach President Donald Trump? Was the impeachment process fair or not? How so? If in your view the president should not have been impeached would you have supported censure? Please explain. The Democrats attempted to impeach the President on false premises. Evidence used was not genuine. The Steele dossier was a made-up document. The process was an attempt to avoid addressing the flaws in the Democratic platform as well as the support of a flawed candidate in a corrupt primary process. There are many things the President may be criminally liable for but these were not investigated. I think mostly because many politicians of both major parties are guilty of similar offenses. The process of impeachment was a sham and removed our attention from the wars we are in the out of control military budget the climate crisis and much more. 8. How would you reduce the federal budget deficit which now stands at about $1 trillion for 2020? What changes if any to the U.S. tax code do you support and why?  Firstly the budget deficit this year will be $3-4 trillion. It is this deficit that is often used as the reason we cannot have good things like Medicare for All forgiveness of student debt and free education. The deficit exists because the country relies on private banks purchasing Treasury Bonds for its money supply. There are few banks that are qualified to do this so the process is in the hands of a small number of people. In buying Treasury Bonds banks fund the government. They buy the bonds with money made from thin air but expect the money to be repaid with interest. So we have debt. When the government cannot cover its costs through taxation they sell more bonds. This process was established by The Federal Reserve system in 1913. All banks must be part of it. As part of this act private banks can create money from nothing for other purposes such as mortgages and student loans. Banks create money only through the establishment of debt. This debt under the current system can never be paid back. It does not have to be this way. Article 1 section 8 clause 5 of the US Constitution gives the federal government the right to create money without debt. My proposal would be to eliminate the Federal Reserve and the right of banks to create money with debt and create a monetary authority under the Department of the Treasury. The authority would determine the amount of money needed in the economy to provide for the common welfare and common needs. The Treasury would establish this amount and it would be budgeted by Congress. This would be clean money without debt. What about the debt that exists? It would be paid back to the banks by the Treasury over a period of years. Probably around 100. Banks would have money for their reserves and to lend for new investments and business ventures Regarding the tax code: All should be paying their fair share. The wealthiest have the first access to created money the average citizen has the last access. The last pay the most and the first pay the least. We need to change that so that the first are last and the last are first. That would be a fair tax system. 9. What changes would you like to see made to our nations healthcare system? Would you shore up the Affordable Care Act or work to repeal it in full? Whats your view on Medicare for All? And what should be done if anything to bring down the cost of prescription drugs? This is so easy. Medicare at 100% for all is the least expensive and most fair way to fund a healthcare system. Look at the rest of the developed world. The government through Medicare for all would be able to negotiate the price of drugs but medications would be paid for by a Medicare for all program. 10. Do you support or oppose DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) and why? Should a path to citizenship be created for the so-called DREAMers? Please explain. This is just simple justice. Those who came here as children and have grown up here and contribute to society have a right to stay. Anything else would be inhuman. Of course they should be able to become citizens. 11. What are the three most important issues in your district on which the federal government can and should act? In terms of the Federal Government for this district and many districts UBI with fair tax system is needed Medicare for all and a just distribution of federal dollars for human needs in the district. 12.  What is the biggest difference between you and your opponent(s)? I really dont know where my Republican opponent stands on these issues. As far as my Democratic opponent and the incumbent well I would say look at his voting record. 13. What action should Congress take if any to reduce gun violence? Military grade weaponry needs to be illegal. Other guns must be registered and owning a gun most be licensed with a requirement of yearly continuing education on gun safety. Police should be as focused on illegal gun sales as they are on drug sales. 14. Is climate change real? Is it significantly man-made? Is it a threat to humankind? What if anything should Congress and the federal government do about it? The knowledge that burning fossil fuels creates climate change was researched and confirmed by the oil companies themselves in the 1950s 70 years ago. It is not a debate in the scientific community; only the business community wants there to be a debate. We already see the effects of climate change and it will get worse. What is needed is a Green New Deal. We need to get off fossil fuels reduce consumption of energy and create jobs to protect water forests and animals our ecosystem both micro and macro. 15. What should Congress do to ensure the solvency of Social Security and Medicare? During the Reagan administration the Social Security fund was used to balance the budget. This money was taken from Social Security to make an economic policy appear better. There have been raids on Social Security ever since. There is no crisis of Social Security. Social Security is not part of the budget so cutting it would not make a difference in the deficit. The effort to reduce Social Security is totally inhumane. Social Security will be solvent if the money owed to it is paid. I am for Medicare for all. 16. What should Congress do to address the student loan crisis? Would you use the word crisis? Student debt is a crisis. It puts many from the younger generations in the position of being indentured servants. They are not able to participate fully in the economy because so much of their income goes to debt payment. Student loans should be assumed by the Federal Government and added to the deficit that will be paid overtime when we have a just clean money system. Yes this is a crisis for those who are burdened with this debt but this is also a crisis for the economy as money that pays back debt is not money that goes into the development of the economy. 17. What should our nations relationship be with Russia? We should have fair and just relationships with all nations. We should not have a belligerent oppositional relationship with any country. It is not in the interests of the American people to have such relationships only the interests of the military industrial complex. 18. Whats your view on the use of tariffs in international commerce? Has President Trump imposed tariffs properly and effectively? Please explain. President Trump uses tariffs as punishments. The industrialists have been sending jobs to places without worker protection and in the case of China to foreign labor camps for awhile. Once there is a truly fair workplace in every country there would be little need for tariff protection. We should be ensuring that workers are treated fairly both here and everywhere else and that ecological protections are in place everywhere. Once we have accomplished this tariffs will take care of themselves. 19. Does the United States have a responsibility to promote democracy in other countries? Please explain. We need to have democracy in the United States first. We know that our intelligence agencies have been undermining democracy in the rest of the world. This is not in service of the American people but in the interests of big business. We should not send military anywhere with the excuse that we are doing it to protect democracy. We are in other countries to secure wealth for the richest. 20. What should Congress do to limit the proliferation of nuclear arms? Demand that the President negotiate a nuclear arms reduction treaty with all nuclear powers with the end goal of eliminating all nuclear arms. 21. Please list all relatives on public or campaign payrolls and their jobs on those payrolls. None 22. What historical figure from Illinois other than Abraham Lincoln (because everybodys big on Abe) do you most admire or draw inspiration from? Please explain. I was inspired by Paul Simons moral and principled stances on issues. 23. Whats your favorite TV streaming or web-based show of all time. Why? I do not watch much TV but 20 years ago my wife and I liked the X Files. The portrayal of the intersection of science and intuition was interesting.,political,Facebook
TO THE PROTESTERS:  An Open Letter About Concealed Carry in Texas.  I hope someone has explained to the newly protesting and those from out of state what Open Carry and Concealed Carry means in Texas and the SERIOUS AND GET YOU DEAD QUICK change in the law when the sun goes down in our little State.  Particularly the part that deadly force is allowed to prevent loss of PROPERTY as well as life after the sun goes down. Which when paired with our conspiracy and co-conspirator statute get you in jail for a long time for something you never planned on.  See if Righteous Protestor is engaged in the same activity as Property Destroyer. Like protesting....but Property Destroyer starts throwing bricks at a building Attempting to set it on fire looting or whateverAfter dark Owner has right to use deadly force to protect his property and if he accidentally hits and kills Righteous Protestor? Property Destroyer will be charged not Owner.  This goes double for Miss Protesting to be Cool....if that Cute Dude you are hanging with tries to break into a building and the owner shoots him?....everybody in the group can get charged with Cute Dudes death but not the Owner.  So be careful who you hang with after dark here in Texas.....and dont forget there are a lot of people who have open carry permits and A LOT more have concealed carry permits. Use your head or someone will most certainly blow it off. Im not exaggerating these people are crazy about their guns. Plus they spent a bunch of money getting the license to carry and theyre just itching for a reason to use it.  To that end If you are not from Texas and you dont understand the gun culture.......Please get back on the bus and go home right now because many simple silly things that you think are cute and you can get away with in other states......will get you dead here. Please read the Facebook and social media posts of others who have been protesting in Texas cities and BELIEVE THEM. Like I said please use your head or someone will gladly oblige you an education.  (P.S. Oh and face masks you CANT protest WITHOUT A MASK but you can NOT protest and NOT have to wear a mask. I know its confusing but keep in mind that if one protestor tests positive for the virus they are going to have to quarantine all yall. Plus if you are seen on TV protesting then everyone will know that youve been exposed and you are going to have to quarantine.....And remember the actual virus fell well below hopeful expectations so theyre more than happy to load exposed protesters in a bunch of 18 wheelers and ship you off to the quarantine yards but Dont worry there is plenty of room),political,Facebook

Providing Local Law Enforcement Agencies Greater Flexibility in Disposing of Firearms  As a result of meetings with local government officials I learned that many law enforcement agencies across our state wanted greater flexibility in disposing of guns or firearms which they confiscated or found. Apparently if a gun cannot be returned to its lawful owner then law enforcement agencies are forced to sell the weapons. Many agencies do not want to put these firearms back on the street. I recently learned from a City of Durham police officer that they confiscated over 800 weapons last year. I recently filed a bill Senate Bill 485 which if passed would allow cities or counties to adopt a local ordinance which would allow law enforcement agencies within their jurisdictions to destroy confiscated or found firearms which come into their possession rather than to sell them. The bill provides local governments the option of passing a local ordinance that provides their law enforcement agency this option. This bill has the support of the NC Chief of Police Association as well as other groups. Id like to thank Senator Danny Britt for serving as a primary co-sponsor on this bill.,political,Facebook

Conservative Reviews Daniel Horowitz presents a seven-step plan to reduce homicides. I have distilled his seven steps to six which are set forth below along with some of Horowitzs commentary:  Increase mandatory sentencing for gun felons: What if Republicans brought a bill to the Senate floor to increase mandatory sentencing on gun felons for those engaging in a violent crime with guns or those caught possessing guns after being convicted for aggravated felonies? There are so many stories of violent felons violating their probation by owning firearms yet they arent sent back to prison.  Increase mandatory sentencing for gun felons: Homicide in this country plummeted by over 60 percent precisely over the same period that gun ownership soared. Why? Thanks to Reagans Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) we actually deterred violent criminals with stiff mandatory sentencing. Yet for all the hand-wringing over draconian mandatory sentences they were only mandatory from 1987 to 2005. Following the Booker decision of the Supreme Court they have just been advisory. This has created a huge amount of disparity in the system and in recent years the lack of mandatory sentencing has decreased the successes of the Reagan-era laws. Take bad guys who use guns (or other weapons) off the streets not guns out of the hands of law-abiding citizens.  Fix court loophole allowing violent felons back on the streets: Four years ago in Johnson v. U.S the Supreme Court ruled that the crime of violence provision in the ACCA is unconstitutionally vague. That has allowed thousands of the worst career gun felons and other violent individuals to get out of jail early or escape reasonable sentencing to begin with. Just this year. . . Justice Gorsuch joined with the four liberals in expanding the assault on the ACCA this time by saying that 924(c)(3) the statute that prohibits using or carrying a firearm during a federal crime of violence is unconstitutional. . .It is simply astounding that the GOP-controlled Senate has not tried to fix this law especially in light of Democrats supporting gun control. Now armed robbers pointing short-barreled shotguns at store clerks avoid tougher sentencing at the same time liberals claim they want to do something! about gun violence.  Allow good guys to carry everywhere: While we seek to deter bad guys with guns why not allow peaceful citizens who undergo a background check and licensing to be able to carry in all 50 states with such a license just as with drivers licenses?. . .No state has the right to deny an unambiguous constitutional right and one of the reasons we have a federal government is to protect those rights when states infringe on them.  Fast-track death penalty for mass murderers: [I]t now takes over 20 years to execute someone essentially rendering capital punishment worthless as a deterrent. [W]hite supremacist attackers in particular dont seem to kill themselves as they attack which means they would be more deterred by a swift death penalty.  Declare war on sanctuary cities: The only thing worse than letting career criminals back on the streets is letting other countries career criminals remain in the country. . . Nearly every day at [Conservative Review] we cover the endless murders sex assaults and drunk driving incidents by illegal aliens who are allowed to remain in this country often after committing other crimes thanks to sanctuary cities. By definition these are the most avoidable deaths imaginable. If Democrats are demanding to do something! we should begin with getting rid of other countries criminals by immediately punishing sanctuary cities and by allowing citizens to sue sanctuary officials who release criminal aliens. Congress should also create a fund for victims of illegal aliens out of the money saved from denying grant programs to sanctuaries.,political,Facebook
"Lengthy but worth your time if you are willing to listen  RANDOM PSYCHOLOGY 75 RANDOM PSYCHOLOGY 75 I am a Gemini so I am supposed to have two different lives/ personalities. And I am perfectly okay with it. And if you know me well enough you know about both of me you have probably met both of me. But the same is true of the rest of us today Gemini or not. But only as far as having two lifes most of us only like to show just one side of ourselves we don't want the people to know the other half. What if all 400 of the people we been to bed with show up at our funeral and swap notes or give our spouses weird looks. Just Kidding folks! We complain about the behavior of others we fail to see ourselves in the actions or failures of others. We laugh at others while doing the same things the are doing living the same lives as they are. We are all selfish and greedy we are all lazy and want something for nothing we all think we are better than those ""others"". Look around the Corona virus has exposed our character as people and as a nation. We are just short of looting but that could come if things get worse. Both the left and the right have been on it all across the nation. We cannot say that it was the #liberals or the #conservatives #Republicans or the #Democrats that went on hoarding or over buying acting foolish. How is it that in a nation where half the people or more are either on assistance or living paycheck to paycheck the people bought more supplies and food than they could possibly use in months if not longer. But the bug of greed struck all of us and the common sense left the country. Why are people of the nation buying guns and ammo to protect themselves against the rest. How is it then that we blame the rich for looting the country. How can the rich blame the masses of being greedy when they are looking (and getting) hand outs from the government. How is everyone looking for something for nothing. Our government well represents us who we are if the president is a liar why are we surprised we are all liars basically if the rich want a handout we all have our hands out only that the average person doesn't have enough money to buy a politician to support his cause.

US Senate Refuses to Appropriate $50 Million to Study Gun Violence.  Today I read an article relating to Republicans in the US Senate in Washington omitting $50 million in funding for gun violence research allegedly because it was too controversial. The US House passed a budget in July that wouldve appropriated $25 million each to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and to the National Institute of Health to better understand and prevent injury and death as a result of firearm violence. It wouldve been the first funding designated for this purpose since the 1990s. Unfortunately the US Senate does not believe that this is needed or necessary according to Republican Senator Roy Blunt from Missouri. Its interesting that Blunts son former Missouri Governor Matt Blunt sits on the Board of the National Rifle Association. I guess that says it all.

The Gun Control Fallacy  Gun control to put it simply is impossible. It is impossible because it is not an attempt to control guns but is an attempt to control human behavior. Would it be possible to implement car or knife control? Human behavior dictates whether or not there will be a school shooting not laws. Laws can only provide for punish for the crime not prevent it. Do speed limit signs prevent speeding.  The looney Left never miss an opportunity to take advantage of the deaths of selected individuals school children in this case to advance a political agenda while using their favorite tools which in this case happens to be school children. The tactic of using and indoctrinating children is a mainstay of Liberal political philosophy. Just as it is with communists fascists socialists and nazis.  These cries from the Left and the ignorant children they have incorporated into their agenda are not about actually protecting the children. How do we know this? Its simple. When it is proposed to protect children while at school with armed personnel in some fashion Liberals are unalterably opposed to it. They make stupid emotional arguments such as that schools shouldnt be like armed fortresses or some such or that it will be emotionally traumatic to the children. These fallacious arguments are exhibit one that they couldnt care less about protecting the children but are more interested in restricting then reducing to be followed by eliminating gun ownership rights.  Dont think for one moment that just because the Constitution protects gun ownership that it is a right that cannot be taken away by usurpation. The Federal government has no Constitutional authority to make us buy anything but the Supreme Court said it does have the authority to make us buy health insurance. Obamacare is unconstitutional which means that this ruling by the Supreme Court was itself unconstitutional. The Constitution is merely a collection of words protected by the goodwill of men and dont count on that goodwill.  The only way to protect children at school is with armed personnel and those who can be armed at a moments notice a school militia of sorts how ironic. The banning of bump stocks age requirements and high capacity magazine restrictions will do absolutely nothing to protect children at the point of attack. There are ways to very easily overcome all of these useless laws in order to inflict as many casualties as possible. We live in a different world now. Disaffected former students and jilted boyfriends are not the only threat out there. No law can protect the school children from your run-of-the-mill terrorists. What then? Will Liberals squeal about terrorist control? Yes we must protect the children but it is clear we cant count on Liberals to cooperate in that endeavor.,political,Facebook
I've said it many times and I stand firm on it: GUN FREE ZONES are KILLING our kids. Wanna protect our kids? Let our teachers and faculty who ALREADY CARRY their LEGALLY owned guns OUTSIDE of school also carry their guns INSIDE their school. #PrayersForSantaClarita,political,Facebook
Dan Bishop's Republicans: The Party of Enormous Government  In case you needed another reason to vote for me in this election Dan Bishop and his Republican colleagues in the North Carolina General Assembly just made it clear again that theyll ignore your privacy your liberties and your livelihood. Bishop loves talking about freedom but by sponsoring Senate Bill 315 he controls what you can put in your body.  Bishops latest barrage on his constituents freedom deals with the non-psychoactive and non-addictive medicine known as CBD. Voters need to wake up to their new ballot options because Libertarians like me unlike Bishop and Republicans believe in personal freedom.  When it comes to guns Dan knows bans are futile saying The answer from the left to issues like that seem [sic] always be to restrict rights of law-abiding people which seems implausible ineffective and contrary to the sort of basic principles of liberty that our country is built around. Why does Dan think the situation would be any different with CBD?  National polling suggests more than 84% of the country supports the legalization of medical or recreational cannabis. North Carolina slumped far behind the rest of the country even in the face of widespread humanitarian support for medicinal use. After struggling under the Trump-Tariffs our agricultural industry began reaping the benefits of hemp.  Then Dan Bishop killed the buzz. Under the bill he sponsors the 1000 licensed hemp growers and 600 registered hemp processors in North Carolina alone will have to deal with new burdensome regulations. When red tape suits their needs Republicans like Bishop are thrilled to put their boot on our necks. He doesnt care that thousands of farmers sank billions of dollars into this explosive industry. Rather than championing North Carolinas opportunity to expand into the hemp industry Bishop wants to squash small businesses and hurt farmers.  Republicans are ramming this ban of CBD through the General Assembly as quickly as they can because they know it is wildly unpopular. By sponsoring this bill Bishop is not representing District 9 voters but is joining forces with the pharmaceutical industry the police and prison-industrial complex and the alcohol industry.  Dan a pro-war fearmonger wont resist the president when you and your loved ones are sent to their death in yet another needless war but he will resist the veterans when they return home. By barring veterans personal choice when it comes to managing their pain with CBD Dan dishonors their sacrifices their medical needs and their freedom. In light of the ever-growing opioid epidemic politicians like Bishop should be looking to expand options for our veterans not on stripping them away.  Dan Bishop and Republicans took this position because the police said they cant distinguish CBD from marijuana that contains THC. Rather than listen to clear a majority of the population that prefers marijuana legalization Bishop wants to further expand prohibition. Police take advantage of the system because the ambiguity gives them wide discretion. There are many examples of people who legally obtained CBD criminally charged for possessing marijuana. Some are charged with DUIs despite CBD containing nothing that gets you high.  Dan doesnt care about the new commercial ventures that free imaginative people can start. He doesnt care about your values and the initiative to make your life better. Instead he cares about legislating your morality and picking who wins and who loses in the market.  Remember the next time a Republican like Dan Bishop says I stand for small government there is nothing to back it up. From Bathroom Bills to CBD Bans Republicans think their morals and decision making abilities are superior to those of their constituents. Obey my morality or pay a $2500 fine.  This September you can vote for the only candidate that stands for limited government. Dont accept a Republican bullying you over your medical and economic needs. Make the sane choice not the same choice.  Jeff Scott for Congress,political,Facebook
A NEW YEAR BRINGS OLD CHALLENGES TO AN ARROGANT TWIN-ISLAND REPUBLIC (Part two of two); by Rock Hermon Hackshaw. Last month after I published part one of this column it drew some strange responses from a handful of puzzling (to me) readers. I must now deviate -a bit- from my original intent in order to clear up some misconceptions as to my motivation(s) and such. The phrase used to describe Trinidad as the most arrogant little island in the Caribbean Sea was coined by none other than Harry Belafonte- the internationally famous calypsonian/entertainer. I concur; and I offer no apologies. Look; the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago has a crime problem: a major one. This is no idle speculation but fait-accompli. This problem has been around for quite a while now and successive political regimes have failed to get a handle on it; far less solve it. In the last column I expressed that T&T is generally on the top-ten list of the most murderous countries (per capita) in the world and that this phenomenon has been somewhat of a recurring decimal since the new millennium began. The fact that even now -years into this crisis- there are Trinbagonians still in relative denial only strengthens my point as to the arrogance of too many citizens. If there was one message I had hoped readers would extrapolate from part one of this column it was this: I strongly believe the time has come for a unified approach to the nations crime problem from the total citizenry. Here is what I mean: It is time to transcend racial issues put aside ideological differences suspend personal invectives and delay political competitivity in order to collectively tackle crime in a civic way. It should be made the top national priority item of the day. Higher on the totem pole than even environmental/ecological challenges. Higher than economic concerns even. I intend to write another column on this issue soon enough wherein I will try to offer some concrete suggestions as to a way forward. Some readers have privately asked me to expound on the genesis of this crime wave; so let me facilitate them. Research shows that the larger island (Trinidad) has a reputation -going way back to the seventeenth century- of being a magnet for many of societys undesirables misfits vagabonds and outcasts. The island also had a reputation for having a high population of mixed-race residents: a general description which included those of differing ethnicities nationalities and creeds. This is a phenomenon that can be observed even today. As colonial possessions of Spain both islands were quietly ignored by their colonial master. There werent lots of agricultural products heading to Madrid from either Port of Spain or Scarboroughs ports. There wasnt any gold or silver to speak about far less ship out. And at that point in time neither the natural asphalt from La Breas wonder of the world pitch-lake nor the black gold (oil) seeping out of the ground in many other southern areas of Trinidad were considered economic assets. Sure there was farming and other agricultural activities taking place; but not on the same scale as most other Caribbean islands. Consider that by the time Emancipation ended in 1838 the island of Jamaica -only two and a half times larger in size- had more than twenty times a higher slave population than Trinidad and Tobago. Its one of the reasons why more indentured laborers from India ended up in Trinidad when compared to other islands. Research has also shown that during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries there were more residents of here speaking French (as their main language) rather than Spanish. This occurred even though Spain always controlled administration of both islands with a governorship based in Trinidad. One fateful day in 1797 Ralph Abercromby a Scottish-born admiral of the British navy pulled into Chaguramas Bay on the north-western side of Trinidad. He had one large warship and had essentially gone rogue from his chain of command. He dropped anchor and sent an envoy to the Spanish Governor (named Chacon) who resided in a north-eastern town called Saint Joseph: the capital then. The envoys message was in fact a complete bluff. He informed Chacon that a fleet of many more British warships would be arriving soon enough with the objective of razing the island and imposing British rule. Chacon was told that the only guarantee of safe evacuation for he and his people could be fulfilled there and then: were they to immediately evacuate. The envoy further posited that it would be futile to mount a defense since the island was relatively unfortified with a mere sprinkling of canons situated in some rather questionable defensive-positions. Chacon and his peeps were out of there in no time flat; and Trinidad was conquered without a single shot being fired. This started British rule as accepted by historians. There is a footnote which can also be added to this. Research also shows that there were other attempts to wrest Trinidad and Tobago from Spain. It is written that French British and Dutch adventurers tried -but failed- on many occasions prior to Abercrombys successful bluff. Thus just like today temptation(s) ran amok even then. In 1802 the Treaty of Amiens deemed Trinidad a British colony; and ceded the Brits the island of Tobago also. To me this was an oddity since amongst the warring European powers sitting around that bargaining table neither the Dutch French Russians or others (beyond Britain) had any legitimate claim(s) to these two islands. The competing European powers simply screwed Spain which at that point in time was recognized as the worlds number one super-power. Interestingly enough the treaty only lasted about 15 months; but from there on in Britain had uninterrupted rule over both islands. Scholars note that in 1889 the islands were officially conjoined; and that on August 31st 1962 they were granted independence from Britain; while remaining members of the larger British Commonwealth of nations. Eighteen days later they became members of the United Nations and in 1967 they joined the Organization of American States (OAS). In August of 1976 T&T became a Republic. Many academics trace the beginnings of lawlessness in T&T and other Third-World countries all the way back to the end of World War 2. They also cite (and link) the various movements for independence in the numerous colonies. The claim is that the political retreat(s) of European colonial masters left power-vacuums which created political tensions amongst classes religions races tribes and ethnicities. In many instances this has led to violence and lawlessness. In the nineteen-sixties and seventies the civil rights struggle of black-Americans in the USA (United States of Amnesia) and the parallel rise of various individual black-power political movements captured the imagination(s) of many in the African diaspora. Understandably and predictably there were social economic and political upheavals (some violent) all around the globe. Trinidad and Tobago had its share of political unrest back in the nineteen-seventies. There were lots of vocal demonstrations spontaneous black-power marches thunderous anti-government protests and sporadic labor-unrest. There were those who harbored ideas of overthrowing the democratically elected government while others simply tried to make political mileage out of the chaos. Large caches of guns and other ammunition were found all over the larger island. States of Emergency were regularly imposed by the authorities. Law-enforcement and military-personnel were given abnormal powers. Curfews and basic-martial-law were imposed from time to time and the populace in general suffered through the overall tension wherein dissidents were routinely imprisoned and brutalized. Objectively speaking there were relatively few attendant mortalities but it was chaotic nonetheless. Law-enforcement and security forces were taxed in unprecedented ways; and in retrospect things could have been much worse; but it was still a terrible and a sordid chapter in the history of T&T. There is no doubt in my mind that the twin-islands of Trinidad and Tobago lost their innocence during the nineteen-seventies. And as the saying goes: innocence is like virginity; once lost it is never ever regained. It is very possible that as a country we may one day return to the stress-less simplicity of T&T-life of yesteryear(s); but our innocence is gone; and profoundly missed nowadays. The slow descent into the crime-abyss started somewhere in this decade (70s) and slowly worsened in subsequent decades. When we got to the nineteen-nineties a double-whammy was unleashed via two bills passed in the US Congress. They were signed into law by then president Bill Clinton. In my estimation this was the coup de grace relative to the crime-surge experienced by Caribbean and Latin American nations since the new millennium. During the nineteen-eighties the USA experienced an explosion in the usage of an illegal drug known as crack. It was a derivative from the drug cocaine. This explosion led to an epidemic which in turn fueled a crime-wave. The murder-rate skyrocketed mainly because of the attendant violence and ancillary crimes. The main governmental response in the USA -at all three levels- was to pass harsh laws against illegal drug-usage and to stiffen sentences for those involved in the drug-trade and other linked crimes. Legislation like the three strike rule emerged. An individual who committed three felonies could encounter a lengthy prison term (punishment included life-sentences even). Social upheavals and specific socio-cultural trends can be traced right back to these policy-shifts. In 1994 President Bill Clinton signed a Crime Bill which was really an immigration-reform bill in disguise. Immigrants were faced with deportation for committing some of the most rudimentary of misdemeanors. These deportations -in turn- impacted home-countries to no end. Then in 1996 President Clinton signed an anti-terrorism bill which was (again) another immigration-reform bill in disguise. What many people missed was the main objective behind both bills: to have better control on the influx of non-whites to the USA. Back in the early nineteen-seventies right-wing think-tanks (mainly comprised of Caucasian males) were projecting that by the year 2020 one out of every two American babies born would be non-white. They were concerned that demographic shifts will lead to a county wherein the white population will eventually be subsumed by a non-white majority. Amongst the factors cited were immigration patterns birth-control practices by whites laisse-faire abortion policies in most states and a higher birth rate amongst Hispanic migrants -arriving in droves- from Latin America. Back then the illegal-alien problem on the southern borders was arguably ten times worse than it is today. These two bills which Bill Clinton signed were in reality conservative political responses to demographic shifts: worrisome to the white-supremacists and their ideals. The aim was to stem the flow of non-whites into the USA. However there were unanticipated consequences which impacted many countries outside North America. Mass deportation measures had a visible effect on crime in the countries where most deportees were shipped. The Caribbean islands were not spared. The one country in the Western Hemisphere that ostensibly prepared for the socio-politico-economic-cultural impact of returnees was Argentina. Government policy in that country dealt with absorbing and reacclimating those who had very few links to a country they had left many many years before. Job-training programs housing health-care (including mental-health/counselling) employment opportunities and the like were features of this policy. As such the crime wave experienced by most other countries essentially evaded Argentinians. Consider Argentinas approach to this problem with the non-approach of the previous T&T government. A few years ago T&Ts prime minister then (Ms. Kamla Persad-Bissessar) addressed a Brooklyn audience primarily made up of folks born on the twin-islands. When questioned as to her plans for dealing with deportees from the USA she retorted (to the questioner): why are you so concerned about them? She impetuously implied that the questioner should be more concerned with those who had been there throughout. It was an answer lacking both depth and compassion and it was a display of the type of T&T arrogance of which I speak. A look at crime stats since 1994 -in most countries situated in the Western Hemisphere- shows the clear co-relation(s) between (1) these two aforementioned bills President Clinton signed into law;(2) a significant uptick in deportations from the USA and (3) a rise in crime in the countries most impacted by these deportations. In my last column I gave about 25 consecutive years of T&T murder stats and also sprinkled some kidnapping numbers within. During the past decade T&T has had a low solve-rate relative to murders. In fact my research showed that only Peru appeared to have had a lower solve-rate. By solve rate I mean the entire law-enforcement process: from a specific criminal act of murder to the investigation to an arrest to a trial and then conviction/punishment. In Peru the solve rate has gotten to as low as ten per cent. In T&T that number has been stuck in the teens for some time now. This means that there are lots of people walking around who have apparently gotten away with murder. This is a daunting revelation for two islands as small as these. Over the last quarter-century the T&T republic has experienced way over five thousand murders. My research has been unable to detail even one thousand murder convictions during this period. I challenge my detractors to disprove this. As far as I can ascertain there is a backlog of pending murder cases on the criminal-docket. Therein lies another problem which I pointed out in my first column: In T&T much needed change moves along at molasses pace. The social economic political and cultural effects of repatriating lawbreakers to unwelcoming shores isnt the main reason why crime has exploded in T&T. Truth be told the main factor fueling the crime surge is the lucrative albeit illegal-drug-trade. T&Ts proximity to Columbia and other Latin American countries -which are the main suppliers of illegal drugs to Europe and North America- has created an environment wherein involvement in the drug business has been irresistible to far too many corrupt weaklings. Before we can begin to solve this crime-problem T&T citizens need to do some honest in-depth introspection. Over recent years European and Asian countries have issued advisories and warnings to their citizens travelling to Trinidad and Tobago; all because of the crime situation. Canada and the USA have also issued similar communiques from time to time. These columns I now write are meant to edify and inform. They are not meant to disrespect T&T citizens and expatriates. They are not meant to ridicule anyone. Trinidad is a special place for me but I will always tell it like it is. I will write it or say it as I see fit; then I will duck and take cover from the incoming fire. I truly question the intelligence and honesty of those who critiqued my first column on this topic. A new year has indeed brought old challenges to an arrogant twin-island republic. Stay tuned-in folks. I will do one more column on this topic next month. *********************************************************************************,political,Facebook
How many times must a man tell you he cant breathe before you believe him?  How many gasps for air are needed to stir your conscience?  How unresponsive must be that man before you finally lift your knee off the back of his neck?  Anyone who knows me know I'm a staunch supporter of law enforcement...BUT... how many more times must we go through this?  Specifically how long will black people especially black men be targeted abused and killed by rogues with badges and rogues without badges who feel no less entitled taking the law into their hands?  Now not all law enforcement officials are infected by this virus of malice and contempt but enough is enough! First it was the young man down in Brunswick now it's the guy up in Minneapolis.  These ongoing unjustified killings of black males females by police officers only heighten black peoples fears and deepen their mistrust of authorities with guns and badges even as the encounters tarnish the honor of decent officers and police departments everywhere.,political,Facebook
Huge thanks to the over 1000 neighbors who showed up at events across the district to literally endorse this campaign. Thank you! I look forward with your help to winning this district back and serving and representing you once more!   On Tuesday March 10th at noon the Taylor for Congress 2020 committee filed for Scott Taylor to appear on the ballot as candidate for Virginias Second Congressional District. This filing applies for ballot access for the Republican Primary on June 9th 2020.  The campaign has received the endorsements of GOP leaders and local citizens alike. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy named Scott Taylor to the Young Guns program identifying Taylor as representing the conservative values and being the most competitive candidate to win back the district for Republicans. Scott Taylors supporters have come out in force to numerous events hosted throughout the 2nd District. The grassroots support for Taylor to win the Republican Primary and General Elections is evidenced by the momentum in the local community complemented by national-level GOP attention. Well over 1000 voters from all over the district showed up to sign and put Taylor back on the ballot.  Taylor commented I am humbled and fired up by the support of our community. My passion for the prosperity and welfare of my constituency is exactly why I am back in this race. The endorsement and support of experienced senior leaders of the GOP demonstrates our ability to execute a win  in June and November. Now that were officially on the ballot the work of sharing our positive message far and wide continues to ramp up.,political,Facebook
MESSAGE TO HATERS OF TRENDING LEFT AND RACISTS EVERYWHERE: (wouldn't load correctly on the website thus posting it here please read top to bottom and give me your feedback in the comments. I really appreciate it -B)  Get Over Yourself  If you say or do something that is objectively racist sexist stupid causes harm panic chaos or just simply makes people cringe with a sick feeling inside their stomach for no good reason because it came from your immoral belief system being empowered by Trump being President people like me are going to call you on it. I will call you a racist when you are one and there VERY few gray areas when it comes to if something is racist or not.  Stop being a crybaby when someone of a different color says something about you being white that would be racist if it were any other race because until it is no longer dangerous simply to be a black man walking ANYWHERE in public white people like me and you just have to deal with it. None of us are perfect and none of us are immune to being hurt by words but when it comes to reverse racism claims by white people nothing is more petty and pathetic.  This is the Trump era now. All norms are out the window and nobody is getting any extra credit for playing nice in 2019.  When some of you on the right realize you dont have a fact-based case against a progressive policy agenda some of you try to paint me as a lowlife who has nothing going for him. You people (yes I said you people) need to realize that when you flip to personal attack mode you yourself become lower than a lowlife youre buried in a grave of your own making .  You Can Try to Hurt Me But Youll Fail The only reason you even have an opportunity to personally attack me is because I am open about who I am flaws included. Before creating this blog Trending Left and taking it seriously I truly hated myself. I hated how scared I had become of letting anyone see me because before I had two painful accidents and had the love of my life leave me via text never to be heard from again I use to be a pretty awesome guy. I use to be physically in shape I had a good paying job and I had at least 1 or 2 true legit best friends at any given time. When I lost all of that because of reasons both in and out of my control I thought my life was over and there was no point in even trying anymore. But then Trump got elected and Trump didnt grow into the role as President he started empowering things like white supremacy sexism and insanely racist rhetoric towards Central American immigrants.  I know that Fox News has a team dedicated to following every single murder that happens in this country and immediately asking the police if an immigrant from Central America was the killer. This is because Fox News and the Trump Republican Party know when it comes to insane domestic terrorists and murderers racist white people are BY FAR the biggest threat to innocent non-white American citizens (and thats not even counting racist white police officers killing unarmed black and brown people). Illegal immigrants from Central America DO INDEED commit heinous crimes on American citizens including murder. But as is almost always the case the crimes committed at worst leave 1-2 innocent people dead and you only hear about the story because of Fox Newss desperate need for updated propaganda material.  This is the part where the uneducated #MAGA region of Twitter starts losing it because to them they believe all black and brown immigrants are out to murder kidnap and rape them. Its classic fear-mongering at work. Im sorry to the victims families and friends of those who have had their lives taken by one of the relatively handful of evil illegal immigrants that actually commit violent crimes in the U.S.. But progressives and enlightened people would rather we figure out how to stop troubled American white men from becoming so radically violent they decided to murder innocent lives by the dozens. We arent so ignorant to think that mass shootings wont continue happening in this country that loves its guns but it is also insanely ignorant to believe that there is nothing we can do to help prevent guns from getting to the wrong people guns that cannot fire off 100 bullets in less than a minute or faster and its ignorant to think that we cant do more about mental health issues so that these kind of things never cross the minds of potential shooters.  White Republicans and Trump supporters DO NOT CARE that almost all mass shootings both in the United States and now of course abroad in New Zealand are carried out by racist troubled white men. Within the past few years there have now been at least five mass shootings and/or bombings carried out or barely prevented from being executed done in the name of white supremacy. They have cited Trump as someone who empowers them to release their inner-Hitler in their manifestos and some have literally said they murdered innocent lives in order to start a race war or second civil war. When you hear people on the right talk about how America today is heading for a second civil war its most likely because thats basically what the white supremacists in America want to happen. Dont be fooled by that. Hispanic Are The BEST!  Based on my experience working with as a 15-17-year-old manual laborer and as a boyfriend to two first generation Latinas I saw first hand families who literally worked incredibly hard for everything they had and made me feel like part of a real family in both of my long-term relationships Ive been lucky to have. I have been truly sickened by Trumps actions and behavior towards these people.  Because of Donald Trump I as a straight white man in America have to hope people especially Hispanics who are a different color and background than me give me a chance to show them who I am before they judge me but I cant blame them for wanting nothing to do with me based on my appearance. This is all because of President Trump. My generation of white people already knew we have certain privileges that others dont have and that it isnt fair but at least before Trump I felt like other races of the same generation inherently knew that from our generation on things would slowly but surely get better and more fair. That feeling is gone and will never return now because of Trump.  At Least I Try At Least Care  Im not perfect I have issues I am even very open about my severe depression and suicidal thoughts and even how Ive attempted suicide twice in the past year 1/2 but thats because Im trying to get better at life. Im trying to do something that matters with Trending Left which is to simply get a few more people to vote in 2020 especially in Southern California where we need to keep the districts blue. When you learn that Hillary lost the 2016 election in a place like Wisconsin by 1-2 votes per precinct its pretty easy to realize that getting a few more family members and friends to vote in 2020 is a worthwhile endeavor.

Big win in Federal Court! Our client Nancy Smith is a wheelchair user who went to see Guns N' Roses at the Superdome. She bought conventional tickets on the floor and when she got to her seats the usher told her she had to transfer out of her wheelchair and into the folding chair AND THEY TOOK AWAY HER WHEELCHAIR! We sued the State of Louisiana (owners of the Superdome) and they maintained they did nothing wrong. Incredible right?!?! So we took them to trial and our client was awarded $20000 + attorney's fees (so she pockets ALL the $20000) -AND- the Superdome has to change its policies and procedures and training moving forward!

Friends---There are five important bills dealing with guns that pending in the State Legislature. These bills will be taken up when the Legislature reconvenes on 8/12.  Sponsored by Brady California these are *must pass* bills. Each represents an important change that WE CAN MAKE NOW even as we work to change Congress:  Senate Bill 61 by Senator  reduces the number of guns by prohibiting anyone from purchasing more than one long gun per month and prohibiting selling semiautomatic rifles to any person under 21.    Assembly Bill 61 authored by Assemblyman  will expand California's Gun Violence Restraining Order law--which currently allows family members spouses and domestic partners to request a protective order--to include employers coworkers and school faculty members.    Assembly Bill 165 by  will increase training for police on Gun Violence Restraining Orders including how and when to help victims file.    Assembly Bill 339 by Assemblywoman  will create a 'statewide template' for administering the Gun Violence Restraining Orders ensuring that even smaller towns adopt their use.    Assembly Bill 340 also authored by Assemblywoman  will increase funding to remove guns from people listed in the California Dept of Justice's Armed Prohibited Persons System. The bill will create a pilot program to increase the ability of local police departments to work with the DOJ to resolve CA's backlog of cases of cases where 'prohibited persons' still own firearms.

A response to the silence of someone I interact with online: You probably won't see me commenting on any of your posts after this. I've just become disgusted by the quality of human being that tends to interact with what you share. Protest is embedded in every facet of the history of this nation since it's birth. We have people justifying homicide and or assault with a deadly weapon to their being delayed or threatened by the presence of people near their vehicle. It's disgusting and yet you regularly stir the pot get mad at someone for using a naughty word but say nothing to these disgusting individuals justifying homicide. Little to nothing was said by these same folks about people marching all over the nation carrying guns. No remote sympathy for the fact that black people are killed by police at twice the rate of Caucasians. Most of them I can just imagine their actions if they were alive in the 50s and 60's and old enough to go out to help drag blacks away from counters or cheer on police turning hoses on protesters in the streets. For people that would claim to be Christians they display zero empathy for their fellow man and encourage violence. Yet you say nothing... If only people gave a damn about other human beings as much as they care about property we might truly be a nation worthy of our ideals. I'd rather be surrounded by those protesters risking exposure to COVID then socialize with the vast majority of people that you seem to engage with. I will say I appreciated your community leadership with regard to the pandemic and choosing to keep your business operating within safe measures. I appreciate that usually we are able to discuss things in a civil manner. However your silence with regard to these people in your comments and ongoing desire to feed a negative narrative of peoples actions while protesting while saying little or nothing about what they are fighting for says just as much. I've put my own safety and security on the line alongside law enforcement for close to 15 years in various ways. I love the vast majority of cops and wish them well and safety every day they go to work. This movement is about systemic issues and people's lives whereas The Boston Tea Party was about taxes. I can only imagine where our nation would be if revolution against the crown or a dictator would be with today's citizenry and social media mixed in. Some of ya'll would be wearing British Uniforms though if this was 1776 and sadly you don't even realize it.,political,Facebook
New to the page? Need to know where I stand on some of the issues?   Abortion - the mothers right to choose ends at the babies right to life. You skipped plan A (keep ya legs closed) you skipped plan A.25 (use protection) then you conveniently skipped plan B. You've run out of choice and plan's lady.  2nd Amendment - Pick a gun. Any gun. That's your gun now. Red flag laws? Unconstitutional. I'll fight those and bans on anything to do with guns tooth and nail.  Illegal Aliens - Finish the wall then deport them ALL. No more legislation. The best nation on Earth should NOT be easy to come to. Fight to make your own nation better.  Healthcare - Send the entire issue to the states. Do away with HHS.  Education - Send the entire issue to the states. Do away with DOE.  Military - Ensure that our military comes second to none.  Spending - Just cut it. Many agencies and departments look ripe. REAL ripe for the pickings.  Debt - Stop borrowing. If we can't afford it we can't afford it. We've survived over 200 years without it we can go a couple hundred more without it. No more raising the debt ceiling.  Economy - Ensure that the economic climate is such that jobs may be maintained competition is plenty and wages are rising.  Welfare - drug test screening time limits (if you are not elderly or disabled) no unhealthy food/drinks using food stamps. But eventually sending this too back to the states.  Foreign Assistance - If nations that are our allies need help and we can help we should. But it should not always be guaranteed. And no nation hostile to us or our values have a hope of getting a dime from us.  War - While we don't seek them we will protect ourselves and our interest. With one objective... Neutralizing the threat. No nation building.  Immigration - Come one come all but don't show up here asking what we can do for you. Ask yourself what you can do for us. We will not make our immigration laws 'easier'. It defeats the purpose. May as well not have any.  Trade - Tariff free trade is the only way to real and lasting trade.  Did I make it Plain enough?

God Bless America - Charlie's Soapbox 2/7/2020  The phrase God Bless America is the title of one of the most durable songs in our history and is a part of the lyrics in an unknown number of compositions by American composers in all genres of music.  It is used as the closing remarks by public speakers of all stripes including presidents and lesser politicians.  It is one of the most frequently used complementary closes on personal letters spoken from pulpits openings of sports events and a part of the prayers of millions.  The point is God has blessed America and in my opinion more so than any nation in modern times.  This land bordered by the worlds two major oceans is a microcosm of practically every blessing God has granted to any other nation on earth.  We have the mountains the rivers lakes and forests plains and deserts metropolises and village cold regions hot regions temperature regions fertile agricultural areas swamps thousands of miles of seacoast and the most diverse population on earth.  Rich heritage and culture carried over from countries of origin from the colorful French flavored language and freewheeling lifestyle of the South Louisiana Cajuns to the Midwestern enclaves of the Scandinavians who settled Minnesota and Wisconsin. Little Italy China Town Cherokee Hamtramck where the colorful culture of the ethnic groups who settled there is still observed with festivals and fairs and the food drink and accents still reflect the flavor of the old country.  Beneath our soil and under our oceans there are vast deposits of gold silver copper minerals and diverse chemicals with petroleum reserves to last a century.  America leads the world in so many technological and industrial categories medicine space exploration food production and transportation with a standing army that is second to none the envy of the planet.  Land of the free home of the brave the American Dream the American way the land that has welcomed pilgrims from around the world for over two hundred years.  Yes God has blessed America but greed and lust for power threaten to do something the most formidable military powers and the most contagious political philosophies have not been able to do.  To take down the USA or to change it into a vast pasture full of sheep who have given over control of their lives to a godless totalitarian central government which makes cradle to grave decisions for every man woman and child. A one size fits all bureaucratic nightmare that would dictate every facet of life from who does and who does not get perks and benefits to the number of children each family is allowed to have.  You see this is all about globalism or one-world government and as long as there is a nation that claims to be exceptional and refuses to surrender its sovereignty values the rights of the individual and proclaims its independence to the point of fighting for it there can never be a one-world government.  And since the USA is the most powerful nation on earth as long as we cling to our God and our guns - pun intended - it just aint gonna happen.  So how do you handle an intractable conundrum like America?  Well you do it in increments.  First and foremost you find a way of proselytizing the most vulnerable among us the children.  You form huge influential political organizations like the National Education Association identify some powerful politicians who think their re-election is more important than what our children are being taught make sure their campaign coffers are never empty and proceed to tailor the curriculum to nudge the students in the direction you want them to go.  Then you fill the institutions of higher learning with Marxist professors who subtly convince their young charges that America is not really what it claims to be that it has stolen everything it has and has marginalized and depressed minorities and that its time for America to be cut down to size and the way to do that is to level the playing field to take away from those who have accumulated some degree of wealth by stealing it from those poor unfortunate souls who never had a chance under this unfair form of governance.  Its called socialism and it means that everybody no matter your skills education race creed or work ethic will have the same opportunities with free college free healthcare free childcare a shorter workweek guaranteed lifetime salary and lucrative retirement benefits.  There will also be realignments in the climate change policy we will eliminate fossil fuels and begin a program to convert to all renewable energy sources.  And it will all be paid for by the greedy rich.  Now lets get back to reality  Well first of all if every cent Jeff Bezos Bill Gates Warren Buffet and all the other multi-billionaires was not only taxed but confiscated it would not keep this socialist Shangri-La afloat for six months.  So then after all the rich have been taxed a VAT of 20% added and the government is in debt to the tune of four hundred trillion dollars or so no more credit is available and the American dollar is worth a little less than a dried corn shuck prices of food have gone through the roof and that nasty old gasoline the government promised to get rid of is selling for twenty-five dollars a gallon when you can find it.  And when you find out that tomorrow the government is sending people to put you and your family out in the street because you cant pay the seven hundred thousand dollars you owe on your house and the factory you worked for moved to Guatemala two years ago and your unemployment check has shrunk to two hundred dollars a month and you cant find another job what do you do.  And you think Ill get my guns out and  No you wont because the government which is moving to Brussels confiscated your guns five years ago.  Get the drift? the ship has sailed and youre not on it but dont feel bad because nobody else is on it either except for the people who talked you into this mess to start with and theyre on top of the world penthouses private jets the whole enchilada.  Okay maybe theres a tad of hyperbole and a grain of exaggeration in my prattle but the rock-solid fact remains...  SOCIALISM DOES NOT WORK!  IT NEVER HAS IT NEVER WILL!  Not Karl Marxs version not Fidel Castros version not Bernie Sanders version not the insane version Alexandria Cookie Ocasio-Cortez is pushing not Elizabeth Warrens Pollyanna ramblings that will probably include free pedicures before its over nobody no how no way has ever been successful at socialism.  Check the casualty list.  Start with Venezuela.  What do you think?  Pray for our troops our police and the peace of Jerusalem.  God Bless America  Charlie Daniels,political,Facebook

The GOP has convinced their base that the liberals want to:  1. Kill babies. 2. Give their jobs away. 3. Take their guns away. 4. Change their traditions. 5. Tax them more. 6. Limit their freedom.  Even though the GOP themselves have contributed to most of these their base blames liberals.  If we ever are going to convince this part of the country that liberal ideas are the best for the country we have to stop helping the GOP by creating extreme liberal policies without reaching out to this part of the country and listening to their fear and addressing it.

Is destroying America a winning electoral strategy?  A few years ago I was listening to a gun hating nut being questioned about his hatred of guns. He was posed with a scenario in which his home was invaded by a person who intended terrible harm to him and his family therefore would he not want a gun available in order to protect his wife and children from all manner of harm. I will never forget his response. He said that he would hide in the closet and call the police. It was then added to the scenario that the police would not arrive in time to save his family. As unbelievable as it was he continued to assert that he would hide in the closet and call the police and re-iterated his opposition to guns under any circumstance. The most basic duty of a father and husband is to protect his family with his life if need be yet he was willing to see everyone he loves destroyed before he would violate the rules of his ideology.  I think this story is important because it helps to provide perspective of leftist ideology in general and how that applies to what is happening in America today. This man no doubt loves his family dearly but the destruction of his family is far less worrisome for him than violating his ideology. If a man who loves his family dearly is willing to see his family destroyed in order to promote his ideology what do you think those who hate this country are willing to do to it in order to promote their ideology? Yes they too are willing to destroy it.  For leftist democrats which really means the entire democrat party because it has been taken over by the loons nothing is more important than their ideology and they are determined and always motivated to achieve power over everyone else. Their political philosophy has been described as a secular religion but it really isnt that. To describe it as a religion is an insult to religions. Theirs is a cult. A cult complete with the mindless chants of the Moonies and the destructive nature of Kool-Aid drinking zombies. They literally have taken to the destruction of every American institution that has made it the greatest country to have ever existed the most beloved most sought after for the hope of a better future and the most depended on to ensure a world free of world domination.  They are trying to create as much havoc as possible in all areas of life because they believe that President Trump will be blamed for it causing him to lose his bid for re-election so that they can usher in their leftist agenda which itself will make complete the destruction they have started. They have embraced the rioting looting and destruction of private and public property. They have embraced the violence that has resulted not only in bodily injury but also many deaths to law abiding citizens and law enforcement officers. They seek to drastically reduce the size of police departments or eliminate them entirely. They have been releasing violent criminals back onto the streets with no regard for the safety of law abiding citizens and some of these animals immediately upon having been released went right out and committed rapes and murders.  They are trying to destroy the economy using Covid 19 as an excuse. Typically the President in office receives the blame for a bad economy so they are trying at every turn to keep Americans locked down and businesses closed to the greatest degree possible. They have trampled civil rights closed businesses for so long that some will never reopen. The science is clear Covid 19 is particularly harmful to the very elderly and those in poor health. It is particularly harmless to all other especially children. But the science be damned they have an economy to destroy.  The democrats are trying to destroy our electoral system by doing away with our borders so that anyone can get in who wants in so that they can then be put on welfare and the voter rolls. They want to do away with the Electoral College which was created to make sure that every State mattered in national elections. They want to do a wholesale vote by mail scheme which will ensure voter fraud because ballots will be and have been mailed to the dead and to those still living who no longer live at the address on record. And no absentee voting isnt the same thing as the scheme the democrats want to put in place. Absentee ballots must be requested. Democrats want to send ballots out to every person registered to vote knowing that probably every precinct in this country has well over 100% of actual eligible voters on the voter rolls. If the election is close one crooked precinct or and handful of illegal votes can throw the entire election. Remember the 2000 presidential election? All of the things they want to do lay bare their fake concern about election integrity and voter rights.  They want to destroy the courts by expanding them with leftist judges who will decide cases properly..the left wing way. The courts are probably the most important target of leftists because they know their looney ideas will never come to fruition if it is up to the American people to decide so the courts staffed with leftist judges will be used to force their leftist agenda onto the American people.  They want to destroy Americanism and replace it with tribalism in order to keep Americans at each others throats particularly blacks and whites. Their obsession with skin color ethnicity and religion mirrors that of the KKK. Listening to their commentary that is laden with such references is full frontal evidence of their bigotry and racism.  They wish to do away with the so-called nuclear family a mother a father and children which is the most important institution known to mankind. The one thing that has caused the greatest harm to black families is the absence of fathers yet here is blm advocating for that very thing which is just another example of how black lives dont matter to blm.  This is just a partial list and are just the beginning for the totalitarian left. Make no mistake about it. It is their goal to ruin America for some grander scheme they want to put in place. Worldwide every one of these attempts to create a fair and just society by taking away freedom and personal property rights have failed completely. What makes these leftists so dangerous is their belief of their own superiority over all others just like the KKK. They are brainwashed brain-dead lunatics free of reason and logic who care about nothing and nobody except their ideology the ideology they want to force onto you. Government takeovers are always done by a very small minority of motivated actors who then gain control of the reins of power. There is a largely silent majority who must stop being silent.

What is an RPO and how much of an impact can it have on you and your 2nd Amendment Rights?  An RPO is essentially a court order that requires an individual to surrender all firearms and ammunition to a law enforcement agency for a period of 12 months if it has been found by a court that the individual poses a significant danger of causing personal injury to himself or herself or others by having in his or her custody or control or by purchasing possessing or receiving a firearm or any ammunition (790.401). Additionally if the respondent holds a license to carry a concealed weapon that license must be surrendered to law enforcement for the duration of the RPO. Violation of an RPO is a felony.  In my opinion one of the best ways in which to prevent yourself from being involved as the subject of an RPO if via education.  These orders are being used more and more to take guns away and it does not affect criminals on the street that obtain them illegally.  Education is the most effective way in which to protect yourself until the legislature can adjust this action.  I found out about a case the other day where someone did exactly what I teach not to do resulting in them loosing more than 100 of their firearms as a collector of various types of firearms.  They did exactly what I teach NOT TO DO in my courses and NO they never took my course.

GUNS! Ive been chatting with many people in Augusta and gun rights have come up several times. Ive also received a pile of surveys from groups both for and against gun control most with misleading and unanswerable questions. Here is where I stand on guns. I am a gun owner. I inherited my two long guns from my dad and I have a pistol that I bought for the defense of my home. I believe that the 2nd Amendment provides Americans with a means to defend their country against tyranny and that guns can act a deterrent to home invasion crimes. Ill be keeping my guns and will defend the right of law abiding citizens to keep theirs as well. I also know that people with guns in their home are more likely to die from gunshot wounds because of the lack of safety measures. Its also hard for me to think of anything more terrible than a school shooting here in Augusta. And I know that domestic abusers and felons can purchase guns without a background check by going to a gun show or engaging in a private sale. And that angry people seeking vengeance can go purchase a gun without a waiting period. Some gun owners feel that its a slippery slope to have ANY limitations. If you give an inch theyll take a mile kind of thinking. I want other gun owners to know that in my time dealing with the Democratic party and listening to the different members and strategies I havent once heard any talk about a plan to take peoples guns. I think that the take peoples guns threat is an idea pushed by groups like the NRA to sway votes so that certain politicians can get to work making the rich richer and protecting corporate and other wealthy interests. The endless gun debate distracts people from the work of democracy. I say keep your guns. Keep your AR-10s and 15s and your semi-auto whatevers. Please keep them locked and unloaded if you have children in the home. Please make sure that other people dont have access to your guns. Thats part of responsible gun ownership.  I want to work with gun owners (like myself) and gun safety advocates (also me) to come together to make sure that gun owners have their rights protected but also have some common sense laws that protect our kids and protect people that are in abusive relationships. Lets get some common sense protections in place that we can all live with so we can get back to focusing on the economy healthcare senior issues and all the other important issues that we as Mainers face. I want to talk about guns when we are shooting at the range but there are other important things that we need to talk about too.,political,Facebook
"Virginia Governor Northam sued for Virginia & U.S. Constitution Violations. NEVER let Democrats take away your Constitutional Rights.  Below is a letter we wrote to several Republican lawmakers.  To: Virginia Republican Representatives  Re: Bypassing required Constitutional Amendments and legislative committee that sets rules for the Capitol Building violate the Virginia Constitution when outside the scope of only the Virginia State Legislators include Virginia Citizens involve public spaces or conflict with the Virginia and U.S. Constitutions.  America is a Constitutional Republic. One party or one person cannot ban the Constitution.  Violation of the Virginia Constitution occurred on 1/10/20 when new restrictions passed Friday by a legislative committee that sets rules for the Capitol building banned firearms within any building on Capitol Square and any building where lawmakers or their support staff have offices. Thereafter firearms were also banned outside on Capitol Grounds.  The Democrat majority of the Virginia House and Senate falsely assert that they have the right to change rules or laws; whereby a committee of a few (16 or 11%) is formed to receive bills debate pass and enact Virginia Law without the full vote of both houses. Moreover the process of a Constitutional Amendment must be followed for any firearm infringement to Virginia Constitution Article 13 Section 1. The new restrictions were passed unlawfully along party lines Friday on an 11-5 vote.-WSJ  The Governor on 11/14/20 unilaterally announced the outdoor Capitol Grounds gun ban.The Democrat Governor and Democrat legislators are violating the Constitution by not following the legal amendment process and making it illegal for Virginians to follow the Constitution. This is fascism.  A. The legislative committee that sets rules for the Capitol Building VIOLATED THE VIRGINIA CONSTITUTION when it voted to effect Virginia Citizens government property and the Virginia Constitution.  Virginia elected Delegates and Senators take an oath to support and uphold the Virginia and U.S. Constitutions. The amendment procedure is stated very clearly in the Virginia Constitution how a proposed bill or rule must be treated when Constitutional Rights that are already written and ratified are proposed to be amended.  When the following Articles of the Virginia Constitution are not adhered to the Constitutional Rights of citizens and aggrieved parties are violated; creating Civil Rights violations hardships and damages. ARTICLE II Section 7 Section 7. Oath or affirmation. All officers elected or appointed under or pursuant to this Constitution shall before they enter on the performance of their public duties severally take and subscribe the following oath or affirmation:  ""I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Virginia and that I will faithfully and impartially discharge all the duties incumbent upon me as .................... according to the best of my ability (so help me God)."" Article XII. Future Changes Sections 1 2  Section 1. Amendments Any amendment or amendments to this Constitution may be proposed in the Senate or House of Delegates and if the same shall be agreed to by a majority of the members elected to each of the two houses such proposed amendment or amendments shall be entered on their journals the name of each member and how he voted to be recorded and referred to the General Assembly at its first regular session held after the next general election of members of the House of Delegates. If at such regular session or any subsequent special session of that General Assembly the proposed amendment or amendments shall be agreed to by a majority of all the members elected to each house then it shall be the duty of the General Assembly to submit such proposed amendment or amendments to the voters qualified to vote in elections by the people in such manner as it shall prescribe and not sooner than ninety days after final passage by the General Assembly. If a majority of those voting vote in favor of any amendment it shall become part of the Constitution on the date prescribed by the General Assembly in submitting the amendment to the voters. Section 2. Constitutional convention. The General Assembly may by a vote of two-thirds of the members elected to each house call a convention to propose a general revision of or specific amendments to this Constitution as the General Assembly in its call may stipulate. The General Assembly shall provide by law for the election of delegates to such a convention and shall also provide for the submission in such manner as it shall prescribe and not sooner than ninety days after final adjournment of the convention of the proposals of the convention to the voters qualified to vote in elections by the people. If a majority of those voting vote in favor of any proposal it shall become effective on the date prescribed by the General Assembly in providing for the submission of the convention proposals to the voters.  The Democrats when it set the rules or voted on proposed bills or rules that would amend the Virginia Constitution by its mere creation of a committee or house vote knowingly violated their oath of office by violating the Virginia Constitution. Two-thirds of both Houses and an approval vote by eligible voters during a state-wide election are required to amend the Virginia Constitution.  A. An Amendment to the Virginia Constitution is required when a Constitutional Right already exists  The legislative committee that sets rules for the Capitol Building must be confined to ONLY its House members since the Capitol building is PUBLIC GOVERNMENT PROPERTY and VIOLATES the individual citizens 2nd Amendment Right to defend and protect themselves as stated in our US Constitution and the Virginia Constitution. In addition more than likely there are Democrats who would vote against these proposed laws or rule changes and did not have the opportunity to cast their vote in representation of their constituents as required in the Virginia Constitution. More egregiously it is highly likely that only those Democrats were pressured or chosen for committee to willingly RUBBER STAMP anything they are instructed to by their Democrat caucus; while Conspiring with the Executive Branch & outside state funding special interest influencers. It is foreseeable that These Democrat measures are resulting in a BREACH OF THE PEACE causing citizen unrest riots & protests due to the Democrat unconstitutional tactics.  The process of using a committee for mere Capital building rules is OVER ARCHING and OVER REACHING extending well beyond the legislative members that the rules are intended to cover. Once the general public citizenry and government property are involved and a law does involve infringement of the 2nd Amendment of the US Constitution and Virginia Constitution an Amendment to the Virginia Constitution must follow the Virginia Constitution Amendment process (passed by 2/3 house & 2/3 Senate signed by Governor and voted for approval by the majority of the eligible Virginia voters) is necessary and must be required for any rule policy and /or law change that must also NOT conflict with or violate the US Constitution. It is very clear that it is the intent of the Constitution for ALL lawmakers to be involved and vote on ALL matters. It is NOT the INTENT of the Virginia Constitution to circumvent a QUOROM and self-deal in small Democrat skewed committees. We rebelled against the British for TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION. American Citizens residing in Virginia demand REPRESENTATION BY ALL THEIR ELECTED officials.  In addition there are unconstitutional selective rules and enforcement of these rules as stated by the majority and Capital Police (only public passes through metal detectors and no gun ban enforcement for Delegates & Senators). The lives of elected lawmakers are NOT more important than the citizens who elect them. It violates the Virginia Constitution when the General public must go through metal detectors but lawmakers do not pass thru metal detectors and the general public will be prosecuted for firearm possession but lawmaker will not be prosecuted. Currently unequal PRIVILEGES & RIGHTS provide better 2nd Amendment protection for the Governor politicians entertainers special guests venues etc. because they all get armed security. We the People also deserve these same 2nd Amendment non-infringed rights to protection and to bear arms. Laws are NOT being faithfully executed by the Governor. In fact an INVESTIGATION of the Governor must be initiated to see if he alone or with others inside and outside the State of Virginia are VIOLATING the Virginia Constitution.  The following Articles and Sections of the Virginia Constitution are violated when laws or rules are enacted bypassing the required amendment process.  Article III Section 1  Section 1.

The General Assembly shall be vested with all the powers charged with all the duties and subject to all the limitations prescribed by this Constitution except that this session shall continue as long as may be necessary;  B. The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed  The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed is expressly stated in the Virginia and U.S. Constitutions affirmed by the United States Supreme Court in Heller v. D.C. and DiGiacinto v. George Mason University and Attorney General Cucinelli that the right to keep and bear arms guaranteed by the second amendment to the Constitution of the United States and which right is an inalienable part of our citizens heritage in this State shall not be infringed; that any action taken by the General Assembly of Virginia to interfere with this right would strike at the basic liberty of our citizens; that no agency of this State or of any political subdivision should be given any power or seek any power which would prohibit the purchase or possession of firearms by any citizen of good standing for the purpose of personal defense sport recreation or other noncriminal activities; and that registration of arms for which registration is not presently required not be required by legislative action of this body Although not in agreement DiGiacinto found a narrowly tailored gun ban to be ONLY applicable to sensitive spaces. The only one sensitive space in Capitol Building history is the above floor overlooking the gallery. A better decision would have been allowing an ordinance prohibiting discharge of a firearm in or along a public road or within 100 yards thereof or within 100 yards of a building occupied or used as a dwelling or place where the public gathers with exceptions for ones own dwelling or in the lawful defense of his own person or property or that of a member of his family. To date there has never been a criminal gun incident. In the past one lawmakers gun innocently accidentally discharged with no one struck and a lawmaker who forget his gun left it unattended and returned to him by the founder with no incident.  Therefore there is NO emergency or urgency to make the entire interior of the Capitol Building a sensitive space. Besides being Unconstitutional and an over reach this rule is overly burdensome to the lawmakers and the public causing huge lines congestion and wasted time. Such policies are ineffectual because persons who wish to perpetrate violence will ignore them and that the net effect of such policies is to leave defenseless the law-abiding citizens who follow these policies. That of course was the bitter lesson of the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre. Gun ban rules cause more risk of harm to lawmakers and general populations. While outside on line with thousands of people congregated in one open space a criminal shooter from the ground or from above has an easy target to maim and kill hundreds of innocent people in seconds. In addition if a criminal is able to sneak a firearm into a banned gun space they will shoot with no resistance till law enforcement arrives. The perfect example is the recent Texas Church hero who stopped a massacre in 6 seconds. Much faster than the usual 5 minute response by law enforcement. By enacting this unlawful rule not only have lawmakers put themselves and innocent citizens in harms way they have opened themselves up to reckless and gross negligence lawsuits against them if a criminal shooting were to occur because of their legislation.  Per the Virginia Constitution any change to the Virginia Constitution Article 1 Section 13 would require a Virginia Constitution Amendment.  Yet in Virginia there is legislation to ban AK-47s & AR-15s which are semi-automatic rifles and fire at the same rate as semi-automatic handguns. You might be surprised to hear that there were only 30 rifle homicides in Virginia last year; this includes the AR & AK assault rifle. There is NO such thing as an assault rifle. There is NO difference between an assault rifle and any other firearm except they look scarier. All firearms pointed at someone constitute the crime of assault.  Based on population rate Illegal aliens commit half the firearm homicides. The US population is about 320 million with illegal aliens making up 10% of the population (30 million) and committing 10% of all firearm homicides. Therefore illegal aliens commit half the firearm homicides on a population rate basis. So why is the State of Virginia enabling illegal aliens and sanctuary cities. To reduce gun crime ICE should be used by Virginia law enforcement to deport ALL illegal aliens.  All the facts demonstrate the need to lessen gun restrictions for law abiding individuals and eliminate gun free zones so innocent people can protect themselves and others. Good people with guns are NOT the problem. Good people with guns are needed for protection from bad people with guns based on our US Constitution. Our US & Virginia Constitutions State Code & Supreme Court say ""..right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed."" ; military should be governed by civil power.  militia shall consist of all able-bodied residents of Virginia who are citizens of the United States. Thats us.  There are 8.5 million Virginians. 2.8 million people of ALL political parties own firearms. Majority of homes have firearms. Of the 60000 Deaths In Virginia last year ONLY 340 were firearm homicides ZERO in my James City County. The Virginia firearm homicide rate is ONLY .004%. You have a better chance of getting struck by lightning than murdered with a gun. Virginia has the 4th lowest violent crime rate in the nation because un-infringed gun ownership is a deterrent.  Virginia doesnt have a firearm problem. Dangerous cities have a firearm-ban problem. Radical special interest groups falsely blame gun violence on law abiding Citizens in order to disguise their agenda of power money & control. In the US Annually gun owners prevent 2.5 million crimes. 90% of gun crime takes place in gun free zones. Criminals dont follow laws. If gun rights are taken away Virginians cant defend themselves and crime increases.  State Representatives have a duty & took an oath to uphold our Constitution. Since law enforcement does NOT have a duty to protect Virginians and government CANNOT guarantee our protection nothing should be done to infringe on Virginians rights to protect themselves with any firearm weapon they choose to be best for them.  Over 95% of Virginia jurisdictions have already committed to protecting the 2nd Amendment with various forms of a 2nd Amendment Sanctuary or Constitution Resolution endorsed by many Sheriffs with their willingness to deputize citizens in order to fulfill their oaths to the same Constitution guaranteeing that the right to bear arms SHALL NOT be infringed; so citizens can protect themselves and assist law enforcement by deterring or preventing crime. This action sends a resounding message to preserve our Constitutional Rights and keep Virginia safe & secure.  If Democrats choose not to follow the law and the will of the people they are violating the law subject to arrest ALL legislative time will be wasted and the Virginia budget will be spent in court battles for the next two years until Democrats are NOT re-elected.  The following Virginia Constitution Articles and their Sections support the assertion that the Democrats have acted unlawfully with respect to the violation of Virginians Constitutional Rights.  BILL OF RIGHTS Virginia Article 1 Sections 13 7 5 4 3 2 1 A DECLARATION OF RIGHTS made by the good people of Virginia in the exercise of their sovereign powers which rights do pertain to them and their posterity as the basis and foundation of government.  - Section 13. Militia; standing armies; military subordinate to civil power. That a well-regulated militia composed of the body of the people trained to arms is the proper natural and safe defense of a free state therefore the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed; that standing armies in time of peace should be avoided as dangerous to liberty; and that in all cases the military should be under strict subordination to and governed by the civil power.  - Section 7. Laws should not be suspended. That all power of suspending laws or the execution of laws by any authority without consent of the representatives of the people is injurious to their rights and ought not to be exercised.  - Section 5. Separation of legislative executive and judicial departments; periodical elections. That the legislative executive and judicial departments of the Commonwealth should be separate and distinct; and that the members thereof may be restrained from oppression by feeling and participating the burthens of the people they should at fixed periods be reduced to a private station return into that body from which they were originally taken and the vacancies be supplied by regular elections in which all or any part of the former members shall be again eligible or ineligible as the laws may direct.  - Section 4. No exclusive emoluments or privileges; offices not to be hereditary. That no man or set of men is entitled to exclusive or separate emoluments or privileges from the community but in consideration of public services; which not being descendible neither ought the offices of magistrate legislator or judge to be hereditary.  - Section 3. Government instituted for common benefit. That government is or ought to be instituted for the common benefit protection and security of the people nation or community; of all the various modes and forms of government that is best which is capable of producing the greatest degree of happiness and safety and is most effectually secured against the danger of maladministration; and whenever any government shall be found inadequate or contrary to these purposes a majority of the community hath an indubitable inalienable and indefeasible right to reform alter or abolish it in such manner as shall be judged most conducive to the public weal.  - Section 1. Equality and rights of men. That all men are by nature equally free and independent and have certain inherent rights of which when they enter into a state of society they cannot by any compact deprive or divest their posterity; namely the enjoyment of life and liberty with the means of acquiring and possessing property and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety.  - Section 2. People the source of power. That all power is vested in and consequently derived from the people that magistrates are their trustees and servants and at all times amenable to them.  In addition Virginia Code  44-146.15. Construction of chapter states  Nothing in this chapter is to be construed to: (1) Limit modify or abridge the authority of the Governor to exercise any powers vested in him under other laws of this Commonwealth independent of or in conjunction with any provisions of this chapter; (2) Interfere with dissemination of news or comment on public affairs; but any communications facility or organization including but not limited to radio and television stations wire services and newspapers may be required to transmit or print public service messages furnishing information or instructions in connection with actual or pending disaster; (3) Empower the Governor any political subdivision or any other governmental authority to in any way limit or prohibit the rights of the people to keep and bear arms as guaranteed by Article I Section 13 of the Constitution of Virginia or the Second Amendment of the Constitution of the United States including the otherwise lawful possession carrying transportation sale or transfer of firearms except to the extent necessary to ensure public safety in any place or facility designated or used by the Governor any political subdivision of the Commonwealth or any other governmental entity as an emergency shelter or for the purpose of sheltering persons; (4) Affect the jurisdiction or responsibilities of police forces firefighting forces units of the armed forces of the United States or any personnel thereof when on active duty; but state local and inter-jurisdictional agencies for emergency services shall place reliance upon such forces in the event of declared disasters; or (5) Interfere with the course of conduct of a labor dispute except that actions otherwise authorized by this chapter or other laws may be taken when necessary to forestall or mitigate imminent or existing danger to public health or safety.  For ALL the aforementioned reasons as stated in the Virginia Constitution The legislative committee that sets rules for the Capitol Building violated the Virginia Constitution when it voted to effect Virginia Citizens and government property. The Governor also violated his oath of office by unlawfully using the State of Emergency statute to further his unlawful agenda that infringes on gun rights. An Amendment to the Virginia Constitution is required when a Constitutional Right already exists; the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.  Therefore any laws or rules promulgated under this committee system or when a Virginia Constitutional Right pre-exists must never be passed and must be vacated.",political,Facebook
"The fight for constitutional liberty and free markets did not end with the 2018 state legislative election.  A vote for Ryan McClain in 2020 is a vote to restore freedom and defend the entire Bill of Rights.  I am a very different kind of Republican I believe in protecting all of your freedoms all of the time. I am NOT the establishment  On The Issues:  EDUCATION: Ohio's education system is broken establishment Republicans took office with promise to decrease government overreach in Ohio education and yet they have done the exact opposite. As Representative I will fight to abolish the outdated End-of-course tests and replace it all with absolutely nothing.  The role of a teacher is to prepare our kids for the future and how can our educators do that if educators are forced to squeeze an entire months worth of tests in? The curriculum should be decided by the educator not the government. I will set forth a plan to legalize school choice to A. give the less fortunate a chance to attend better schools and B. give ""bad schools"" the incentive to improve.  I will do everything I can to end bullying including not just holding bullies accountable for their actions but holding school districts accountable for neglect and disregard towards their students who suffer from bullying and mental illness.  CUTTING TAXES: I believe that under my tax plan if you like your money you can keep your money.  I want to entirely abolish the majority of tax code and start from scratch taxation ought to be kept minimal and this means that the Ohio Income Tax has gotta GO!!! You as a citizen should be able to keep much more of what you earn plain and simple.  We need to balance the budget; My goal is to put Ohio a surplus not debt.  GUN RIGHTS: I am A PROUD supporter of the 2nd Amendment to the United States Constitution and I believe that my gun permit is something called the Bill of Rights.  The second amendment is the cornerstone of our constitution. In my belief every single amendment to the bill of rights is essential and the second amendment gives us the physical tools needed to defend the bill of rights.  Politicians in Ohio are trying to take your 2ND Amendment rights away citing fear but remember that fear was the same mentality that awarded us with the patriot act illegal NSA surveillance endless wars overseas drone strikes killing thousands of innocents under the Obama administration and several other unconstitutional government measures.  Our children are much safer when someone has the power to defend them. If you outlaw or even restrict guns than by legal definition only criminals have weapons. Are you genuinely comfortable with only criminals having guns? I want our students to live which is why we should be fighting for our teachers to have the right to defend our students. AR-15s? Bump stocks? They are not your enemy. The enemy is banning those objects which will in turn only grant those who are breaking the law access to those objects.  There is no such thing as a ""common sense"" restraint on the constitution; the constitution was written to restrain the government and not the other way around. Remember that it was founding father Benjamin Franklin who warned that ""those who wish to give up liberty for a false sense of security will gain neither and lose both.""  LGBTQ+ RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES: Everyone no matter who you are deserves the same rights opportunities freedoms and liberties.  there is a lot of work to do. LGTBQ+ Citizens are discriminated against and this is immoral. We should be working to bring Ohio together not tear our state apart with laws dictating where a transgender individual can use the bathroom.  I support any legislation that is meant to protect the LGBTQ+ Community. LGBTQ+ People need these civil rights protections especially in area's where society is more discriminatory than in other areas.  Discrimination in my view is bullying and I would hope that most people would see bullying as a completely unacceptable behavior in 2018.  In my belief this viewpoint is completely in support of individual liberty. I've always followed something called the Non-Aggression Principle which means that yes you can live your life as you please as long as you don't cause harm to someone or take their stuff. Discrimination does both of that. Discrimination on the basis of something that the individual cannot control (ex. color sexual orientation gender identity) causes harm whether physically or mentally to the person being wrongly discriminated and discrimination takes away the victims self-worth in society and that is something I no longer wish to witness.  Remember that we are all beautiful people under the eys of god that we are all worth something and that we should be a community that judges NOT by color sexual orientation gender identity/ expression but by the content of character.  THE RIGHT TO LIFE: I'm pro life at my heart I believe that we should always defend the sanctity of life my view on this is slightly different then from 2018. I believe that life begins conception abortions should not continue (with exceptions examples including of cases of a crime of sexual nature committed against the woman or cases of threats to the mothers health)  I will not vote to allow late term abortions. There is absolutely no justification for the murder of a child.  If you vote for Republican Ryan McClain for State Representative in 2020 you will be voting for a candidate who respects life.",political,Facebook

Let Us All Learn From and Never Forget Parkland  On this day exactly one year ago a gunman killed 17 people and wounded 17 others at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland Florida. This horrific incident mobilized students and gun reform activists across America to demand gun reform in their communities. In Florida legislation was passed that increased the age of a person to buy a firearm from 18 to 21 and in addition it banned bump stocks created a three-day waiting period to purchase a firearm or until a background check was completed while also increasing funding for the mental health needs in Floridas public schools among other measures. I was a primary co-sponsor of a bill in NC that wouldve brought many similar reforms to our state. In addition I filed a separate bill to adequately fund our states needs for school psychologists and school counselors as well as a bill which would allow for a court to enter an extreme risk protective order that would allow guns to be temporarily removed from persons where there was evidence from family members or law enforcement that they would use the weapons for themselves or others.  This year I am using my best efforts to pursue bipartisan approaches that will address some of these issues. When this type of legislation has been successfully enacted in other states it has been with bipartisan support. It is too early to know if my efforts as well as the efforts of others will be successful however I can assure you that I will make a 200% commitment to achieving bipartisan solutions to these problems. I would hate to think that NC must suffer a tragedy like Parkland before we meaningfully address the multitude of issues that result in gun violence.,political,Facebook
"Jack Hamby is 13 and has lived with his father Darin Hamby a Registered Nurse since he was 2. He's been held against his will by his mother (who he's said is physically and emotionally abusive from age 3) since April 8th with the blessing and assistance of Madison County Chancery Court judge Robert Clark (662.834.1285)  Jack has gotten old enough to understand how dysfunctional his mother Shayna Russum owner of Shayna's boutique in Ridgeland is and had stopped going to see her. Her claim was that he had to have been ""alienated"" and the only way she could have a relationship with her own son is if I was incarcerated. Seriously. She asked for it multiple times in her filed motions and repeatedly on the witness stand.  Clark decided the best thing was for Jack to be forcibly removed from the only home he's ever known by men with guns and isolated with his abusers. All contact with me forbidden by the judge and with his friends/family forbidden by his mother. This to continue until such time as Shayna has made ""substantial progress"". This in spite of the fact that the judge who presided over our divorce hearing for nearly 5 years had specifically stated that Shayna wasn't given custody because of her history of alienation of her other children and her likelihood of doing the same to Jack.  Each and every day since this travesty occurred Jack has used the only voice he has and refused to assist in his own programming. He's said loudly and clearly ""HELP ME!!!"" by not attending therapy as the judge had reportedly directed the previous therapist what Jack was to be treated for and the manner of his treatment.  Jack was ordered (under threat of his father's incarceration AND custody ""automatically"" being given to his mother) to get ""therapy"" from Dr. Mark Webb (601.853.2676). According to Webb the judge had given him Jack's diagnosis and treatment plan and Jack had to follow it exactly or else. Webb threatened Jack with juvenile detention among other things in an attempt to coerce Jack. He failed. He encouraged him to go visit his mother anyway in spite of being afraid by telling him that ""My money's on you"" when Jack asked what he was supposed to do if his mother and her most current husband both started abusing him again. Why would the psychiatrist thinks it's OKAY to let Jack go somewhere with the expectation that he would have to fight for survival?!? When Jack clearly stated that he'd rather be dead than be put in that situation and at the first opportunity he would kill himself he was ignored. He told a psychiatrist that he was going to kill himself and was dismissed by him. His mother Shayna laughed out loud and said ""Ridiculous!"". Jack was forced to see this doc by the court and the doc billed at least $8000 for his involuntary patient. No wonder he was so enthusiastic about allowing a lawyer to decide the treatment his patient received in direct violation of his oaths.  He's also not doing ANY schoolwork tests etc at school although he is attending. He failed school last year despite her having him less than 2 months at the end of the year. He has maintained an ""A"" average his entire scholastic career. His earlier achievement test showed he was at college level on many subjects.  She's taken his phone although she lied to the police and Jack and agreed to let him keep it when he first went into captivity. She's also let unsafe adults in his proximity repeatedly.  Please repost this call email write letters ANYTHING you can think of until Jack is safe. He's at VERY high risk!!  We're flying POW/MIA flags and have yellow ribbons around our trees and pins for our shirts. Please write him if only to let him know people care what happens to him. The entirety of the legal system has failed him miserably.  Bring Jack home safe TODAY!!",political,Facebook

"To answer some questions received in PM I will also answer publicly.  Q: Voter ID A: I support voter ID 100 percent.  Q: Puberty blocking medications and/or medication introduced to children to promote sex change. A: I do not believe a parent should be able to force these medications on a child. A child is not mentally developed enough to understand consequences of said medications which include a high risk of suicide. These medications should be reserved for individuals having reached an appropriate age who can decide for themselves as well as form a mature understanding of these medications.  Q: Taxes A: #TAXATIONISTHEFT It is my stance that no more tax burdens be added to our citizens. I understand that a state needs revenue to run and to help its citizens. I also believe that payroll taxes are not necessary as proven by other states.  Q: Education A: I am married to a teacher and understand the frustrations on both sides as a parent and a teacher. We should be getting feedback from our teachers to see what exactly is working and what is not.  Q: Marriage A: We should not be asking the State's Permission to enter into a Civil Union.  Q: Veterans A: I am a disabled veteran. I will do anything I can to help all veterans.  Q: Guns A: BUY all you want and carry daily. I'll join you. Now I agree with FREE background checks. Some citizens have had their rights stripped by due process.  Q: Gun Shows A: YES I agree that we should close the ""no background check"" loophole. I believe that is responsible and reasonable.  Q: Abortions A: My stance is clear. No. I believe we need to put Abortion as a ballot measure to strengthen further legislation.  Q: Justice Reform A: The first step do away with private for profit prisons who make money from taxpayers and get paid even when beds are empty. These contracts have a minimum occupancy rate which means that we MUST imprison citizens to keep them happy.  Q: Marijuana A: We need to decriminalize minor possession. We need to expand our industry and catch up with other states.  Q: Term limits A: I want a two term limit and I will only serve two terms if I am elected to two terms. After that it is time for fresh eyes and fresh perspectives.  I hope this answers a few questions for everyone.  Neil",political,Facebook
Subterfuge and Candor - Charlie's Soapbox 6/21/19  When I hear people say that Obama is responsible for the good economy we are experiencing it reminds me of a statement Obama made about manufacturing jobs in America.  He said some of those jobs of the past are just not gonna come back and questioned Donald Trumps ability to do what he was promising to bring back manufacturing jobs he even went on to mockingly ask What magic wand do you have?  And statements about the new reality a scenario where America must accept a reduction in lifestyle a downgrading of our economy and acceptance of our industry moving out of the country taking good paying jobs with them to nations with much lower pay scales where they manufacture products and sell them in the USA without penalty.  I dont think Barack Obama really wanted to see America be all it could be I believe Obama saw America as a bully as an expansionist nation forcing our will on the world at large a repressive tyrant that needed to be brought down a notch or two and take its place in the New World Order a placating passive nation of repentant supplicants forever apologizing for our greatness and paring it down by sharing it with the world.  I think the statements Obama made to describe those he so disagreed with and feared was the one about people clinging to their guns or religion and America is no longer a Christian nation most clearly define the disparity of his ideas about America.  Most all the people I associate with believe in Almighty God own guns that they will never give up without a fight and I dont know where President Obama got his stats but America is still by and large a Christian country.  I think what he meant was that the people who clung to their God and guns and practiced Christianity were standing in the way of the kind of future he envisioned for America where the government controlled everything setting itself up as some kind of pseudo-deity.  Christians will never accept government as their god and people with guns are willing to protect their stand against any government who would infringe on their beliefs.  Obamas third term insofar as intent and policy was to be carried on by Hillary Clinton.  Along comes Donald Trump a New York real estate developer and former television star brash abrasive pugnacious plain-spoken afraid of no one who could trade punches with any politician or pundit willing to stand toe to toe with any detractor and insist that his concept of America was totally different from Obama Clinton et al.  He believed - and made the disenfranchised believe - that those jobs Obama declared gone forever could come back that America could drill frack and pump our way out of the clutches of oil producing countries in the Middle East who hate our guts.  He believed in the sanctity of life and stood against the wholesale abortion policies of Obama.  He was pro-gun pro-Israel embraced Christianity and told us that with the easing of regulations and some sane tax policy that the manufacturing jobs we had lost or basically given away under Obama could be brought back on shore.  He told us that NAFTA was a bad deal for us and should be either renegotiated or abolished he told us that China had for decades taken advantage of our lax trade policies and should be made to toe the line with tariffs if necessary.  He told us he wanted to Make America Great Again and that GDP numbers in the 2% range were totally unacceptable.  He told us we needed a wall to help stem the overwhelming flow of people and drugs across our borders.  He told us he would appoint Supreme Court judges who would level the playing field against the liberal onslaught of the Obama appointees.  And despite the biggest and most concentrated all-out war by Democrats media and even some establishment members of his own party using government agencies false FISA court warrants a US Senator who has turned his whole tenure into trying to impeach him he has been able to deliver on most of what he promised.  At present we have twenty-four Democrat candidates vying for their partys nomination for president as far as I can see there is only one plank in the Democrat platform and that is to get rid of Trump.  So for a minute lets say they did get rid of Trump what would they do? Where would they take the country  All we have so far is that they would repeal most of what Trump has done which would mean higher taxes bigger government repressive regulations and all the other suffocating crap liberals can come up with.  So what would happen to the stock market?  What happens to manufacturing?  What happens to trade policies with China and the rest of the world?  What happens to the military buildup Trump initiated? Liberals and the military are like oil and water.  What happens with the Democrats open border policies when the entitlement rolls - and most of the Democrat candidates think the undocumented should be on them - what happens when they reach critical mass?  Of course what Ive addressed here is but the tip of a very large and very volatile iceberg.  And in November of next year we will learn if this iceberg will be pushed back out to sea or allowed to stay in port and cause a flood of unmanageable proportions.  What do you think?  Pray for our troops our police and the peace of Jerusalem.  God Bless America  Charlie Daniels,political,Facebook
"""Id like to speak about our gun rights and politicians. One thing that I find very frustrating is the lack of political push-back against the anti-gun crowd.  How many times have we seen an ignorant claim about guns or gun owners made by those on the left only to hear crickets from those we elected to support our rights? I can tell you partly why that is.  Many times it is because those elected have very little actual first-hand knowledge on firearms.  They do have our best interests at heart but they dont have the comprehensive knowledge like I have to immediately respond on the floor of the house or senate. Thats how laws that infringe on our rights get passed. Unlike those lawmakers I am a prolific shooter in most all shooting disciplines.  When you vote for Herv Breault the people of the 125th District will have a subject matter expert in protecting our gun rights. I know firearms backwards and forwards and Im an NRA Certified Pistol Instructor.  In 2019 I took first place in two National Competition matches and took third in an aggregate National Championship. I own and regularly shoot everything from an AR-15 to an 18th Century style Flintlock rifle and thats not including my handguns. Shooting and hunting are my number one hobbies and something I am very passionate about.  Anybody can talk the talk on gun rights but you need someone who actually walks the walk to fight for your rights.  Many times an ignorant claim by an anti-gun politician comes off as credible...because there wasnt a pro-gun lawmaker that had the intimate knowledge to immediately show the false claim as dead wrong. You see its important to know what youre speaking about.  Supporting our rights is very important but supporting without intimate knowledge that puts a lawmaker at a distinct disadvantage when debating a point against anti-gun politicians. The leftists have a ton of emotional anti-gun false talking points and I can knock each point down with truth and logic.  With todays relentless attack on our rights you need someone like me to represent you. I will fight hard for your rights and push-back against anti-gun politicians.  You need someone that can set the record straight due to their familiarity with firearms as well as with our rights. For many years I have studied the basis and background for both the 2nd Amendment and Pennsylvanias Article 1 Section 21. I know these were not rights granted to us by the government but rather rights that the government were not to touch.  If you are seeking the best person to protect your rights Im asking the people of the 125th District to either vote by mail or get to the polls April 28th (primary date may change) and vote for Herv Breault in the Primary Election to be the Republican nominee for the November General Election.  Please go to my Facebook page and like the page so you will get regular updates from me. Be safe everyone and I wish the best of health for you and your family. Im praying for you all!""",political,Facebook
"The cold-blooded murder of peaceful people of faith yesterday in Squirrel Hill reminds us just how important our elected leaders are in protecting our health and wellbeing. Without sensible gun violence prevention reform we may never truly be safe.  If Senator Ross had agreed to a #debate you might have already heard about the stark differences between us in this area of policy. For example he has consistently been rated A by the National Rifle Association. He voted to make guns more accessible by making it easier to obtain a firearm license. And in his own words he opposed ""in the strongest possible terms"" the enforcement of our Commonwealths assault weapons ban.  In contrast has awarded me the Gun Sense Candidate distinction. I am also a proponent of firearm access restrictions in domestic violence circumstances and firearm registration like motor vehicle registration.  My opponents stance on guns not only puts us at risk but is out of sync with the views of his constituents. We need leadership we can count on to promote responsible gun safety so everyone in the Commonwealth has a chance to live their happiest healthiest lives.  On Tuesday November 6th you have a real choice for State Senate. I respectfully ask for your vote to end the violence.

One week away from election. We have worked so hard since January. Researching listening building relationships and doing what it takes to earn your support.  At this time I would like to give you some details from our first 100 day plan. We all know our team stands on ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND MAKING THE CITY OF LOUISVILLE SAFER. WTBS we plan on working IMMEDIATELY with surrounding counties and entrepreneurs on bringing new industries into town. There is a great need for affordable housing in Louisville following the tornado in 2014 that left so many mourning the loss of their loved ones a well as their homes. Quality housing for young families looking to move here as well as those already establishing themselves here is a great need as well. We have already made connections with people and already have some plans in motion. I also think we can spread more city contracts in Louisville. Using the same vendors for services in Louisville doesnt spread the wealth throughout more entrepreneurs here. We plan to look into exploring some TIF District options to produce more industries immediately! I also plan to immediately get more involved with our school district.  We plan on working directly with our major factories here on offering technical training for the jobs of tomorrow for our teens. We plan to do this through paid internships. There are grants available for this type of assistance and my associates are already on top of doing what it takes to be eligible for them. I think teaching teens how to weld paint sew farm hook up electricity proper etc will create a more stable employability pipeline in Louisville.  I am very passionate about cracking down on crime in Louisville. I think we must get more serious about murder burglary robbery and drugs in Louisville. Especially when it comes to our teens. We have a lot of teens in our area with guns in their hand. That is one reason why we have plans for a gun buy back program. All unregistered guns stolen guns etc turned in will be rewarded by knocking off some funds on their fines. Let's not shy away from the truth! I think our investigators could have more resources to help solve crime. More police cars going home with officers WHO LIVE IN THE CITY LIMITS has been known to be successful in other areas as well. Research has shown that more police presence in the community helps lower crime. We must foster a better relationship between law enforcement and the community. We should be comfortable with our police officers. I feel there is a major distance between the two.  I also plan to research how we can get some state and federal assistance with our aging infrastructure. For example we have too many streets with pot holes. We also lack sidewalks throughout the city. A more walkable city in all areas help communities thrive. We could have more bike lanes in the city as well to help attract more bikers. It will make riding bikes safer for adults and children. All these things help attract more people to our town.  Last but not least we are very serious about more after school and recreational programs in Louisville. We need more programs for kids in single parent homes. These kids need help more than we know. I think this presence will help strengthen our community. I also have a great plan for prison reform. Something for serious convicts who want to come home and get back into the workforce. Another one of our immediate plans is to put two basketball goals at the Dawkins and MLK intersection. We only have 3 courts available in town and they are all in Ward 3 at one location. These plans are only a portion of our plans for better parks in Louisville. Only maintaining one park doesn't create use opportunities for all. There should be a park for kids near every major living area.  All these ideas are what we plan to jump into IMMEDIATELY if we are elected for office. Yes we are aware of the city budget however we wholeheartedly believe these ideas will help Louisville become a thriving community for all. The time is NOW Louisville. Let's be the change WE need!  Join our marathon and #RunWithRionJune82021 to make Louisville the GREATEST city in the state of MS!,political,Facebook

Coronavirus is real. My mother succumbed to it yesterday. She was in the risk group she was 88 years old with Alzheimers living in a nursing home in NYC. She wanted a better life for us. I know she would not want to see society and the lives of her children and grandchildren destroyed because of the virus. How long can we be on lockdown?  It seems the virus is being used to accomplish the far left progressive agenda. People are dependent on government for money Freedom of movement and assembly are restricted Guns shops are being closed Churches are being closed No political rallies Trillions in government spending Speaking against the over response is mocked and silenced People kept apart from each other People controlled by fear Prisoners being let out of jail Law breaking has no punishment People are kept off the streets Unemployment up Jobs down Economy crashing President cant claim how good things are anymore Mockery of Make America Great Again We must follow the experts  Things like this dont just happen. However it came about the virus is being used to control us and take away our civil liberties.  Andrew Cuomo celebrates passing late term abortion but says every life must be protected from covid-19. I am pro-life. The left claims women have the right to abort a child but we dont have the right to leave our homes or interact because we may get sick? They can end a life but we cant make choices about our own? They tried to sneak Planned Parenthood funding into the bill. Bizarre on one hand they want to preserve life on the other they want to take it. If life is so precious that we must shut down society to preserve it why doesnt that apply to the unborn?  There have been 16 deaths in Arizona a state of 7.4 million people.  So many have died protecting freedom at Normandy Gettysburg and countless other battles in American history. We have been willing to die for our freedom but now we have been cowed into submission by a virus that the vast majority will have little or no symptoms. Plus they are repressing the actual positive results of hydroxychloroquine and Zithromax because they want the hysteria to continue. Everything they couldnt accomplish through the Russia and Impeachment hoaxs they are accomplishing through the virus. And I say this as someone who lost a parent due to the virus. The older we get the more at risk we are to illness and the closer we are to death these are facts that no politician can change.  But once our Liberty dies we will never get it back.,political,Facebook
"THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE Please take time to read there are serious issues here if you happen to be immature less than educated just ignore I apologize for the #facebook for taking you for a mature person and invading your timeline you don't have to show everyone. Part one INTRO "" Life is a game of connect the dots if you don't connect all the dots and the right order you will never get the picture"". I made up this quote when I started my blogpage on ""blogspot"" back in 2006. I had been writing for years even back then but mostly commenting on what others were writing or on news and opinion columns trying to get on air on rightwing talk shows to comment on O'Reilly Hannity Limbaugh Mark Levine Boortz. You name it. Not that I a #Democrat or a hopeless #liberal but because the talk radio in my area was extremely #conservative #Republican. One cannot always agree with anyone but if you are limited in your knowledge because your only source of knowledge is one radio station one TV channel or everything that a similar bent on news and information you have only read one book in your life you always listen to or follow only one kind of information then you are not learned you are not thinking for yourself you are a parrot a robot a tape recorder just push rewind and spew out what you think you ""know"". At least you have convinced yourself that you are knowledgeable. What borders on ""ignorance""  Mexico and Canada said someone but I digress ""arrogance"" was my answer. ""We are limited in our knowledge by what we know"". What do we know really. We most of us anyway say that we know about the politics the economics the history and whatever other subject at hand but what do we really know? What is our background? What have we studied to maje such a claim? Shouldn't we first open our eyes and learn somethings first? ( this the start of the article I will be adding to it as I go along and find more time my intention is to link it back to the last article on ""Trust"" . Since Facebook does not allow poitical articles to be promoted without a disclaimer I had to keep the article on Trust apolitical but it goes together you will see). M. N. R. 20 JULY 2020  PART TWO INTO THE ABYSS Time passes quickly as you get older they say it also passes quickly when you have a busy schedule or your mind is occupied with the worries of the world the future the future of humanity itself. We are too proud to admit that we fail we were taught that we are something when we were not we were raised to be failures. People who complain about the participation trophies are the same ones that beat up the coaches when their own child is benched they are the same ones that get in fist fights at the kids ball games they are the ones that refuse to wear a mask and threaten a cashier at a dollar store . For long I have complained about the ""privileged people"" everyone is privileged everyone is an enigma everyone has a right to whatever they want. When we see people complaining about riots and looting it is the same people that carry guns in the grocery stores and threaten the nation's stability by threatening of a civil war if they don't get their way. I have said before that BLM is on the wrong track it should be more organized more like the Black Panthers awakening the black population providing leadership and guidance while politically working to reduce police violence. Not just show up after every black killing at the hands of the police. The white population on the other hand has a political leadership that is willing to sacrifice the country the #Constitution and the rule of law to maintain power. While it is true that there is way too much black on black crime killing and violence the cure is not oppression and clamp down that only breeds resentment. The heavy handed response is not productive. At the same time we should notice that the establishment allows the black protests to simmer under the oppression until it boils over and until it gets out of control and the mob takes over destroying any legitimacy of the protest. It happened after Trevon Martin after Micheal Brown after Tamir Rice and after Floyd George when will people learn. Every time the mob takes over and the racists come out and steal the discussion. Right now the country has much bigger and more immediate problems the #COVID-19 the unemployment the homelessness the evictions and more and the political class is getting away scot free with their theft while the people arr arguing about black and white and kneeling in protest and racism. Just like the pimps the psychologists and the preachers the politicians also need blind and dumb followers that are willing to sacrifice themselves for the ""cause""  for the faith. Democracy and freedom are not for everyone we are afraid of having to learn to make choices to make decisions and take the responsibility for the consequences. And the corrupt take the lead and the rest of us follow we want to believe we want to belong and like a one wanting to be a part of the ""gang"" we allow ourselves to be raped willingly though. M. N. R. 29 JULY 2020  Part three RANDOM PSYCHOLOGY  This should never have been an issue about race but the political leadership on both sides has turned in to a race issue for their own political giant and gamesmanship. As I ranted about the BLM misusing this  I also tried to goad the whites about their silence on the issue. Time after time I used the examples of whites being killed unjustly by the police while the white population sits on its hands. The issue was turned in to white vs black and the guilty party got away laughing. All Lives Matter or the Blue lives Matter is not even an issue. All lives matter then we should say that Justice matters the Constitution Matters and the rule of law matters. The real problem we have is the militarization of police the police abuse of power and the unjust laws written by the politicians at all levels that keeps the poor poor and thus ""in their place"". If the morality is hard to practice by a poor person then the poverty has been made a crime. I have given examples as to how enforcement of unjust laws itself causes the poor to break the law. Be it child support unpaid tickets petty theft drug dealing all are a direct result of poverty and abuse of the poor by the law makers and their enforcer hordes. There is not a lot of killing by the police in fact more whites are killed by the police than blacks but if you watch the news see the reactions and claims by the politicians you will be confused as to the facts and reality. From time to time I have posted the news about black on black violence but you wouldn't care. If you are black you probably don't want to hear it if you white you use it to excuse the police misconduct. It is not the time for finger pointing not the time for a race war or a civil war that we will all lose the whole country will lose. It is time to question our political leaders as to what price we should pay for freedoms. I have talked about the Patriot act the NDAA  suspension of the #Constitution and loss of our civil rights. How is it that we are okay with the fed taking over our cities how is it that we are not complaining against our prisons where our brothers sisters  fathers and sons are being raped molested beaten killed or rented out for slave labor. What are we taking our country back to when can't even take our country and our own freedom back. What are we so proud of please tell me be real and be open be serious also. Black or White. This is unacceptable the hired cops the paid thugs on our streets are no different than the scabs that were brought in to break the strikes during our labor movements. Study history learn the truth about our ugly past the real truth. M. N. R. 02 AUGUST 2020",political,Facebook

Voters! Voters of KY 4th District. You can change the direction that we are going with your vote tomorrow. Thomas Massie has not brought back one Dime or one job to his District. He has one of the highest voting records yet he is dead last on sponsored and cosponsored Bills. He voted No 324 times but yes to allow the sale of assault rifles bump stalks and the manufacturer and sale of plastic guns. He doesnt work with his own party membersand he cant reach across the aisle for help either. He did not Campaign or attend any county or local forums and yet he spent $350000 campaigning? He has spoken at several right to life meetings but professes to be a member of the Libertarian and Liberty party. They are both PRO CHOICE (look them up its number 1 on their platform). Face it Thomas Massie has done nothing for Kentucky. He has no vision or plans to move Kentucky forward. He is a smooth talking professional politician. He looks at fulfilling his own agenda and his pockets while leaving Kentucky behind. He is counting on you the voter. He is hoping you will be complacent while he hides under the banner of the Republican Party.  Its not to late if you want to move Kentucky forward! I am someone who has a vision and plan that will listen and work to accomplish those goals (and pay for them) without the party ties and has family values and wants to see every family prosper. Then you need to vote for the Independent Candidate with a change to move Kentucky forward.  Vote for Mike Moffett!  He will put the word Representative back into KY 4th District!,political,Facebook
"I read this letter every now and then. It reminds how much we owe to those that fight and protect us- It's a bit long but an excellent read.  This letter was written by Charles Grennel and his comrades who are veterans of the Global War on Terror. Grennel is an Army Reservist who spent two years in Iraq and was a principal in putting together the first Iraqi elections January of 2005. It was written to (left students name out on purpose) who is one of the students at the University of Washington who did not want to honor Medal of Honor winner USMC Colonel Greg Boyington because she does not think those who serve in the U.S. Armed services are good role models.  To: Addressee (student UW)  Subject: Sheep Wolves and Sheepdogs  Dear Miss xxxxxxxx  I read of your student activity regarding the proposed memorial to Col Greg Boyington USMC a Medal of Honor winner. I suspect you will receive a bellyful of angry e-mails from conservative folks like me. You may be too young to appreciate fully the sacrifices of generations of servicemen and servicewomen on whose shoulders you and your fellow students stand. I forgive you for the untutored ways of youth and your naivet. It may be that you are simply a sheep. There's no dishonor in being a sheep--as long as you know and accept what you are.  William J. Bennett in a lecture to the United States Naval Academy November 24 1997 said ""Most of the people in our society are sheep. They are kind gentle productive creatures who can only hurt one another by accident.""  We may well be in the most violent times in history but violence is still remarkably rare. This is because most citizens are kind decent people who are not capable of hurting each other except by accident or under extreme provocation. They are sheep. Then there are the wolves and the wolves feed on the sheep without mercy. Do you believe there are wolves out there that will feed on the flock without mercy? You better believe it. There are evil men in this world and they are capable of evil deeds. The moment you forget that or pretend it is not so you become a sheep. There is no safety in denial.  Then there are sheepdogs and I'm a sheepdog. I live to protect the flock and confront the wolf. If you have no capacity for violence then you are a healthy productive citizen--a sheep. If you have a capacity for violence and no empathy for your fellow citizens then you have defined an aggressive sociopath--a wolf. But what if you have a capacity for violence and a deep love for your fellow citizens? What do you have then? A sheepdog a warrior someone who is walking the uncharted path. Someone who can walk into the heart of darkness into the universal human phobia and walk out unscathed.  We know that the sheep live in denial--that is what makes them sheep. They do not want to believe that there is evil in the world. They can accept the fact that fires can happen which is why they want fire extinguishers fire sprinklers fire alarms and fire exits throughout their kids' schools. But many of them are outraged at the idea of putting an armed police officer in their kids school. Our children are thousands of times more likely to be killed or seriously injured by school violence than fire but the sheep's only response to the possibility of violence is denial. The idea of someone coming to kill or harm their child is just too hard and so they choose the path of denial.  The sheep generally do not like the sheepdog. He looks a lot like the wolf. He has fangs and the capacity for violence. The difference though is that the sheepdog must not cannot and will not ever harm the sheep. Any sheep dog that intentionally harms the lowliest little lamb will be punished and removed. The world cannot work any other way at least not in a representative democracy or a republic such as ours. Still the sheepdog disturbs the sheep. He is a constant reminder that there are wolves in the land. They would prefer that he didn't tell them where to go or give them traffic tickets or stand at the ready in our airports in camouflage fatigues holding an M-16. The sheep would much rather have the sheepdog cash in his fangs spray paint himself white and go ""baa""--until the wolf shows up. Then the entire flock tries desperately to hide behind one lonely sheepdog.  The students the victims at Columbine High School were big tough high school students and under ordinary circumstances they would not have had the time of day for a police officer. They were not bad kids; they just had nothing to say to a cop. When the school was under attack however and SWAT teams were clearing the rooms and hallways the officers had to physically peel those clinging sobbing kids off of them. This is how the little lambs feel about their sheepdog when the wolf is at the door.  Look at what happened after September 11 2001 when the wolf pounded hard on the door. Remember how America more than ever before felt differently about their law enforcement officers and military personnel? Understand that there is nothing morally superior about being a sheepdog; it is just what you choose to be. Also understand that a sheepdog is a funny critter: He is always sniffing around out on the perimeter checking the breeze barking at things that go bump in the night and yearning for a righteous battle. That is the young sheepdogs yearn for a righteous battle. The old sheepdogs are a little older and wiser but they move to the sound of the guns when needed right along with the young ones.  Here is how the sheep and the sheepdog think differently. The sheep pretend the wolf will never come but the sheepdog lives for that day. After the attacks on September 11 2001 most of the sheep that is most citizens in America said ""Thank God I wasn't on one of those planes."" The sheepdogs the warriors said ""Dear God I wish I could have been on one of those planes. Maybe I could have made a difference."" You want to be able to make a difference. There is nothing morally superior about the sheepdog the warrior but he does have one real advantage. Only one. And that is that he is able to survive and thrive in an environment that destroys 98 percent of the population.  There was research conducted a few years ago with individuals convicted of violent crimes. These cons were in prison for serious predatory crimes of violence: assaults murders and killing law enforcement officers. The vast majority said that they specifically targeted victims by body language: Slumped walk passive behavior and lack of awareness. They chose their victims like big cats do in Africa when they select one out of the herd that is least able to protect itself. Some people may be destined to be sheep and others might be genetically primed to be wolves or sheepdogs. But I believe that most people can choose which one they want to be and I'm proud to say that more and more Americans are choosing to become sheepdogs.  Seven months after the attack on September 11 2001 Todd Beamer was honored in his hometown of Cranbury New Jersey. Todd as you recall was the man on Flight 93 over Pennsylvania who called on his cell phone to alert an operator from United Airlines about the hijacking. When they learned of the other three passenger planes that had been used as weapons Todd and the other passengers confronted the terrorist hijackers. In one hour a transformation occurred among the passengers--athletes business people and parents--from sheep to sheepdogs and together they fought the wolves ultimately saving an unknown number of lives on the ground.  ""There is no safety for honest men except by believing all possible evil of evil men."" - Edmund Burke.  Here is the point I would like to emphasize especially to the thousands of police officers and soldiers I speak to each year. In nature the sheep real sheep are born as sheep. Sheepdogs are born that way and so are wolves. They didn't have a choice. But you are not a critter. As a human being you can be whatever you want to be. It is a conscious moral decision. If you want to be a sheep then you can be a sheep and that is okay but you must understand the price you pay. When the wolf comes you and your loved ones are going to die if there is not a sheepdog there to protect you. If you want to be a wolf you can be one but the sheepdogs are going to hunt you down and you will never have rest safety trust or love. But if you want to be a sheepdog and walk the warrior's path then you must make a conscious and moral decision every day to dedicate equip and prepare yourself to thrive in that toxic corrosive moment when the wolf comes knocking at the door.  This business of being a sheep or a sheep dog is not a yes-no dichotomy. It is not an all-or-nothing either-or choice. It is a matter of degrees a continuum. On one end is an abject head-in-the-sand-sheep and on the other end is the ultimate warrior. Few people exist completely on one end or the other. Most of us live somewhere in between. Immediately after 9-11 almost everyone in America took a step up that continuum away from denial. The sheep took a few steps toward accepting and appreciating their warriors and the warriors started taking their job more seriously. Now the sheep have again begun to despise the sheepdogs as those who represent unending violence and deny the real dangers of the wolves.  Its OK to be a sheep but do not kick the sheep dog. Indeed the sheep dog may just run a little harder strive to protect a little better and be fully prepared to pay an ultimate price in battle and spirit with the sheep moving from ""Baa"" to ""thanks"". We do not call for gifts or freedoms beyond our lot. We just need a small pat on the head a smile and a thank you to fill the emotional tank that is drained protecting the sheep. And when our number is called by ""The Almighty"" and day retreats into night a small prayer before the heavens just may be in order to say thanks for letting you continue to be a sheep. And be grateful for the thousandsmillions--of American sheepdogs who permit you the freedom to express even bad ideas.  Sincerely Charles Grennel --",political,Facebook
Why Its Time to Pass Senate Bill 565 Extreme Risk Protective Orders (Red Flag Law)  In the aftermath of 29 people being shot this past weekend in Dayton Ohio and El Paso Texas President Trump spoke of the need for Red Flag Laws. Senator Lindsey Graham has also echoed his support for such legislation. These laws have been passed in states with Republican legislative majorities. During 2018 I introduced Senate Bill 734 which was a Red Flag Law and this year I introduced Senate Bill 565 which was a Red Flag Law as well. These bills make common sense and they have broad base support across our country. Senate Bill 565 would allow a family member or person who lives in the home of someone who has firearms to obtain a 10-day protective order to allow the guns to be removed from that person if the family member is aware that the person who owns the firearm has threatened to use the weapon against him or herself or others. A law enforcement officer who came upon such information would be able to get a 10-day protective order entered as well. The 10-day order would be reviewed by a District Court Judge who would determine if a valid threat was present. If a judge determined that there was no threat then guns removed from someone would be returned to them however if a judge determined that a threat existed then the firearms could be removed for up to one year.  These types of laws can reduce the probability that someone will use a firearm to hurt themselves or others. This will reduce suicides as well as senseless murders. Its time for the North Carolina Senate to debate and discuss Senate Bill 565 and today I made a plea to Senate leadership for us to take up this bill in the wake of the mass shootings which occurred last weekend. There is a growing concern that this firearms epidemic will never get under control unless we begin to take some positive actions even if theyre small measured steps in the right direction.,political,Facebook

Lisa: So is the door to the cockpit open?  Todd: No the hijackers shut it behind them.  Lisa: Has anyone been injured?  Todd: Yes ..theythey killed one passenger sitting in first class. Theres been lots of shouting. We dont know if the pilots are dead or alive. A flight attendant told me that the pilot and copilot had been forced from the cockpit and may have been wounded.  Lisa: Where is the 3rd hijacker now Todd?  Todd: Hes near the back of the plane. They forced most of the passengers into first class. There are fourteen of us here in the back. Five are flight attendants. He hasnt noticed that I slipped into this pantry to get the phone. The guy with the bomb ordered us to sit on the floor in the rear of the plane.oh Jesus.. Help!

I understand you have a hijacking situation?  Lisa: Yes sir Ive been talking with a passenger a Todd Beamer on Flight 93 who managed to get to an air phone unnoticed.  Goodwin: Where did this flight originate and what was its destination?  Lisa: The flight left Newark New Jersey at 8 A.M. departing for San Francisco.

Jeremy called his wife again on his cell phone. She told him more about the World Trade Center and all.  Goodwin: Hello Todd. This is Agent Goodwin with the FBI. We have been monitoring your flight. Your plane is on a course for Washington DC. These terrorists sent two planes into the World Trade Center and one plane into the Pentagon.

Lisa: Mr. Goodwin how much time do they have before they get to Washington?  Goodwin: Not long maam. They changed course over Cleveland; theyre approaching Pittsburgh now. Washington may be twenty minutes away.  Todd: (breathing a little heavier) The plane seems to be changing directions just a little. Its getting pretty rough up here. The plane is flying real erratic.Were not going to make it out of here. Listen to me.I want you to hear this.I have talked with the others.we have decided we would not be pawns in these hijackers suicidal plot.  Lisa: Todd what are you going to do?  Todd: Weve hatched a plan. Four of us are going to rush the hijacker with the bomb. After we take him out well break into the cockpit. A stewardess is getting some boiling water to throw on the hijackers at the controls. Well get them.and well take them out. Lisa ..will you do one last thing for me?  Lisa: YesWhat is it?  Todd: Would you pray with me?  They pray: Our father which art in Heaven  Hallowed be thy name  Thy kingdom come thy will be done  on earth as it is in heaven.  Give us this day our daily bread  And forgive us our trespasses  As we forgive our trespassers  And lead us not into temptation  But deliver us from evil  For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory  Forever..Amen  The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want  He makes me to lie down in green pastures  He leads me beside the still waters  He restores my soul  He leads me in paths of righteousness  for His names sake  Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death  I will fear no evil for thou art with me..

It's been a difficult election so far you know but I think I have a chance. We'll see. So I'm doing Facebook Ads now where you can't respond but boosted posts like this one you can. So let's discuss the issues and even the candidates but if you're mean or stupid I'm just going to block you and what good will that do anyone? Will it really make you feel better? So here are some issues (4): Freezing property taxes for seniors and others on fixed incomes. Requiring Ombudspersons in nursing homes and assisted living facilities reporting to the state but paid for by the facilities to make sure our loved ones aren't abused and cared for well. Freezing evictions during Corona unemployment. Changing state law to allow St. Louis to require lock-boxes for guns in cars where many guns used in crimes are stolen from. for more.,political,Facebook
The progressive far left has targeted Senate District 6.  No more complacency. These hardcore community organizers want to do for us what theyve done for California!  The conservative values we cherish are threatened by those representing the party of infanticide a borderless America and socialism. And dont forget all those bike lanes.  While Im in Columbia fighting for you these uber-liberals are name-calling and challenging my views on yes bike lanes.  Really! Im worried about their hunger for late-term and post birth abortions their desire to take your guns and voracious thirst for more taxes.  Say a resounding No to creeping Venezuela!

Once Upon a Time in America - Charlie's Soapbox 2/15/19  All it takes is a look at the U.S. Congress to see how seriously fractured our nation is.  Bernie Sanders no longer has the dubious pleasure of being the only openly socialist member as he has been joined by most notably and loudly - thanks to the media - Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who has kicked socialism up several notches to resemble what took Venezuela down the drain in a few short years.  The acceptance of socialism mostly by the younger voters can be blamed to a big degree on their education especially at the college level where pseudo revolutionists from the flower child generation teach the nobility of socialism making it sound like a place of social nirvana where everybody shares and shares alike where people are rewarded according to not their production but simply by virtue of being born.  Shortly after the fall of the iron curtain when American businesses rushed into the Eastern Bloc countries to reap the benefits of the fledgling democracies that McDonalds had set up shop in and the people scrambled to get the jobs they offered at better wages than they had ever seen.  Then the problems began because the workers they hired came in worked a short while and tried to spend the rest of the day just sitting around reading the newspaper or whatever work be damned.  The truth of the matter is that they simply didnt know any better the work ethic had been so thoroughly burned out of them by the socialistic theory that no matter how hard you work youll never advance and you wont make any more money so going to work to them meant sluffing off all day.  Reportedly there was also a high rate of employee turnover.  The apologists leave out the parts about how for socialism to exist there eventually has to be a totalitarian government to enforce it after the few who dare to excel start looking at the slugs and wondering why they deserve the same pay and benefits as one who brings something to the job and actually produces for their pay.  These people have to be kept quiet lest they upset the apple cart and start a movement that could turn political and topple the elite who sit at the top of the pyramid and live like royalty.  To start with a little harassment and public scorn is enough but after a while it eventually takes a midnight knock on the door and a person never being heard from again and a little bit of this goes a long way in toning down the dissenters.  When governments start nationalizing private businesses the bureaucracies explode and since they have to justify their existence they begin levying regulations that tie the hands of commerce and make it next to impossible to show a profit.  Which doesnt bother government at all since they have a never-ending source of income and when they need more money they simply raise taxes or print it.  Eventually both their sources are pushed to the bursting point when taxes cant possibly be raised anymore and as a result of printing money hyperinflation sets in and it takes a dump truck full of cash to buy the weeks groceries and no nation is willing to lend more money and the panic begins.  There is no food on the shelves gasoline is totally unaffordable even if you can find it then factories and manufacturing shuts down the government is stone broke the dole is discontinued the power struggles begin which means that even the meager amount of currency that can be had goes for guns not butter and the people resort to whatever they have to to eat - up to and including slaughtering the animals at the zoo.  Everywhere socialism has been tried it has miserably failed reducing the quality of life destroying governments and leaving economies in shreds.  Yet there is always a new gaggle of fools who think they can make it work or at least thats what they tell the electorate always masking their real intentions of having suffocating and perpetual power over a nation.  America sets on the edge of the precipice the next couple of elections will decide whether we pull back or go over the side.  What do you think?  Pray for our troops our police and the peace of Jerusalem.  God Bless America  Charlie Daniels,political,Facebook
"Please send letters like ours to Virginia Democrat Delegates & Senators. Please like & Share on FB & Twitter. Please also visit our website for ALL Virginia Representatives contact information and to register to vote. Democrat ideology is flawed communist and unconstitutional. Here are the REAL facts. Let me explain. Please do NOT pass any additional firearm ban laws. Simply enforce ALL the laws that are already in effect and solve REAL problems in our state. We do NOT have a firearm problem. We have a broken family problem. 75% of black families are broken and fatherless. 83% of the prison population in Virginia is minority. The majority of gun crime is black on black in only a few cities. Yet only 13% of Americans are black. We have a mental health crisis in America. 60% of firearm deaths are suicide. There are 70000 opioid deaths per year; 3-times the rate of firearm suicides. Yet in Virginia there is legislation to ban AK-47s & AR-15s which are semi-automatic rifles and fire at the same rate as semi-automatic handguns. You might be surprised to hear that there were only 30 rifle homicides in Virginia last year; this includes the AR & AK assault rifle. There is NO such thing as an assault rifle. There is NO difference between an assault rifle and any other firearm except they look scarier. All firearms once fired at someone constitute the crime of assault. Another interesting fact based on population rate Illegal aliens commit half the firearm homicides. The US population is about 320 million with illegal aliens making up 10% of the population (30 million) and committing 10% of all firearm homicides. Therefore illegal aliens commit half the firearm homicides on a population rate basis. Now that we put things into proper context with the previous facts. Please do not legislate any further gun laws. Please also take into consideration the following additional facts that also do NOT support more gun control laws. All the facts demonstrate the need to lessen gun restrictions for law abiding individuals and eliminate gun free zones so innocent people can protect themselves and others. Good people with guns are NOT the problem. Good people with guns are needed for protection from bad people with guns based on our US Constitution. Our US & Virginia Constitutions State Code & Supreme Court say ""..right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed."" ; military should be governed by civil power.  militia shall consist of all able-bodied residents of Virginia who are citizens of the United States. Thats us. There are 8.5 million Virginians. 2.8 million people of ALL political parties own firearms. Majority of homes have firearms. Of the 60000 Deaths In Virginia last year ONLY 340 were firearm homicides ZERO in my James City County. The Virginia firearm homicide rate is ONLY .004%. You have a better chance of getting struck by lightning than murdered with a gun. Virginia has the 4th lowest violent crime rate in the nation because un-infringed gun ownership is a deterrent. Virginia doesnt have a firearm problem. Dangerous cities have a firearm-ban problem. Radical special interest groups falsely blame gun violence on law abiding Citizens in order to disguise their agenda of power money & control. In the US Annually gun owners prevent 2.5 million crimes. 90% of gun crime takes place in gun free zones. Criminals dont follow laws. If gun rights are taken away Virginians cant defend themselves. State Representatives you have a duty & took an oath to uphold our Constitution. Since law enforcement does NOT have a duty to protect Virginians and government CANNOT guarantee our protection please do not do anything to infringe on Virginians rights to protect themselves with any semi-automatic weapon they choose to be best for them. Over 95% of Virginia jurisdictions have already committed to protecting the 2nd Amendment with 2nd Amendment Sanctuary and Constitution Resolutions. These 2nd Amendment Resolutions are endorsed by many Sheriffs and their willingness to deputize citizens in order to fulfill their oaths to the same Constitution guaranteeing that the right to bear arms SHALL NOT be infringed; so citizens can protect themselves and assist law enforcement by deterring or preventing crime. This action sends a resounding message to lawmakers to preserve our Constitutional Rights and keep Virginia safe & secure. If you choose not to follow the law and the will of the people you will be wasting ALL of your legislative time and your Virginia budget will be tied up in court battles for the next two years until you are NOT re-elected. If you would like to debate these facts I am available any time for a non-emotional sensible factual discussion.",political,Facebook
"WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE A CHRISTIAN TODAY?  We live in a very divided environment. Each day we see stories about abortion while at the same time seeing stories about people being tried in the courts for abusing an animal. We see stories about sky rocketing incidents or murder with guns. The guns are generally vilified while the people using the guns are given a pass. We see stories about tax free status for Christians being denied because Christians are generally Republicans. We see stories about all members of the white race being condemned as racists while on the other hand black lives matter. We see stories portraying our nation the United States of America as an outgrowth of slavery rather than as a continuing search for liberty and freedom. Our nation is described as a flawed and terrible place rather than an imperfect ideal searching for greater and greater perfection. Christians are under greater siege now than at any time in the past 100 years.  As these things continue to occur I feel that those who follow Jesus Christ thus who believe that he is the Son of God and the gate on the path to eternal life are being treated as members of a cult where each member believes in an invisible fantasy in a comic book story in a fictional concoction with no real meaning. I also believe there are real reasons Christians are portrayed in this manner.  First many many churches contribute to this fantasy. With their beautiful buildings and symbols with their order and structure with their entertaining music and continuous social activities; with the Sunday School classes and fellowship meetings with the meals and the yard sales with the choruses and bands with the internal networking churches provide a structure that makes both members and guests feel wanted feel cared for feel like they are joining something important. Sometimes this is true. Sometimes it is a facade; a lie.  Christians believers in Jesus Christ are not club members who can be a little bit in or half-way in. Christians are all the way in. They believe in Jesus Christ. They develop their lives around faith in Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ dictates their actions and their thoughts. This is not to say believers are perfect or even nearly perfect. As hard as they try to live as Christ lived they fall short. All members of mankind are sinners; we all fall short. During these trying times it isn't just individual Christians who fall short: it is the Church as an institution that is falling short.  In the United States of America two parts; the establishment clause and the free exercise clause of the First Amendment of the Constitution guarantee that the government will not and can not interfere with the free exercise of religion. However over the past eighteen months churches in mass have kowtowed to the government shuttered their doors locked out their congregations and failed to carry out even the most oft quoted command of our God ""Fear Not."" They have willingly given up their freedom under the Constitution and failed to obey God. This surrender of autonomy this abdication of authority has totally undermined the importance of organized religion in our country. Instead of acting independently to go forward in their collective trust in the sanctity and authority of Jesus Christ they have surrendered to fear. Instead of moving forward with their activities while at the same time presenting alternatives to those who did fear the churches closed their doors and became social media platforms; just another source of information. Organized churches stripped off the armor of God and bared themselves to the assaults of heathens.  At the same time they were giving away their power and authority the churches failed to take firm stands against sins clearly enunciated in the Bible. They failed to take a stand within the constraints of the Word of God. Thousands of churches condone and accept abortion of children. Thousands of additional churches accept the leadership of those bragging about and consistently seeking deviant life styles; lives as homosexuals or lesbians; lives as bisexuals; lives during which they surgically change the characteristics of their biological gender or lifestyles during which they claim to be of a different gender or of no gender. They celebrate their ""pride"" in their deviance. Though the church is entrusted to accept these behaviors; after all they are simply different sins from stealing lying cheating worshipping idols etc.; the church should always accept these behaviors with the grace and tolerance of knowing that those who believe will seek to minimize to eliminate the frequency of their sinning; that they will strive to achieve a more sin free life. Many many churches are failing to accomplish even that. Additional churches are accepting of these behaviors to the point of putting those who practice this behavior into leadership positions. Satan leading the flock. How appropriate in this evil society in which we live.  Of even greater import to those who attend traditional churches should be the lack of outreach the failure to carry out the instructions of Jesus Christ to love our neighbors to treat our neighbors as ourselves to help others. Many churches have little or not outreach few or no ministries designed to help those around them. Tens of thousands of churches do little more than maintain the building in which they meet and pay those tasked with instructing them in the ways of Jesus Christ. If it were not so sad it would be almost humorous that three average guys have met every week face to face in the homes of one another each Sunday fixed a breakfast each week engaged in fellowship conducted a sermon or class every seven days periodically offered Communion developed a website and a local presence and conduct many many ministries within our community. Not only do we build the occasional ramp for the handicapped provide food boxes to elderly Jews support Angel Tree programs for many children assist with the care of the homeless send the children of incarcerated men and women to summer camps but are also active in assisting other ministries to obtain and build busses for use during emergencies support Kairos to visit and minister to those incarcerated participate in the multi-denominational men's group in Northeaster North Carolina but also support Emmaus to provide more intensive support to practicing Christians. To be blunt we are not scared have not been scared and have blatantly disobeyed the governments attempts to control us. Furthermore as a group we have been chastised by other Christians for our beliefs and our actions.  Jesus Christ did not have an easy life. Being a man is not easy. Following Jesus Christ is not easy and it was never intended to be so. If you are going to proclaim yourself to be a Christian it is time to open your hearts attempt to discern what God is telling you to do put on your big-boy pants and start doing your jobs. Though Jesus Christ never coined ""The Great Commission"" he did tell us to make disciples of all nations and to baptize them. Go out and do it. Do not allow others to tell you that you are wrong and can not do it. GO OUT AND DO! Being a Christian is being in action.",political,Facebook
America pay close attention to what is going on in this country since the election of President Trump it has become clear that the Socialist Democrats have a strategy to manipulate and corrupt our election process and our laws so they will win every election. We can depend on Democrats for competency in one thing making your state and city a shithole and they are damn good at it! Dont take my word for it read legitimate sources listen to what they say and the picture will become very clear to you. Here is the dangerous Socialist Democrats agenda and all the evidence is right in front of your eyes: We see Democrats not accepting election results all over the country and contriving conspiracy theories that these elections were unfair or fraudulent. Democrats are trying to take down a duly elected President Trump with lies and a salacious unverified dossier because they lost an election to Trump. We have seen Americans being attacked and beaten up by violent democrats just because they support our duly elected President Mr. Trump or wear a MAGA hat. We see anti-Semitic Democrats elected to Congress. The Democrat's plan is to alter the election process so that the popular vote will elect the President instead of the electoral vote. This is just a manipulation of the election process to ensure that New York Oregon Washington State Illinois NJ California will dictate who our President will be and middle America will be virtually cut out of the election process. They want to add the number of justices to the Supreme Court quickly while they are in power and to make sure they are also Socialist Democrats thereby overwhelmingly tipping the power of the court to the socialists. They will abolish the 2nd amendment and Americans rights to own guns and protect themselves from a tyrannical government and criminals. Since Obama was President we have seen the Democrats declare war on the Police and Law and Order and they have embraced criminals and lying hate groups like the Black Lives Matter the Southern Poverty Law Center Farrakhan and Al Sharpton. Democrats release violent criminals back on our streets and have turned criminals into victims. They make sure that the public-school systems in the inner cities keep our children uneducated which leads them to the pathway of unemployment or crime. Their new plan to legalize marijuana will create generations of lazy drug addicted children that will become useless when they become adults and dependent on the government. The mainstream media have become complicit in disseminating false information with the Democrats and are supporting the Socialist agenda. Reduce the voting age to 16 the majority will be public school children that are indoctrinated in these schools into believing and supporting a Socialist democratic ideology thereby turning them into Democrat voters. We have Democrats who are presidential candidates supporting a socialist agenda; our forefathers would be spinning in their graves. Democrats have destroyed what use to be beautiful and prosperous cities and states within our country like Chicago Detroit California and scores of others. Therefore the 2020 election is critical if the Socialist Democrats win the White House and take both houses in Congress we will see a change in this country that will most likely cause a civil war. Democrats believe that middle America is stupid and that they must comply with their ideology and if not they will be dealt with accordingly. Their open border plans will create an even bigger wave then we see today of illegal immigrants coming to our country in the tens of millions and the Socialist Democrats will give them the right to vote in federal elections which will overwhelmingly give them the popular vote because of promises of free money healthcare education and shelter. This will create such a financial burden for our country that taxes will be increased as we have never seen them before putting the weight on those in middle America and the middle class who will no longer have a say in government just so Socialist Democrats can stay in power. The new socialist supreme court will then put limitations on free speech meaning that everything is hate speech if you dont agree with the new socialist government where have we seen this before! The Democrats ideology will turn the whole country into California Seattle and Chicago if we let them. We have all the evidence we require proving that the Democrats are incompetent and care only about their power and their lunatic ideology. All this will erode the United States of America while China Iran NK and Russian leaders sit back and say to themselves we couldnt have planned this better ourselves Pres. Ronald Regan once said if Fascism ever comes to America it will come in the form of liberalism. Well America it's happening and we still have the power to stop it however for this to happen Americans cannot sit around complaining you must get involved and join political groups that will support and defend our constitution. We no longer can depend on many in the Republican Party because they have sat by and surrendered to the Democrats and let us get to the place we are today fighting for our American way of life. Its our country America and if we dont want to see it destroyed we must all get involved the lives of our children and our great country depends on it!

I had a constituent meeting today at a local restaurant. The topic was gun control regulations. He is an avid gun owner a republican an ex marine and gun sports enthusiast. He has several guns. I am delighted to report that we had an animated and respectful two hour conversation about various aspects of the subject of gun regulations. While we didnt agree on everything we do find agreement on a number of things that seem to make sense. 1- licensure for everyone with a gun that has mandatory training as its core 2- gun safes 3- three or seven day waiting period for all first time gun owners 4- prohibition of gun ownership for any convicted of abuse crimes (wife children or animals) Thank you to this gentleman for taking his time to speak with me at such length and with respect.,political,Facebook
"LIBERTARIANISM AND ""FREEDOM""  Recently I read an article by libertarian writer Chris Rossini entitled ""Avoiding the 'God-Complex' Trap"". It was published in the ""Ron Paul Liberty Report"". Ron Paul is kind-of the present day grandfather of U.S. libertarian thought. He is a former U.S. Representative from Texas and the father of Kentucky U.S. Senator Rand Paul another highly recognized libertarian voice.  A notable strength in Rossini's argument lies in his emphasis that beliefs precede actions. This is an idea often discussed on this Page that ideological or spiritual transformation is necessary before real change can occur. Without a change in beliefs the imposition of an ideology will amount to a fascist undertaking or in Rossini's words ""creeping totalitarianism"". He exhorts his readers to not weary in their quest for a libertarian world and to not get discouraged that immediate change is not forthcoming because beliefs have to change before real change is possible. Accordingly the mission of the libertarian is to convince people of the libertarian way.  While I know very little about Rossini's full set of beliefs--libertarianism like any ideology is as nuanced as the people who think about the topic--it is the general libertarian belief that government beyond a very minimal level represents a drift towards totalitarianism. This is where the libertarian argument falls apart.  Libertarianism started-out as a liberal anti-state socialism and anti-capitalist movement. It took a free market pro-capitalism direction in the U.S. during the 1950-1960's. Today U.S. libertarianism is best described as liberal on social issues and conservative on economic issues although liberal in the classical sense of the term. It is hard not to be attracted to the libertarian message. Most of us want freedom from social restraint freedom to develop our individual selves freedom from government oversight: all characteristics of U.S. libertarian thought.  The problem unfortunately is one person's freedom is often another's restraint. Libertarians believe people should be free to do as they please so long as they don't hurt anyone else. Most of us undoubtedly agree with this belief. Where the libertarians fall short however is in the recognition of when others get hurt. Drive through any old industrial midwestern city and you will see the scars imposed on communities by free individuals who freely made economic decisions which destroyed these communities. That is libertarianism. These freely made economic decisions resulted in massive disinvestment caused mass wage reduction unemployment poverty abandonment lost property values inspired crime sent people to prison and drove up the cost of government. Are we to feel good about this because actors at the top of industry freely chose this path?  Wall Streeters may want to operate with a degree of leverage which far exceeds that appropriate for the safety and soundness of the financial system. But when it all implodes it is the little guy who ends up living in a tent under an urban bridge perhaps at risk of losing his or her family. There is no freedom there and people get hurt. A person's freedom to bear arms will inevitably result in a troubled person's ability to attain such arms who may then engage in mass slaughter. Personal freedom to own guns has resulted in another's lost freedom to live. Freedom to appear maskless in public during the global health pandemic has undoubtedly cost people their lives. Again one person's freedom has caused another's loss of freedom. One person's freedom to build a house on a picturesque lake shore oppresses another's freedom to view nature untarnished by human hands: freedom lost. Turns out libertarianism views freedom through a very self-interested lens.  Even the premises of the capitalist model the preferred model of libertarians oppress those who disagree with its premises. The capitalist beast having spread its tentacles throughout most of the globe consuming most of what lies in its path imposes a set values on those communities through which it journeys: competition greed and lust for material consumption. For most some level of adoption of these values is necessary for survival in the capitalist context. This is an oppressive situation imposed by libertarians thinkers on those who reject such values.  Rossini believes we are drifting towards totalitarianism. A definition of totalitarianism is : ""a system of government that is centralized and dictatorial and requires complete subservience to the state."" Has not capitalism become a form of ""centralized"" governing which requires a good deal of ""subservience to the state."": ""state"" herein defined as the state-corporate-ideological apparatus which runs our lives. It is difficult to distinguish between the drift towards the totalitarianism of capitalism vs. the drift towards the totalitarianism of socialism. Both drifts are diminished to the extent that either ideology is embraced by a majority of the population. Then of course the argument becomes that the minority of voters who hold different views are tyrannized by the majority. But is there a better way?  The Constitution's Bill of Rights offers some protection against the tyranny of the majority but only to the extent that a majority of U.S. Supreme Court Justices agree to offer this protection. Again underlying ideological beliefs are crucial even to the level of protections offered by the Bill of Rights. Neither ideological system of course needs to be fully totalitarian but any system and libertarianism is inevitably a system will place limits on individual behavior.  The above discussion of urban economic disinvestment is private sector totalitarianism it is the totalitarianism of capital. We can attempt through government to control the flow of capital to free those oppressed by private capital but then we socialist exercise a degree of totalitarianism towards capital. So is it freedom of capital or freedom of those oppressed by capital which we seek to achieve? Either answer will result in someone's loss of freedom.  Many who engage this Page believe in socialism. But what does that mean? Each of our heads contains a unique vision of a socialist world: it is a highly nuanced term. Broadly speaking for most of us socialism is a path to freedom for the broad mass of humanity. It ensures an equitable distribution of goods and services globally not determined by misrepresentative market values which fail to fully encapsulate the cost of production but by human need and contributed work effort. It is a cooperative world which rejects poverty and war; its economic structure is variable but determined by a fundamental quest to achieve a decent material life for all people which in turn enables full individual development i.e. freedom.  How is this freedom different from the freedom sought by libertarians? Libertarians believe individuals acting in their individual interests can achieve the greatest freedom for all people. Socialist see the flaw in this thinking. We are connected. At times our decisions will limit the freedoms of others. This is the nature of a body in this case the body humanity. The human palate provides the enjoyment of taste but unbridled consumption in the quest to satisfy the palate will certainly have negative consequences for the rest of the body; likewise individual indulgences can harmfully impact others in the broader community.  How are we to decide on policies which maximize the freedom of a society? Through the vote informed by the knowledge that one person's freedom is often another's oppression and not informed through a misguided belief that extreme individual freedom will make us more free. Freedom must be viewed through the communal lens with careful attention paid to various harmful consequences that are often imposed on the broader community by individual action. Where individual actions do not impose harm on others then of course freedom should exist.",political,Facebook
Lets try to have an adult conversation about gun control if that is possible. First lets be honest mass killings are just a part actually a small part of the problem of gun violence. Many more people die every year by guns then just by mass shootings. I do think we need to stop all the rhetoric scare tactics and extremism on both sides. (Before I start I am not a gun expert so if my terminology is off I apologize now) First off lets be honest with our selves America will never ban all guns. There is no will among politicians or the people for a complete ban and their are already too many legal and illegal guns out there to ever completely ban. SO lets all admit a complete ban is off the table. I believe the vast majority of Americans have no issue with legal handguns hunting rifles and shotguns. Do we agree? On the other hand I think most reasonable people agree everyday people should not be allowed to own fully automatic machine guns bazookas rocket propelled grenades any grenade bombs missiles tanks fighter jets aircraft carriers etc etc. You get my point. So basically that means the only argument comes down to semi automatic long guns (Assault rifles etc.). Personally I believe these types of weapons should be banned for a couple of reasons. First I thin these weapons are good for one thing only  and that is killing human beings. Second by taking them off the streets it makes our police safer. Lastly they are the weapon of choice of mass shooters. That being said I dont think the right will ever go for a ban. Therefore I would suggest for these types of weapons a special license should be required that would require a exam psych evaluation enhanced background check and weapon registration. Any valid gun owner should have no issue with this. If you do you probably want your guns for another nefarious reason. That being said to me there are other things we should do to cut down on gun violence and on the lethality of guns. 1) There should be a limit on the amount of ammo you can buy 2) So called cop killer bullets should be outlawed 3) Extended magazines should be outlawed 4) Gun manufacturers should be required to have finger print unlock on all weapons 5) The selling of conversion kits should be illegal 6) Greatly increase the amount of money for the ATF to track down illegal weapons. I would suggest by cutting down on how much we spend to prosecute and imprison minor drug crimes 7) Create gun buy back programs Here in Orlando there has been a very successful program started by a local radio program that over the past 15 years has got thousands of guns turned in including one year a TOW missile launcher. 8) Increase red flag programs. Research has shown they work. 9) Close the background check loop hole 10) Make parents responsible for crimes committed by children using their gun. 11) Develop a national database for background checks. Police Departments health care professionals and Justice systems should be held criminally responsible if not updated timely Lastly and a big one. To assure the 2nd Amendment people. Work towards a Constitutional Amendment that clarifies the 2nd Amendment to state that you have the right to own guns for self protection of yourself your loved ones and your property That's what I got folks. I know as they say the devil is in the details however this my basis to start. I think everything here is the basis to begin to put together comprehensive gun control plan to make Americans safer without infringing on the their rights.,political,Facebook
If Americans ever understand the threat a third party has to the status quo we would have a lot more people voting for them. The reason the Ds and Rs try so hard to keep third parties silenced and out of races is not a matter of trying to keep people from having an option as it would take away the biggest bullet in their guns.  Both parties have switched gears now days from trying to make you like them enough to vote for them to trying to demonize the other party enough for you to vote against the other party. By default that forces you to vote for their party or just depress the vote. If a third party became a viable option they can no longer count on you to vote for them when you vote against the other party. That scares them it lessens their control.  We see this fearmongering every day from both parties. From the right it is stuff like if the Ds win they will take your guns or take your jobs by giving them to illegals. From the left it is if you vote Rs it means you are racist or want to keep the poor man down it is making you the target of cancel culture.  You want the hate to stop? Vote third party take their power away and make them earn your vote.  To support my thoughts this is the amount spent in my district for the MN-07 US Congressional seat (full disclosure I am running for this seat in 2022). As you can see the amount spent attacking is almost double what was spent supporting to include the candidates own campaign contribution. That is a lot more money spent on being against someone than for their candidate.  Source is from  $5447513 spent by both campaigns combined Outside money spent: $ 14141 493. $13035283 of which is from PACs directly connected to either party or their leadership. Money spent from outside sources in support of candidate or party $1144628 Money spent from outside sources against a candidate or party $12996865  Just something to think about. When you are thinking about it also consider how often in the last two presidential elections you heard that a vote for the third party was a vote for one parties opponent? Where do you think those talking points came from? #unleashthebullondc #runningofthebullinmn7,political,Facebook

"Yahoo.- Fox News host Neil Cavuto took the President to task on Thursday when responding to Trump's criticism of the network. it was the President's tweet from Wednesday in which he declared ""fox isn't working for us!"" that prompted Cavuto's response. ""First of all Mr. President we don't work for you. I don't work for you. My job is to cover you not fawn over you or rip you just report on you to call balls and strikes on you. My job Mr. President our job here is to keep the score not settle scores"" said Cavuto in response to the tweet. Cavuto said Trump isn't a fan of negative press or anyone questioning him. Cavuto explained ""You are the President; It comes with the job. Just like checking what you say and do comes with my job"" Cavuto checked Trump by pointing out multiple examples of the President's own misinformation and false claims. ""I'm not the one who said tariffs are a wonderful thing; you are. I'm not the one that said Mexico would pay for the wall; you did. Just like I'm not the one who claimed Russia didn't meddle in the 2016 election; you did"" said the Fox News host. Cavuto continued reading off false claims made by Trump like when he denied paying off Stormy Daniels; he said the Access Hollywood tape was fake; he claimed that he inherited a depression from Obama; and his recent reversal on background checks for guns within hours. ""These aren't fake items. They are real items and you really said to them"" said Cavuto adding ""Fake is when it's wrong Mr. President not when it's unpleasant."" In the end Cavuto acknowledged that the media isn't always fair to the President but that doesn't mean he's entitled to his own facts or special treatment. ""Hard as it is to fathom Mr. President just because you're the leader of the free world doesn't entitle you to a free pass. Unfortunately just a free press"" Cavuto said in closing. Free Press.

"Guns and Autos: Explaining the Problems of Many Gun Control Proposals by Matt Carden  There are ""constants"" in the Universe.  Gravity is a ""constant"" in the universe. The speed of light is a ""constant"" in the universe. Unfortunately ""Knee-Jerk Reaction"" gun control proposals and arguments after a mass shooting event are also ""constants."" Within the scope of ""Knee-Jerk Reaction"" gun control proposals there are other ""constants"" as well. One of those ""constants"" is that eventually someone will argue ""we make people get licenses and insurance for cars why shouldn't we make people get a license and liability insurance before they can own a gun?""  The fact is the vast majority of those that push for increased gun control have no idea of what current laws already exist the extent of those laws or how they apply to gun ownership or what the process is for purchasing a firearm. A number of those that are ""pro-gun control"" believe that anyone can go to a store and buy ""fully automatic"" firearms over the counter or that one can go to a website pick out a gun type in their credit card number and the gun will just be mailed to them. Many gun control advocates give the impression that a gun show is a ""free-for-all"" full of individuals who could never pass a federal firearm background check and intend to go on a shooting rampage the moment they leave the show. If one listens to some gun-control advocates gun shows exist solely to provide a location to avoid back-ground checks for firearm purchases.  Sadly there are a great many people who listen to these ""pro-gun control"" advocates despite the fact that many of those who are ""pro-gun control"" have limited knowledge of guns at best. The public hear phrases like ""background checks"" ""keep military weapons out of civilian hands"" or ""assault weapons ban"" and cannot help but think the proposals are reasonable.  Perhaps the best way to show why some of these proposals are unreasonable is to compare guns and automobiles. Let's take current gun control proposals and laws and see what they look like when applied to automobile ownership operation and licensing:  1. We must ban all Jeeps and Hummers- they have a military appearance and we can't have that. A military appearance makes things more dangerous. Suburbans and other quasi-military looking vehicles also should be restricted.  Firearms reality: Many so called ""assault weapons bans"" restrict the sale and ownership of a firearm simply because of the ""looks"" of the gun. These laws may ban one firearm but say another is a ""common hunting firearm"" and therefore permissible to own in the view of some gun control advocates. This despite the fact that both of the firearms use the same caliber of round (bullets) and both are semi-automatic. It should not be a valid reason to ban a firearm because it ""looks scary""  2. All vehicles must be limited to a tank quantity of less than 10 gallons. That way you can't drive as much. You must stop to reload (the tank) more often.  Firearms reality: A constant proposal from gun control advocates is limiting the size of firearm magazines (incorrectly often referred to as ""clips""). If I am in a situation where I have to use my firearm to defend my life or the life of another I don't want to run out of ammunition (personally I am a decent shot so I might not run out of ammo but there may be others who don't shoot as well). Another reason why a person may wish to have a high-capacity magazine may be that a person might not want to spend all their time at the shooting range re-loading. The ""gun-control advocate"" view is that no one needs more than eight to ten rounds of ammo. That view is false.  3. We must place an breathalyzer interlock on ALL cars and trucks- regardless of whether the person had ever had a DUI- they might try sometime even if they NEVER drink.  Firearms reality: I have lost track of the number of times when a certain firearm is used in a crime and ""gun-control advocates"" immediately want to ban everyone from having that type firearm. The criminal actions of a single individual should never dictate the rights of millions of law abiding citizens.  4. All states should adopt ""MAY ISSUE"" laws instead of SHALL ISSUE. It should be up to the whim of local sheriffs to decide who gets to drive and who doesn't. With the Shall Issue law if a person passes the Drivers License test and has a clean record the state MUST issue a drivers license. Obviously this is bad.  Firearms reality: There are nine states with either strict or partial ""may issue"" concealed weapons permit laws. The most egregious jurisdiction in the eyes of many is San Diego County. It is nearly impossible to obtain a concealed weapons permit in San Diego County. The San Diego County Sheriff's website states that to obtain a Concealed Carry Weapon Permit you must demonstrate ""a set of circumstances that distinguishes the applicant from other members of the general public and causes him or her to be placed in harms way. Simply writing ""self defense"" or ""personal protection"" on an application does not provide the requisite proof of good cause."" Other jurisdictions such as the District of Columbia have been told by the United States Court of Appeals that a nearly identical ""good cause"" requirement is unconstitutional. This issue has yet to be heard by the United States Supreme Court. Rulings from the Court of Appeals only apply to those places where the individual court has jurisdiction.  5. One state should not be required to accept another's Drivers License. Places like New York California DC etc should be allowed to ban drivers from other states from driving in their states. To hell with the fact that the Supreme Court has ruled that interstate travel is a right.  Firearms reality: Although most states accept the Concealed Carry permit of other states places like California do not. In fact because California does not allow for the open carry of firearms and in California only a California resident may obtain a Concealed Carry permit it is in effect illegal for a non-resident to carry a firearm. The general belief of the public is the Constitution guarantees the right to keep and bear arms. The United States Supreme Court has never ruled on this issue. Therefore for now at least in California the Second Amendment does not apply to those who are from any of the other 49 states.  6. All automobile purchasers should be required to have a background check-- UNIVERSAL Background Checks- even in the case of someone being willed grandfather's old car. The person buying could have a background of speeding or DUI  Firearms reality: Every firearms sale through a firearms dealer requires a background check by Federal law. The information from the purchaser is run through NICS (National Instant Criminal Background Check System). This also includes sales from dealers at gun shows as well as so called internet sales. The fact is ""internet sales"" don't really happen. A person may go to a website such as to purchase a firearm but the firearm does not go to the purchaser directly. The firearm gets transferred to a licensed firearm dealer. That dealer then performs all required background checks as will as any required state checks. This also is a check against violation of state law in that if the firearm is illegal in the state of purchase the transfer to the purchaser does not take place. The gun control lobby seeks to expand background checks past this point. Under the ""pro-gun control"" proposals if I were to purchase a firearm as a gift for my spouse (I have done this on several occasions and the ""gift"" is greatly appreciated) not only would a background check be performed on me as the purchaser but then my spouse would have to go to the store and have a background check run as well. This is an inconvenience with little gain. Background checks do not stop crime. Criminals generally do not go to gun stores to purchase a gun before committing a crime- they get those guns on the street or by theft.  7. Ban the private sale or transfer of autos and all internet sales. The person buying the car MUST have a background check. This includes all ""car shows"" - OK so even though all car dealers at car shows may be licensed dealers AND they would already do a background check who cares. You can buy parts at shows and that means a bad driver ""could"" get a hold of a car at a show.  Firearms reality: There are proposals to ban the private ""transfer"" of firearms. This would include firearms transferred by Will and Testament. As already discussed these type checks do nothing to stop crime. These checks are about tracking who owns what guns.  8. Require a background check for the purchase of gasoline at the state level. Allow for an ""instant check"" for those who have bought a car in the last year (will help speed up gasoline sales). However individuals who have not purchased a car in the last year will have to wait until they are ""in the system"" before a gasoline purchase can be approved. Additionally out of state visitors will be unable to purchase gasoline.  Firearms reality: California has recently enacted a background check requirement ammunition purchases. The only persons approved immediately are those who have purchased a firearm since the state started tracking purchases. The state wants to be sure you only buy ammunition for a gun you personally own. If you haven't made a recent firearm purchase you must wait for processing to be completed on your application before the state will approve your ammunition purchase. If you are not a California resident you would not have a firearm purchase registered with the California system and therefore you would not be able to purchase ammunition. For those who believe that people from outside of California would have no need to purchase ammunition there are people who travel to California to compete in shooting competitions. There are also those who travel to California to hunt. Regardless of the reason these restrictions are unreasonable and have been challenged in Federal Court. To date this law has yet to be reviewed by any court higher than Federal District Court- however the Federal Judge has stated he believes these laws will be found to be unconstitutional but there currently is no injunction in place and the ammo purchase laws are in effect.  9. We must limit AAA. The problem is they are to powerful. EVERY TIME a multiple vehicle accident occurs it is because of their members and the lobbying power they have. If it wasn't for their political influence and stranglehold on Congress and State Legislative bodies there would not be such a problem.  Firearms reality: The media and politicians love to paint the National Rifle Association an enemy of civilization. They paint the NRA as an organization that actively tries to recruit people to carry out mass murders. The fact is the NRA has been around since the 1870's. And while the NRA does lobby on behalf of gun owners for ""reasonable"" laws the primary task the NRA performs is education. The NRA provides safety training. The NRA provides training for Range Officers and provides standards for firing range safety. Millions have been taught firearms safety through courses taught by the NRA or using NRA approved curriculum.  10. A 5 day waiting period on all car sales.  Firearms reality: As much as some politicians like to talk about how anyone can walk into a gun store put down a credit card and walk out with a gun every gun sale from a firearms dealer does require a background check that may end up requiring a waiting period. Unless a firearms dealer is told to ""proceed"" with a firearms sale and assuming there has not been a ""denied"" issued a firearm sale is subject to a hold.  These are just a few examples of what gun control advocates call ""reasonable"" proposals. However the public would be furious if for example a drunk driver hit a school bus killing several students and then politicians started shouting that we need a law to require Breathalyzer Ignition Interlocks on every single vehicle sold. Rightfully the general public would be outraged and stress that just because one person got drunk and used their car to cause a tragedy the rest of the driving population should not be punished. However the same general public is not concerned when politicians discuss banning a firearm from millions because one ""nut"" decided to use that weapon in a murder. The People would be outraged over restrictions to the purchases of automobiles yet driving is not a Constitutional Right; keeping and bearing a firearm is.  **** To be sure you see the latest discussion and commentary please follow Carden Chronicles on Facebook Twitter (@CardenBlog) or subscribe to email or RSS Feed updates at The Carden Chronicles website. ****  The Carden Chronicles is against the #GunControlNow Campaign  #2A #NRA #NRAILA #GoodGuyWithGun",political,Facebook

A new letter to the White House .... Why Not?  Dear Mr. Trump  I hope youre having a wonderful vacation golfing up a storm while the 31 people recently killed in two mass shootings are buried. It was so nice of you in fact to provide those celebratory thumbs-up photographs! Who wouldnt want to endure the grief of losings of a loved one if they just be in the picture with a smiling self-congratulatory president?  But instead of golfing you could be doing all of the following now:  1) Demand that McConnell call the Senate back into session NOW to engage with House-passed gun violence bills or use your own power under Article 2 Section 3 of the Constitution to convene the Senate yourself due to the extraordinary circumstances of our countrys affliction with gun violence;  2) Demand that Congress enact universal background checks;  (In fact as pointed out by the Washington Posts Fred Hiatt today in February you threatened to veto the House bill if it ever reached your desk.)  3) Demand that Congress ban assault-style weapons as it had done from 1994-2004;  (In fact again as pointed out by Mr. Hiatt youve promised to the NRA that no gun violence protection bills will ever be enacted while youre president.)  4) Demand that Congress ban large-capacity magazines;  5) Demand that Congress enact red flag bills that allow law enforcement officers to remove guns where there are credible threats of mental illness or domestic abuse.  A concerned emphatic president could do all of these things to show he or she was serious about gun violence prevention but you wont.  A concerned empathic president would give up a few rounds of golfs and spend his time browbeating recalcitrant Republican legislators into doing what the vast majority of the Americans want but you wont.  Right now the slaughtered and their families and friends are crying out in anguish and asking Why not?  Very truly yours  Bruce J. Berger,political,Facebook
